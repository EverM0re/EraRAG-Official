era ending after India loss, calls for more Tests\n\nAlyssa Healy has rejected any suggestion Australia\u2019s stranglehold on international women\u2019s cricket is slipping, saying their Test loss to India is barely a blip on the team\u2019s record.\nAustralia stumbled to their first Test defeat to India by eight wickets in Mumbai on Sunday, after being outplayed by the hosts in foreign spinning conditions.\nThe loss comes after one of the more difficult periods for the Australian side in the past six years, with the retirements of Meg Lanning and Rachael Haynes.\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\nAfter winning their fourth straight global ICC event earlier this year in the 50-over World Cup, Australia retained the Ashes via a drawn multi-format series in England in July.\nThat tour included losing four of six white-ball matches, with Australia\u2019s win in the Test enough to have them level on points with England and hold onto the trophy.\nThe current tour of India is not a multi-format series, but the defeat in the one-off Test marks Australia\u2019s first loss in a four-day game since January 2014.\nBut quizzed over whether the defeat suggested Australia\u2019s unprecedented period of dominance was ending, Healy was defiant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not even a blip,\u201d Healy said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt (Test cricket) is a format where we\u2019re not overly familiar with, in conditions that we\u2019re not familiar with.\n\u201cI see more positives out of this and than any sort of negativity.\n\u201cThere is always a lot of expectation and external noise about our team and how we\u2019re performing.\n\u201cThey are so used to seeing us winning, that I think, at times, they forget that we\u2019ve actually seen quite a lot of change over the last 12 to 18 months.\n\u201cThat kind of goes unnoticed external to our group.\u201d\nAustralia have spoken about shifting their mindset in white-ball cricket after the losses in England, pursuing a more attacking approach.\nThree looming ODIs against India in the next week and three ensuing T20s will be the first showing of that, with the hosts also a rising force in the white-ball game.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWithin our group we\u2019re really comfortable with where we\u2019re at, and the progression we\u2019re on,\u201d Healy said.\n\u201cUltimately there\u2019s a big T20 World Cup in Bangladesh towards the end of next year, that is a real carrot for us.\n\u201cThese are the sort of big trophies that we\u2019re wanting to win.\n\u201cAnd yes, every series in between now and then is important, but at the same time we\u2019re building towards that World Cup.\n\u201cMaybe you can ask me that (supremacy) question at the end of the six white-ball games to see how we\u2019re going and we can answer that.\n\u201cThese next six games will probably give us a better indication about how we\u2019re tracking but also what we might need to improve on.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHealy called for Australia\u2019s Test series in India to be extended to three matches their loss, their first in 11 Tests against India.\nThe hosts easily chased down 75 in the fourth innings on Sunday.\nAll out for 209 in their first innings, Australia looked far more confident in their second effort of 261 despite the wicket showing more signs of wear.\nAnd Healy believes three-Test tours of India would provide a better match-up between the two sides.\n\u201cIt would create a real contest over three games,\u201d Healy said.\n\u201cThat would be an unbelievable experience for our group, and probably a true test of of both sides\u2019 abilities.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe one-off Test, India playing in their home conditions, you\u2019d expect them to be heavy favourites.\n\u201cBut the way we tried to adapt and continue to learn throughout the four days was really impressive.\n\u201cWe would love to have another crack at it, show what we learned and put it into practice.\u201d\nHealy is realistic in conceding her wish is unlikely to be granted.\nThe last women\u2019s Test series of more than one match was way back in 2006, while India had not hosted any red-ball cricket for nine years before this summer.\n\u201cThe nature of the female game at the moment is it\u2019s very white-ball dominant,\u201d Healy said.\n\u201cTrying to fit it all in to the calendar and fitting all the white-ball games in seems to take precedence.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBut you take three one-day games out, and we could probably play two more Test matches.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s captain is also insistent this Test should have formed part of a multi-format series, in the same way most top-tier women\u2019s tours are now conducted.\nWhile one Test, three ODIs and three T20s will be played, each are individual contests rather than an overarching series in the same way the Ashes is decided.\nAustralia had taken the trophy used from the multi-format 2021-22 series against India to be contested, only to be told by authorities that system would not be used.\n\u201cI sit here disappointed that we couldn\u2019t win the Test match,\u201d Healy said.\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, we weren\u2019t necessarily playing for points, we weren\u2019t playing for overall series points for a trophy.\n\u201cIt does make it a little bit of a novelty in a sense.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe fact that it sort of feels meaningless to a sense is really disappointing to me. But in saying that we are disappointed that we couldn\u2019t get ourselves over the line.\u201d\n\u00a9 AAP\n\nThis article, authored by News, was published by The Roar | Sports Writers Blog on 2023-12-24 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":440}

Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\nThe NBA is home to the world\u2019s best basketball players and teams, with it being the pinnacle of the sport. Throughout its history, iconic figures like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan have left an indelible mark on the league. However, for the better part of the past two decades, players like Stephen Curry, LeBron James and Kevin Durant have dominated the NBA landscape. Their otherworldly talents have continuously captivated the fans across the globe. While LeBron James and Stephen Curry may have accumulated more championships and accolades, Kevin Durant, without a doubt, is universally acknowledged as the best pure talent of his generation.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nKevin Durant stands as one of the most exceptionally skilled players in NBA history. Across his illustrious 17-year career in the league, Durant has solidified his status as a transcendent superstar. His stellar performances over the years have endeared him to millions of fans. However, even with his exceptional talents, Kevin Durant regularly faces disregard from both the media and fans. This has made KD one of the most polarizing figures in basketball. Yet, when one considers the profound impact Durant has made on the NBA, the extent of the disrespect he encounters can seem perplexing at times.\nWhat makes Kevin Durant so polarising?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIt would be an understatement to say that Kevin Durant divides opinions. While some view him as the most skilled basketball player of his generation, others perceive him as a diva who rode the coattails of Stephen Curry to secure his two NBA championships. However, a careful consideration of Kevin Durant\u2019s game-changing impact and the multitude of accolades he has garnered throughout his illustrious career reveals a glaring reality: KD stands as perhaps the most disrespected icon of the sport.\nKevin Durant rose to prominence in 2007, when the Seattle SuperSonics drafted him with the No.2 pick. The NBA had never witnessed a player possessing Durant\u2019s unique skill set\u2014a 6\u201911\u201d forward renowned for his exceptional jump-shot and lethal three-point accuracy. He epitomized the concept of a \u201cUnicorn\u201d in its truest sense.\nMoreover, when one pays close attention to his stats, the disrespect becomes even more perplexing. Kevin Durant has amassed 27,393 points in the regular season, ranking 11th in NBA history. In the playoffs, he has contributed an additional 4,878 points, placing him 7th on the all-time list. Durant is a surefire future first-ballot Hall of Famer, boasting an illustrious resume that few can match. His accomplishments include two NBA titles, two NBA finals MVP awards, four scoring titles, and multiple selections to the All-Star and All-NBA teams.\nDurant\u2019s scuffles with critics\nWhile Durant may rank among the greatest NBA players in history, his vulnerability to criticism and thin-skinned nature has, on several occasions, has got the better of him. NBA legend Charles Barkley called Durant \u201csensitive\u201d in an interview with 60 Minutes. He said, \u201cHe\u2019s very sensitive. Great player. He\u2019s part of that generation who thinks he can\u2019t be criticized.\u201d\nDurant\u2019s susceptibility to criticism became glaringly evident when he utilized a burner account in 2017 to defend himself on Twitter. However, Durant was exposed when he inadvertently failed to switch accounts, posting a tweet through his verified account. Fans also criticize KD for his lack of leadership and his lack of titles since departing from the Warriors. Since his departure in 2019, Durant has not secured an NBA title. Despite forming a formidable trio with Kyrie Irving and James Harden in Brooklyn, their best result was a second-round exit in the 2021 playoffs at the hands of the Milwaukee Bucks.\nUSA Today via Reuters Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\/Reuters\nFans and media strongly disapprove of Kevin Durant\u2019s inclination to switch teams repeatedly, even when he receives substantial support from the organizations. After his Brooklyn experiment didn\u2019t work, KD requested a trade and, on last year\u2019s trade deadline, his wish was granted as the Nets traded him to the Suns. Despite having NBA stars like Devin Booker and Chris Paul as teammates, Durant once again fell short of winning a title with the Suns. Durant\u2019s inability to clinch an NBA title without Curry and the Warriors has heightened the narrative that questions his status as an icon of the game.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nThe decision that tainted Durant\u2019s legacy\nIn the 2016 Western Conference finals, KD-Russ led OKC Thunder faced off against 73-9 Warriors. After swiftly securing a 3-1 series lead, the Thunder seemed poised for an NBA Finals appearance. However, the Warriors orchestrated a remarkable comeback, ultimately winning the series in seven games. This meant that Durant would go trophy-less for another season.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn the 2016 offseason, Durant made a pivotal decision to join the very team that had defeated him in the finals. This move had profound consequences, leading to a shift in public opinion, with many labeling him as a \u201csnake\u201d and \u201cspineless.\u201d While Durant achieved the success he craved for in the Bay Area, his decision to join the Warriors has permanently cast a shadow on his legacy.\nWatch this Story: How Michael Jordan Comparisons Hampered Multiple MVPs for Lebron James: Gilbert Arenas Explains\n\nThis article, authored by Dushyant Singh, was published by Essentially Sports on 2023-12-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":441}
{"title":"With hopes of victory fading, Ukraine's fight against Russia could get even harder in 2024","context":"## With hopes of victory fading, Ukraine's fight against Russia could get even harder in 2024\n\nA Ukrainian soldier is seen inside an artillery vehicle in his fighting position as Russia-Ukraine war continues in the direction of Kharkiv, Ukraine on November 20, 2023. Diego Herrera Carcedo | Anadolu | Getty Images\nAt the start of 2023, hopes were high that a much-vaunted Ukrainian counteroffensive \u2014 expected to be launched in the spring \u2014 would change the dial in the war against Russia. It didn't, and the prospect of a breakthrough in 2024 is also unlikely, military experts and defense analysts told CNBC. They predict intense fighting is likely to continue into the next year but say Kyiv's forces are unlikely to launch any more counteroffensives. Russia, meanwhile, is likely to focus on consolidating the territory it has already seized, particularly in eastern Ukraine. Away from the battlefield, military experts said that the trajectory the Russia-Ukraine war takes in 2024 will mostly be dictated thousands of miles away in the U.S., Ukraine's largest military supporter, and whether aid declines in the run-up \u2014 and following \u2014 the U.S. presidential election. \"War is an uncertain endeavor,\" retired Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Twitty, former deputy commander of the U.S. European Command, told CNBC. \"Russia can win the war, or the Ukrainians can win the war. And, as you're seeing things now, if you really think about it, what has been achieved this year? Very little has been achieved by Russia, and you can say the same thing for the Ukrainians,\" he said.\nUkrainian servicemen take part in a military training exercise not far from front line in the Donetsk region on June 8, 2023. Anatolii Stepanov | Afp | Getty Images\n\"We're in this situation now where if there's not a clear winner, there's going to be a stalemate, and there's going to be, perhaps, a future frozen conflict. What can tilt the balance, in my view, is if the Ukrainians are not resupplied and they're not re-funded and they don't get the equipment and people that they need. Then this war could tilt to the Russians,\" Twitty noted.\nExpectations not met\nA year ago, Ukraine's international military support was solid with NATO pledging to support Kyiv for \"as long as it takes\" as it defended itself against Russia's invasion launched in February 2022. Over the summer, however, the challenge facing Ukraine's forces was glaringly obvious as they struggled to break through heavily fortified Russian positions and lines of defenses along a swathe of the 600-mile-long front line across the southern and east of the country. After liberating a handful of villages in the summer, Ukrainian and Russian forces have been caught in largely attritional battles, with neither side making significant gains. Ukrainian military officials have conceded that hopes and expectations of a great breakthrough in the counteroffensive were not met. Still, Ukraine's leadership says that steep losses have been inflicted on Russian forces and that its forces have made vital progress in other areas such as the Black Sea with Ukraine's audacious attacks on Russian bases and assets in Crimea this summer prompting the Russian navy to withdraw a number of warships from Sevastopol, handing Kyiv a victory in the battle of the Black Sea.\nPanorama of the city from a bird's-eye view, shot on a drone, covered with snow on December 7, 2023 in Avdiivka, Ukraine. Libkos | Getty Images\nWeather conditions are deteriorating in Ukraine, with mud, freezing rain, snow and ice making offensive and reconnaissance operations challenging. Intense fighting continues nonetheless, and particularly around Bakhmut and Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine where Russian forces are conducting offensive operations and have made some recent, confirmed advances. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted last week that Russian forces have likely committed to offensive operations in multiple sectors of the front, during a period of the most challenging weather of the fall-winter season, \"in an effort to seize and retain the initiative\" before the Russian presidential elections in March 2024. In the meantime, the ISW noted in an analysis, \"Ukrainian forces establish and consolidate defensive positions to conserve manpower and resources for future offensive efforts.\" Ukrainian forces have adopted a more defensive stance as circumstances dictate; a senior army general warned last week that front-line Ukrainian troops face artillery shortages and have scaled back some military operations because of a shortfall of foreign assistance.\nAid and politics\nAnother year of war in Europe has undoubtedly drained Western military resources and the political appetite to maintain massive amounts of military aid for Ukraine. Ongoing funding for Ukraine is far from secure in 2024 given the fact that the U.S. presidential election could herald a seismic change in the attitude toward and support for Kyiv. Specifically, all eyes are on former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, who cultivated close relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during his presidency. There are concerns that, given Trump's previous good relations with Moscow and \"America First\" policy, aid for Ukraine could be shelved rapidly. Defense analysts agree that much of the outlook for Ukraine is dependent on the outcome of the U.S. vote. \"I think it's important to understand the extent to which Ukraine is reliant on the U.S. right now, because it's quite significantly more reliant on the U.S. than it is on the EU,\" Sam Cranny-Evans, defense analyst at the Royal United Services Institute defense think tank, told CNBC. \"If the U.S. election goes in a way that is not in Ukraine's favor, coupled with the fact that the EU is not really stepping up to the plate \u2014 it's ammunition production is so far off what it should have been by now to give Ukraine a hope of surviving and a hope of victory \u2014 it's not a very cheery prediction for 2024.\"\nGood chemistry: President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands during a joint press conference after their summit on July 16, 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. Chris McGrath | Getty Images News | Getty Images\nRumblings of discontent over continuing Ukraine aid have been heard in some Republican quarters for months now, as well as in Eastern Europe. Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker told CNBC he believes American and EU aid packages for Ukraine will be approved come January, saying he believed this funding would tide Ukraine over for another year, militarily. Volker said that aid packages must include more advanced weaponry for Ukraine, however, like F-16 fighter jets which have been pledged by Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. Ukrainian pilots are beginning their training on the jets now but it could be a number of months before they're deployed in Ukraine. The U.S. is not providing F-16s to Ukraine but has authorized allies to provide their own jets. \"A couple of things ought to change,\" Volker told CNBC. \"We ought to lift restrictions on the weapons we're providing. We still don't provide the longest-range missiles and we still have not delivered any Western aircraft in Ukraine yet. Those things have to happen. And I think we have to try to give the Ukrainians more of a technological advantage,\" he noted.\nThe United States has said that it will begin flight training for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\nVolker believes that a Trump presidency might not be the catastrophe for Ukraine that is feared, but said it would make future funding uncertain. \"I doubt that even if Trump were elected that he would abandon support for Ukraine overall, because it would be a disaster for U.S. interests, and it would appear to be a failure. You'd have these images of Russians overrunning places, and brutality and so forth, so I don't think he wants that. But it's not clear exactly what he would do to try to end the war.\" For his part, Trump has said that he'd be able to resolve the Ukraine war \"in one day\" if he was reelected, saying he'd convince the leaders of Ukraine and Russia to make a deal.\nMore stalemate or negotiations?\nUkraine's Defense Ministry said last week that its main goal in 2024 is to boost its domestic defense industry in the face of uncertain future supplies from its Western allies. It has also changed conscription laws, foreseeing the need to bolster its forces, which are dwarfed in size by Russia's but are more highly trained and equipped. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that the military had asked for up to 500,000 additional conscripts but said he needed to hear \"more arguments\" to support the sensitive and costly proposal. With both Ukraine and Russia investing heavily in the war, it's unlikely there will be any negotiations to end the conflict or agree to a cease-fire. Defense analysts argue that neither side would want to go into negotiations unless they're in a position of strength and able to dictate terms. \"In the case of a Republican winning the presidential election next year, especially if that's Donald Trump, who seems to be the front-runner, and [if] funding is decreased substantially, then there will be increased pressure on Ukraine to negotiate,\" Mario Bikarski, a Europe and Russia analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC.\nA Ukrainian tank drives along the field on December 7, 2023 in Avdiivka, Ukraine.

The Hendrick Motorsports driver is the co-owner of the High Limits Racing Sprint Car Series, along with four-time World of Outlaws Series champion and brother-in-law Brad Sweet. The venture by the two motorsports athletes has been a success so far, and recently, one of their races pulled an extraordinary crowd, which included a rather popular figure in the world of motorsports, Dale Earnhardt Jr.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nJunior was present at High Limit Racing\u2019s Commonwealth Clash at the Lernerville Speedway on Tuesday. He and Brad Sweet used to have a working relationship, as the latter used to be a development driver for JR Motorsports in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. As per Larson, it was the former Cup Series driver who had requested a visit to the event and had also urged Kyle Larson to take part in the race, which he obliged. The 49-year-old was quite happy with his experience after the event, but before the action started, he conducted an interview with Larson and Sweet, where he asked about the origins of the competition.\nKyle Larson explains his goal of \u201cadding pressure\u201d to his competition\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nLarson has always been a fan of sprint car racing, so it really is no surprise that he decided to start a competition involving sprint cars. What is surprising is how he gets the time to look after his Cup Series title run and the competition at the same time. It really is quite commendable that he has been able to turn High Limits Racing into the success that it is today.\nSpeaking about how everything started with him and Brad Sweet, Kyle Larson said, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve always talked about having a series that\u2019s solely based around me or whatever, and I didn\u2019t really want that, you know. I wanted to help out the other racers really, and you know I got to. Really, my eyes opened to starting this deal when I started racing the late model, and you know, FloRacing has their Tuesday night late model series and, you know, pays 20 some thousand to win every Tuesday, and I was like, Why wouldn\u2019t that work in sprint cars?\u201d\nWhile others in Larson\u2019s position might have felt that being the owner of a competition would be too challenging to focus on their racing career, the Hendrick Motorsports driver welcomed it with open arms. He saw a business opportunity ripe for the taking, took his shot, and hit the mark.\nThe series obviously helps out both Sweet and Larson financially, given the fan following it has garnered, but it is also quite profitable for the drivers and the teams. The winning driver, who in this case was David Gravel, wins $50,000, and with crowds so big, it helps out the teams with merchandise sales.\nEvents like these also help to keep these smaller race tracks across the country in good shape. If a track isn\u2019t used or taken care of for an extended period of time, it will start to wear out and eventually become completely unsuitable for any kind of racing unless it is taken apart and rebuilt. But one of Kyle Larson\u2019s reasons for doing what he does with the High Limits Racing Sprint Car Series is a lot simpler, and he revealed that goal to Dale Earnhardt Jr. at the Lernerville Speedway.\n\u201cCan\u2019t Have Everything You Want\u201d- Dale Earnhardt Jr. Ruthlessly Trashes Home Track as He Endorses Wild NASCAR Rumors\n\u201cI was hoping this would add pressure to the weekend shows to raise their purses as well so I think we\u2019ve seen a big step in that this year and I think it\u2019s gonna continue forward so, I would say so far it\u2019s been successful,\u201d he added. Kyle Larson had taken part in the Lernerville race on Tuesday, only a couple of days after a hectic race in Texas, and it seems like he had brought some of that form into the dirt track race because he made a slightly similar mistake.\nCup Series hopeful has Texas deja vu at Lernerville\nWith just nine laps to the checkered flag, Kyle Larson was leading the race and seemed to take the victory and earn himself $50,000 in his own competition. However, much like what happened in Texas, Larson lost control of his car as he was trying to defend the lead of the race from co-owner Brad Sweet.\nUnlike Texas, he did not DNF and managed to get his car back on track, but his chance to win had gone. The Cup Series HMS driver could only finish in eighth place. A racer as competitive as Larson would have liked a win, especially after what had happened the Sunday before, but it was a good day for him as the owner as well.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nThe 2021 Cup Series champion is in the prime of his career and has a lot of years left ahead of him in NASCAR, but when he decides to hang up his boots, he will hope that the High Limits Racing Sprint Cup Series achieves a high level of national popularity and he will not have to take himself out of the racing business.\nWatch This Story: Dale Earnhardt Jr Reveals the Immediate Regret After Entering Bristol\n\nThis article, authored by Nilavro Ghosh, was published by Essentially Sports on 2023-09-28 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":443}

They have been eliminated in the group stage of two straight World Cup tournaments, an unthinkable slip in stature given they had never been bounced from any World Cup that early in history prior to 2018.\nWith Hansi Flick unable to steer the team to safer waters in Qatar, Julian Nagelsmann has taken over as new Germany head coach.\nAt just 36 years old, Nagelsmann is a rising star, having spent three successful seasons at Hoffenheim followed by two years at RB Leipzig, which catapulted him to the managerial post at Bayern Munich in 2021. He steered the Bavarian giants to the Bundesliga title in his first season, but he was sacked by the club in March of 2023 amidst a furious league title fight.\nNagelsmann's dismissal at Bayern Munich came as a shock to much of the European football landscape, as the club had performed exceptionally in the Champions League and was still very much in the title race, sitting just a point behind Dortmund. Now, with a chance for redemption at the helm of the national team, Nagelsmann will see his time begin with a friendly against the United States.\nMORE: A look at the 23-man squad for Gregg Berhalter as USMNT play Germany & Ghana\nGermany squad, players for USA friendly\nJulian Nagelsmann will be very familiar with much of the 26-man German national team squad, as five players hail from his former club Bayern Munich, including critical midfield duo Josh Kimmich and Leon Goretzka, who were instrumental in his setup at Allianz Arena.\nAlong the back, Nagelsmann has oddly selected five center-backs compared to just two natural full-backs in David Raum and Robin Gosens, both left-sided players, possibly indicating a desire to play a three-CB system, although it's hard to know for sure as Nagelsmann preferred a 4-2-3-1 for much of his club managerial career.\nOne of the center-backs present in the squad is Mats Hummels, who has not been called in since 2021 and dropped for the entirety of Hansi Flick's time in charge. This came at the expense of Hummels' Borussia Dortmund teammate Nico Schlotterbeck.\nFirst national team call-ups were handed to Kevin Behrens of Union Berlin, Chris Fuhrich of Stuttgart, and Robert Andrich of Bayer Leverkusen. There's a choice for Nagelsmann to make up front, as Niklas Fullkrug has been prolific in his short national team stint, but Thomas Muller is an experienced veteran who is still performing at a high level.\nInjuries for Nagelsmann to work around include Serge Gnabry who is out with a broken arm, and Timo Werner who has been touch and go at RB Leipzig with a back problem.\nGermany predicted starting lineup vs. USA (4-2-3-1): ter Stegen (GK) \u2014 Kimmich, Rudiger, Sule, Raum \u2014 Gundogan, Goretzka \u2014 Sane, Musiala, Brandt \u2014 Fullkrug.\nGermany second-choice lineup (4-2-3-1): Leno (GK) \u2014 Gross, Tah, Thiaw, Gosens \u2014 Andrich, Kimmich \u2014 Hoffman, Wirtz, Fuhrich \u2014 Muller.\nGerman national team squad for USA, Mexico friendlies\nPos Player Club Caps Goals GK Oliver Baumann Hoffenheim 0 0 GK Bernd Leno Fulham (ENG) 9 0 GK Marc-Andre ter Stegen Barcelona (SPA) 36 0 GK Kevin Trapp Eintracht Frankfurt 7 0 DEF Robin Gosens Union Berlin 18 2 DEF Mats Hummels Borussia Dortmund 76 5 DEF David Raum RB Leipzig 18 0 DEF Antonio Rudiger Real Madrid 62 2 DEF Niklas Sule Borussia Dortmund 47 1 DEF Jonathan Tah Bayer Leverkusen 17 0 DEF Malick Thiaw AC Milan (ITA) 2 0 MID Robert Andrich Bayer Leverkusen 0 0 MID Julian Brandt Borussia Dortmund 44 3 MID Chris Fuhrich VfB Stuttgart 0 0 MID Leon Goretzka Bayern Munich 53 14 MID Pascal Gross Brighton (ENG) 2 0 MID Ilkay Gundogan Barcelona (SPA) 69 17 MID Jonas Hoffman Bayer Leverkusen 22 4 MID Joshua Kimmich Bayern Munich 80 6 MID Jamal Musiala Bayern Munich 23 1 MID Leroy Sane Bayern Munich 55 13 MID Florian Wirtz Bayer Leverkusen 10 0 FWD Kevin Behrens Union Berlin 0 0 FWD Niklas Fullkrug Borussia Dortmund 9 7 FWD Kai Havertz Arsenal (ENG) 39 13 FWD Thomas Muller Bayern Munich 123 45\nJulian Nagelsmann tactics, style of play\nThrough his time at Bayern Munich, Julian Nagelsmann preferred a 4-2-3-1 formation with Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka holding down the lynchpin central midfield spots.\nHowever, as the 2022\/23 season progressed and results weren't as easy to come by, Nagelsmann switched to a 3-2-4-1 formation. This allowed him to deploy the likes of Alphonso Davies and Kingsley Coman very high up the pitch to provide width, while letting Jamal Musiala and Thomas Muller cook centrally behind a striker.\nThat 3-2-4-1 formation is flexible horizontally, as it allows one full-back to push high up the pitch while the other slots in along the back line, and thus sees the two central No. 10 players alternate pushing wide or pinching in to compensate.\nThis tactical setup is becoming popular with top-tier coaches across Europe, and has been used at various stages by the likes of Pep Guardiola, Stefano Pioli, Mikel Arteta, Edin Terzic, and many others.\nIn either setup, the forward line will shift horizontally to allow a midfield player to drive into space, and given options once halted to either play into the crowded forward line or release a bombing full-back to the off side, both of which can stretch or confuse an opponent's defensive unit.\nHaving spent time in the Red Bull system, Nagelsmann also deploys a complicated press that, like Gregg Berhalter, starts with the lone central striker. The goal is to force the opponent to play the ball into overload traps out wide, or if the opponent plays centrally, a defensive midfielder would step up at the base of a diamond (with two midfielders on the sides and the striker at the top) which would overwhelm an opposition midfield trio.\nHow will Germany play under Julian Nagelsmann?\nThe question, now, is how all this will translate to the German national team.\nLooking at Julian Nagelsmann's first squad of 26 players, the biggest question is which formation he will play. There are no natural right-backs on the roster, meaning he will either have to pidgeonhole a center-back (Antonio Rudiger or Niklas Sule) out wide, sacrifice Josh Kimmich's presence in midfield to move him back, or move Pascal Gross back. None of those are ideal options.\nWhether Nagelsmann deploys a 4-2-3-1 or a 3-2-4-1, the tactical approach will likely remain the same.\nGetting the best out of young superstar Jamal Musiala will be one of the most important aspects of Nagelsmann's tenure, as Musiala has blossomed into a world-class talent at Bayern Munich, but the 20-year-old has just one goal in 23 international caps to this point.\nNagelsmann will also look to introduce a few overlooked players, starting with Robert Andrich who could factor into the midfield setup as a traditional No. 6, especially as Ilkay Gundogan enters the twilight of his career. The new boss will also want to raise Kimmich's level of play back to old heights, as the ever-present Bayern star has seen his level drop in recent years for both club and country but remains a special talent.\nGermany criticized for travel schedule vs USA, Mexico\nThe DFB has taken significant flak from the German press for their travel to North America to play the United States and Mexico.\nThere's likely some form of superiority complex involved, with those following the German national team surely miffed that a European giant is traveling across the globe to meet CONCACAF sides with far thinner World Cup resumes. However, a closer look at their travel schedule does invite some questions as to how they've made use of the international break.\nMost notably, the Germany squad will return to Europe just a single day prior to Borussia Dortmund's first match out of the break, which sees BVB play Werder Bremen on Friday, October 20. Bayern Munich have their first game back against Mainz on Saturday, as does much of the Bundesliga.\n\"I don't know if I'd be interested in playing against Mexico in America before [the Euros hosted] in Germany,\" said Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel prior to the international break. \"I don't know if anyone can explain this in a way that I can understand. I don't know who decided it, but it has been decided.\n\"There is a difference between a busy schedule and everything away from home and in different time zones. This is at the end of the endurance. No coach in the world at this level will say otherwise.\"\n\"I don't understand the trip to the USA \u2014 for a variety of reasons,\" said former Germany international Lothar Matthaus to German outlet Bild back in the summer. \"I would have tried to create a good atmosphere in Germany before the Euros. That's why I would be in all 10 European Championship stadiums for the friendly matches and would have shown myself there once as a DFB selection. That can create a mood. But what do we want in the US at this point?\"\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Bonn, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-06 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":444}

Read our privacy notice Thanks for signing up to the\nFootball email {{ #verifyErrors }} {{ message }} {{ \/verifyErrors }} {{ ^verifyErrors }} Something went wrong. Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nCole Palmer is a man on the move, from Manchester City to Chelsea, from perennial substitute to pivotal starter, from England Under-21 player to, perhaps, a senior international. It has been a few months of swift change. He is trying to get used to new surroundings, having swapped south Manchester \u2013 in his native Wythenshawe \u2013 for the South.\n\u201cThe most annoying thing? The traffic, that\u2019s the biggest thing for me. Everything else I am enjoying. It is hotter than Manchester as well,\u201d he said. Certainly Palmer feels hot property right now, albeit while exhibiting a certain coolness. He was calm enough to score an injury-time penalty for his new club against his old on Sunday, completing a 4-4 draw, and cheeky enough to poke his head into a City huddle when they were lining up a free-kick, to the amusement of Erling Haaland.\nPerhaps it summed up Palmer\u2019s inability to feel intimidated by anything that he marked his goal against City with a shrug. There was no getting carried away. \u201cI spent 15 years at the club,\u201d he noted. \u201cI can\u2019t really go and celebrate how I would celebrate if I have scored a 95th-minute equaliser because it would have been disrespectful.\u201d\nThe alternative explanation is that Palmer has scored so many major goals in the last few months that this was merely another. He struck in the Community Shield and the European Super Cup for City, against Arsenal and Tottenham for Chelsea. That big-match temperament may equip him for tournament football in an England shirt. So, too, his nerveless penalty-taking.\nPalmer in training at St George\u2019s Park this week (PA)\nHe has, in effect, anointed himself as the spot-kick taker for the \u00a31bn team, taking the ball at Turf Moor to open his Chelsea account. \u201cIt was just an in-game thing, really,\u201d he said, with a matter-of-fact stance. \u201cOnce I scored at Burnley, I just thought: \u2018I\u2019ll take them\u2019.\u201d If penalties have been the English disease, Palmer has no hesitation when asked if he would be willing to come off the bench as a specialist from 12 yards for a shootout. \u201cYeah, I would be,\u201d he said.\nHe is not daunted by the last penalty he missed, as a substitute in the shootout when City lost the 2019 FA Youth Cup final to Liverpool. He can only remember failing from 12 yards on one other occasion, \u201cwhen I was dead, dead young versus [Manchester] United,\u201d and a willingness to take responsibility is similarly apparent in open play. \u201cI think I am a player who always wants the ball, anywhere, to try and help the team get out of a difficult situation or create a chance,\u201d he said.\nIf he has created an opportunity for himself with his country because of his excellence at Stamford Bridge, it had not formed part of his thinking. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking of an England call-up when I first went to Chelsea,\u201d he said.\nNor, indeed, was it on his agenda as a boy, when his mother banned him from playing in the garden. \u201cI was always breaking her pipes,\u201d he recalled. He has come a long way since then; particularly in 2023. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s been crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe changes have happened so fast. From winning the Euros to signing for Chelsea then getting signed up here.\u201d\nPalmer chats with Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka (The FA\/Getty)\nHis part in England Under-21s\u2019 European Championship win may have caught Gareth Southgate\u2019s eye. His immediate decision was whether he had done enough to impress Pep Guardiola. There had been interest in taking him on loan, from Brighton and Burnley and RB Leipzig. City decided that he could only leave on a permanent deal and Chelsea forked out \u00a342.5m. \u201cWho knows what would have happened if I had stayed?\u201d Palmer mused. \u201cMaybe I would have played more, maybe not. But I think the decision to go to Chelsea so far is paying off.\u201d\nThat is an understatement. And if there seemed a risk involved in swapping the stability of City for the seeming madhouse of Stamford Bridge, there was evidence of more cool-headed thinking from a 21-year-old. Chelsea have been manic buyers but he said: \u201cI did look at how many players were there but I don\u2019t think people realise how many players they actually got rid off, as well.\u201d\nThe departures of, among others, Mason Mount, Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Joao Felix, meant there could be opportunities in the attacking midfield positions. \u201cI looked at the squad and thought: \u2018If I go there and know what I can do then I\u2019ll have the chance of playing\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thankfully it\u2019s happened.\u201d If there seemed plenty of traffic in the queue for places in Southgate\u2019s attack, Palmer seems to have accelerated past several rivals. Now an England debut could follow in the next week.\n\nThis article, authored by Richard Jolly, was published by The Independent - Sports on 2023-11-15 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":445}
{"title":"David Benavidez vs. Demetrius Andrade fight predictions, odds, undercard, expert picks, start time, preview","context":"## David Benavidez vs. Demetrius Andrade fight predictions, odds, undercard, expert picks, start time, preview\n\nWhen two great fighters have been avoided by top opponents for so long, it inevitably makes sense for them to fight one another in order to get to the top.\nThat's the working theory being undertaken by former two-division champion Demetrius Andrade (32-0, 19 KOs), who has spent most of his career doing the unfruitful chasing of big names like Canelo Alvarez, Gennadiy Golovkin and Jermall Charlo.\nAndrade, 35, will finally get his shot at the super elite, and potential recognition among the pound-for-pound best in the sport, when he faces former two-time super middleweight titleholder David Benavidez (27-0, 23 KOs) on Saturday in a 168-pound clash at the Michelob Ultra Arena at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Showtime PPV, 8 p.m. ET).\n\"Fighters don't want to fight but I'm glad David has nowhere to go,\" Andrade told CBS Sports last month. \"It only makes sense to fight me.\"\nFresh off a resounding decision win over former champion Caleb Plant in their March PPV clash, the 26-year-old Benavidez, who was born in Arizona to parents of Mexican and Ecuadorian descent, has seemingly been hand-picked by boxing's foundational Mexican-American fan base as the eventual successor to Alvarez.\nBenavidez, like Andrade, is hoping a breakthrough victory against such a tricky opponent will be the final rung on the ladder that needs to be climbed before finally getting the call to challenge Alvarez for his four-pack of world titles in the division.\n\"To be honest, I don't know what that man is doing,\" Benavidez told \"Morning Kombat\" last month when asked about Alvarez. \"I feel like every time I say something, people say that I'm just looking for a payday. I have been the mandatory fighter for the past two years. I won the title eliminator first and then the WBC interim, which guarantees you a spot. So, the fact that the fight hasn't happened is really crazy to me.\n\"This man is just making it worse for himself because I am gaining so much experience. I'm getting very comfortable and I'm not going nowhere. As soon as I get in the ring with Canelo, all of those belts will come to me.\"\nCan't get enough boxing and MMA? Get the latest in the world of combat sports from two of the best in the business. Subscribe to Morning Kombat with Luke Thomas and Brian Campbell for the best analysis and in-depth news.\nDon't let the ambitious hopes of both fighters and their collective lust for one day sharing the ring with boxing's biggest star as a means to suggest they are overlooking one another.\nBenavidez may have previously been his own biggest enemy throughout a career that saw him become the youngest champion at 20 in divisional history back in 2017 only for him to twice be stripped of his WBC title (once for a failed drug test for cocaine and a second time mid-pandemic for missing weight). But the maturity he has shown in recent years has been noteworthy, as was the performance he put together against Plant where Benavidez entered in top physical shape and simply wore his smaller opponent out over 12 rounds.\n\"I'm trying to prove to the world that I'm the best super middleweight on this planet,\" Benavidez said. \"I'm going to definitely show that because I have had a tremendous training camp. I have been working for three months already and have been getting some great rounds of sparring. And this is the final Showtime [pay-per-view] so we have to go out with a bang.\n\"These are the type of fights that interest me because Demetrius Andrade is a great fighter, no doubt about that. But I get to test my heart and test my spirit in front of everybody. I know that when people make me reach deep down, the best of myself comes out. So, we are looking forward to this.\"\nWhat makes this matchup so interesting is that Andrade, a 2008 U.S. Olympian from Rhode Island, is the kind of Swiss army knife boxer whose colorful personality has never been able to offset the fact that opponents have always looked at him as high risk and low reward.\nAndrade is a lengthy southpaw who relies on speed and guile to awkwardly navigate the center of the ring without paying for the real estate thanks to his elite defensive skills. But to try and suggest this fight has been a long-time coming for Andrade would be an insult to just how difficult his professional journey has been as it relates to trying to attract big-name opponents.\nAlthough Andrade has looked great earning respectable wins at 154 and 160 pounds against the likes of Vanes Martirosyan, Brian Rose, Willie Nelson, Jack Culcay and Maciej Sulecki, the big names have routinely avoided him. Throughout the process, Andrade has also found himself perpetually stuck in promotional Siberia and admits to having considered walking away multiple times due to frustration.\nAll of that appeared to change upon his signing with top advisor Al Haymon's Premier Boxing Champions in late 2022. What followed was a wide decision win over Demond Nicholson in his super middleweight debut in January, on the undercard of the Gervonta Davis-Hector Luis Garcia PPV card, which set up an opportunity to face Benavidez once it was clear Alvarez wouldn't be part of his 2023 plans.\n\"People have avoided me and have not wanted to fight [but] if you put the very best in front of me, I'm going to be the very best and I'm going to elevate,\" Andrade said. \"That's just what it is.\" I did throw my hands up at one point because of the situation that I was in. Clearly, it was not working out and there needed to be a separation here and a divorce. That has been pretty much what I have had to do in order to be in this position where I am today.\n\"This is more in my hands now. There are no obligations to a manager or a promoter. I do have a solid team that I trust and work with but nothing is on paper. Free at last, free at last. Thank ole, almighty God that I am free at last.\"\nAndrade might be more well known for his ability to hit and not get hit but that hasn't stopped him from declaring his willingness to defeat Benavidez under any means possible, even if that leads him to stand in front of Benavidez and trade.\nIt's a prospect that Benavidez would prefer, of course, although he is well prepared to do the chasing if he has to, similar to how he broke down Plant eight months ago.\n\"If he is going to give me a war then I'm looking forward to it because I'm a warrior and I can't wait to go in there,\" Benavidez said. \"The way I go into every fight is to think that every opponent is going to be the best that they can be. He's a slick boxer so I am expecting him to be at his best but this is what I have done for a long time. I love figuring guys out and I have hurt everyone that I have been in the ring with.\n\"I am the smarter fighter and I am the faster and hungrier fighter.\"\nAndrade said he doesn't expect Benavidez to be anything but in the best shape of his career this weekend but wants to make one thing clear to critics and\/or oddsmakers, including those who have installed him as a 3-1 underdog: He is not Caleb Plant.\n\"Listen, people definitely get up for Michael Jordan, you know? So, I would assume [Benavidez] would get up to fight myself,\" Andrade said. \"But I'm not Caleb Plant, in no way, shape or form. There are sayings out there that we fight a like because we both box but we do not fight alike. I get to put all of my own questions out there and get my answers, as well. It will be my time to get up there and let the A game of Demetrius Andrade come out. I haven't been able to bring that out [in a while]. This will be two cats fighting each other rather than one cat fighting a mouse.\"\nThe other fight of note on Saturday marks the return of WBC middleweight champion Jermall Charlo when he takes on Jose Benavidez Jr., the older brother of David Benavidez. Charlo has been out of action since June 2021 as he has dealt with out-of-ring issues with his family and his own mental health. Now, he looks to knock off the ring rust when he takes on Benavidez Jr. in a 10-round non-title bout. Benavidez Jr. picked up his first win in five years in August.\nLet's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event.\nBenavidez vs. Andrade fight card, odds\nDavid Benavidez -440 vs. Demetrius Andrade +335, super middleweight\nJermall Charlo -700 vs. Jose Benavidez Jr. +500, middleweight\n\nSubriel Matias -350 vs. Shohjahon Ergashev +275, super lightweight\n\nHector Luis Garcia -290 vs. Lamont Roach +235, super featherweight\nBenavidez vs. Andrade info\nDate: Nov. 25\n\nNov. 25 Location: Michelob Ultra Arena -- Las Vegas\n\nMichelob Ultra Arena -- Las Vegas Start time: 9 p.m. ET\n9 p.m. ET How to watch: Showtime PPV ($74.99)\nPrediction\nThose who have followed Andrade's career close enough will realize that he does have the skill set to pull off the upset. The biggest questions surround whether he can take the kind of pounding that Benavidez's downhill style unleashes, especially in the second half when \"The Mexican Monster\" seems to only get stronger.\nOne of the most underrated aspects of Benavidez's game is how deft he can be blocking or avoiding counter fire while operating at close range and trading punches. While most would expect Andrade to rely on his footwork in the first half, he will need to be certain that he's banking enough rounds before Benavidez's inevitable mid-fight adjustment kicks in and his pressure increases.\nAndrade's power is more of the accumulative kind over the course of rounds and not of the one-punch variety, which will make it difficult to dissuade Benavidez from coming forward. And that's the key to potentially bringing an edge with you to the ring against him because Benavidez's style is so fan and judge friendly as a come-forward attacker that it's difficult to bank close rounds against him because he's not only typically the busier fighter, he's also the one landing the majority of the power shots.\nIf Andrade can't hurt Benavidez or confuse him so thoroughly that it forces him away from his game plan, the best he can hope for is a moral victory of going the distance as Benavidez takes one massive step closer to the Alvarez bout which will likely define his pro career.\nPick: Benavidez via UD12\n\nThis article, authored by Brian Campbell, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-11-25 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":446}

{"title":"Israel\u2019s startup ecosystem: down but not out","context":"## Israel\u2019s startup ecosystem: down but not out\n\nThe world is still coming to terms with Hamas\u2019 deadly attacks on Israelis last weekend \u2014 and everything else that has unfolded so far in the aftermath, including the barrage of retaliation strikes on Gaza.\nUndoubtedly, the ramifications for the technology ecosystem pale in comparison to the human toll that the fighting is taking, on both sides. But when considering how the wider region will weather the destruction, and one day recover, it\u2019s an important industry to consider. Please also read here about how this is playing out for Palestinians in Gaza and beyond. And a below, we show how a look at how the situation is playing out in the startup ecosystem in Israel sheds light on its impact to the country as a whole.\nIn such a small country, just about everyone knows someone who was directly affected by the attacks, or someone involved in the subsequent defense and retaliation \u2014 and often all three.\nTechnology is, without question, a giant part of Israel\u2019s economy. In 2022, it contributed more than 18% of the country\u2019s GDP, the most of any single sector, according to the latest annual report from the Israel Innovation Authority.\nA total of 14% of Israeli citizens work in high tech, which in a country of just 9.2 million people works out to about 1.3 million. The active number of startups in the country is 9,000 (third-highest in the world after the Bay Area and NYC) and these startups have collectively, in the last five years, brought $95 billion into the country by way of venture capital.\nCombining the business development of startups with larger tech companies in the country \u2014 Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and many others have operations in Israel \u2014 they collectively exported $71 billion last year, 48.3% of the total amount exported across all industries.\nUndoubtedly, those numbers are all going to be significantly lower this year, not least because the disruptions of this war are coming directly on the heels of a major protest movement.\nThe tech industry led opposition to the government\u2019s bid for judicial reform. Even before the fighting started, it was voting with its feet, and some companies and investors are already refusing to do business in the country with the prospect of the reforms getting pushed through. (That effort, in turn, has been brought to a halt: People on the two sides of that debate are now standing together for what they see as the significantly bigger fight and threat.)\nEven before last weekend\u2019s assault, startup investment in Israel was way down from the prior year. As TechCrunch\u2019s Anna Heim reported in July, \u201cWith a provisional tally of $3.2 billion for the first half of the year, funding activity in Israel dropped by 73% compared to the same period in 2022, IVC data shows.\u201d Other countries and regions have reported similar declines in their private-market capital flows this year.\nAs the war enters its sixth day, many people are being called up to the reserves, or volunteering to help in other ways. With the tech industry skewing younger, it\u2019s estimated that anywhere between 10% and 30% of all of Israel\u2019s tech employees are getting mobilized. More than 500 VCs have pledged their support of the efforts, too.\n\u201cIn the spirit of peace and unity, we encourage the global venture community to support and engage with Israeli startups, entrepreneurs, and investors as they navigate through these challenging times,\u201d the signatories wrote.\nTo better understand the on-the-ground situation for Israeli entrepreneurs, we spoke to a number of startup founders, PR people who work with startups and investors. The predominant response was that the businesses have to continue to operate as best they can, to help ensure the economic viability of the country.\nMaking sure everyone is OK\nThe founders and operators that we spoke to stressed after they ensured the safety of their teams, they have gingerly started to approach how to resume work. It\u2019s not a simple formula.\n\u201cCurrently, the emphasis is on finding a balance between supporting Israeli team members, some of whom want to keep working to clear their minds a little from what\u2019s happening, and some who cannot even think of working,\u201d Omer Davidi, CEO & co-founder, BeeHero, an Israeli agritech startup, told TechCrunch. \u201cThe priority is to focus on core company operations, especially in the short term, as we await a clearer understanding of the unfolding situation,\u201d Davidi said.\nYonatan Cohen, co-founder and CTO of Quantum Machines, says that the war is clearly affecting people, but they are returning to work. \u201cI can\u2019t deny that we all had trouble concentrating on work during the first few days of the war, \u201d he said. He points out that several of his employees have been called to active duty, but those who weren\u2019t are beginning to concentrate on work again in spite of the circumstances.\nShuly Galili, founding partner at venture capital firm UpWest, says the situation is complex, but companies are doing their best to navigate the challenges of operating in war conditions. \u201cPeople are being called up,\u201d she said, adding that there are some startup denizens, who are in the U.S. and are looking to get back and serve, but responses to the war extend beyond military service. \u201cAt this point many who are not called to serve are volunteering to provide equipment, medical supplies and food. Many technical developers are building tech to manage logistics and help communities deal with the aftermath of the situation,\u201d she added.\n\u201cThe call for reserve duty has affected a notable percentage of our workforce. I\u2019d estimate that at least 10% of our citizens have either enlisted or volunteered for the army,\u201d said Kfir ben Shooshan, founder and chairman of scooter startup Inokim. \u201cThis has inevitably strained many businesses,\u201d he said.\nLazer Cohen, whose company Concrete Media works with many startups, says people are contributing however they can, but the businesses need to keep running, too.\n\u201cLooking at our clients and my agency, 10-25% of Israeli team members have been called up to reserve duty,\u201d he said. Others on the team are helping by donating blood, hosting survivors of the attacks, packing supplies for soldiers or covering for a team member who was called up.\nThe economy matters, too\nWhile everyone is concerned about the war and its fallout, startup founders and their investors also recognize the importance of keeping these businesses going. For most Israeli startups, the customer base is global and for many, their go-to-market teams are in the U.S. and hence not directly affected by the war. The current situation may slow down product development but won\u2019t directly affect sales in the short run.\nWhile customers have been understanding for the most part, Cohen says that companies are working to continue operating under difficult conditions.\n\u201cAs we come out of the initial shock and horror of the attack, many tech workers and executives see it as their duty to keep the tech industry up and running. Technology is Israel\u2019s biggest export and the main engine of our economy and with a long and difficult war ahead, it\u2019s crucial that we keep working and innovating,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\nSharon Seeman, a partner at YL Ventures, says that it\u2019s important that companies maintain communication with customers. \u201cEnsuring the continuity of business operations is vital for Israeli startups in maintaining their customer relationships,\u201d she said.\nWhat might be a more tricky situation will be when startups come around to the inevitable cadence of their existence: raising money to scale their operations, and then doubling down and scaling those operations. Should the region and country continue to be at war, how will that play out with would-be startup investors and the LPs of startup investors?\nOurCrowd founder and CEO Jon Medved believes that in the long run, the Israeli startup ecosystem will remain reslient. \u201cThere is no doubt that in the long run \u2014 a year or more \u2014 Israel\u2019s tech ecosystem will emerge from this war, stronger, bigger, with more investment and returns for investors,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s tech ecosystem has well proven its resilience in past conflicts with Hamas. Israel is focused on deep tech, semiconductors, AI, mobility, fintech, cybersecurity, quantum, agtech, the cloud, devops, clean energy and so much more and as the future unrolls, these areas will grow in importance and Israel will continue to play a leading role in all of them.\u201d\nOren Yunger, managing partner at GGV, says his firm will do what it takes to make sure that the Israeli startups in his company\u2019s portfolio don\u2019t go bankrupt due to the war.\n\u201cI can say with absolute confidence \u2014 even if we don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take and who\u2019s going to be affected \u2014 I am 100% sure that none of our companies will go bust as a result from this moment in time,\u201d he said.\nMike Butcher, Frederic Lardinois, Anna Heim and Kyle Wiggers also contributed to this report.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-13 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":448}

{"title":"Adobe: Thanksgiving US online sales nudge up to $5.6B; Salesforce: $31.7B spent globally","context":"## Adobe: Thanksgiving US online sales nudge up to $5.6B; Salesforce: $31.7B spent globally\n\nThanksgiving Thursday, when stores in the U.S. are closed and many are spending time off work, has become the de facto start of the holiday shopping season both for those looking to get bargains online and for online retailers to kick off holiday sales deals to meet that demand. But if there is a message from this year\u2019s Thanksgiving sales, it is that consumers are holding steady, but don\u2019t hold your breath for a growth boom.\nAdobe Analytics said that people in the U.S. on Thursday spent $5.6 billion online, which it calculates at an increase of just 5.5% on last year.\nSalesforce, which also calculates sales based on data collected by its Commerce Cloud division, noted that globally, online sales reached $31.7 billion with its U.S. tally at $7.5 billion \u2014 both up only 1%. Salesforce\u2019s calculations of average order value were equally modest. Globally, average orders were up just 2% to $103 per \u201cbasket\u201d while in the U.S. they were up a paltry 1% to $119.\nMobile devices had a standout year: Adobe said that some $3.3 billion was spent over mobile devices on Thanksgiving, up 14% and an all-time record for the day.\nSalesforce added that online traffic in general to e-commerce sites, which includes browsing, was up too, but again only in single digits of 4% globally and 6% in the U.S.\nThe two are actively tracking sales for today, Black Friday, and for the whole of the \u201cCyber Weekend\u201d \u2014 which not only kicks off holiday shopping but has a particularly strong showing in online sales due to people traveling to be with family. As a bellwether for the rest of the holiday period \u2014 traditionally the biggest period for retail sales in the year \u2014 the flat sales speak to another tough year for online retailers.\nAdobe Analytics is predicting $37.2 billion in online spend for the full five days, up just 5.4% year on year and accounting for 16.8% of all holiday spend. And Black Friday will see $9.6 billion in sales, up roughly the same, 5.7%, versus figures last year. (The published figures in 2022 were $9.13 billion.) Salesforce has not provided forecasts.\nFor some context on today\u2019s Thanksgiving figures, last year\u2019s published figures from Adobe were $5.29 billion, which actually represents an increase of just under 4%. (It\u2019s likely Adobe Analytics readjusted its final figures for last year, which is why we see a higher percentage of growth.) Today\u2019s 5.5% rate is definitely an improvement on last year\u2019s 2.9%. But it\u2019s nothing compared to the years preceding COVID-19, such as 2017, where we were seeing growth of 18% or more.\nInflation is making an impact but not as much as the worry around consumer spending, said Adobe, which said that spending is being led actually by more discounts to encourage buying, rather than less buying of more expensive products. That leads one to wonder what kind of impact that\u2019s having on retailers\u2019 margins.\n\u201cCyber Week is off to a strong start with Thanksgiving driving a record $5.6 billion in online spend as consumers took advantage of strong discounts and continued their shopping plans, virtually,\u201d said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. \u201cMobile shopping hit an all-time high, as shoppers took to their smartphones to get the best deals during holiday gatherings, further solidifying mobile\u2019s growing importance in e-commerce.\u201d\nAdobe Analytics\u2019 figures are based, it says, on 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million SKUs and 18 product categories. Salesforce says it taps data from 1.5 billion consumers in its research. (Both companies work with a number of giant and smaller retailers, so they have the infrastructure to provide this kind of intel to these customers on an ongoing basis.)\nBreaking out some of the trends in how people are shopping:\n\u2014 Overall, desktop sales are still exceeding other kinds of screens when it comes to conversions and number of items purchased, but mobile is the standout device in the evening hours, when it accounted for a whopping 59% of all online sales (likely because people were using that time to socialize and buy on the sly).\n\u2014 More on mobile: Salesforce said that for the day, mobile accounted for 79% of all online traffic globally and 82% in the U.S., and that mobile wallets were really making a mark for reducing some of the buying friction on the smaller devices. Apple Pay saw transactions up by 47% compared to 44% up for all mobile wallets overall. Social on mobile \u2014 think Instagram links, TikTok and Snapchat \u2014 has become an influencer in itself. These collectively accounted for 13% of all traffic referrals to sites. Notably, they are not where the purchases are being made for the most part, though.\n\u201cMobile traffic and sales are soaring as people are on the go once again this holiday weekend,\u201d said Salesforce VP and GM, Retail, Rob Garf, in a statement. \u201cConsumers are embracing mobile wallets to break down friction between discovering on social and purchasing on mobile.\u201d\n\u2014 Retailers are really pushing out discounts to get people more willing to spend money this year. Both Adobe and Salesforce said in the U.S. discounts were up by about 28%. Categories that saw dramatic markdowns included toys, electronics and computers, per Adobe\u2019s figures; respectively these saw sales up by 182% and 113% over last month.\n\u2014 Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) remains a popular option for paying upfront. BNPL drove $390 million in online spend, Adobe said, up 7.5% on last year.\nWe\u2019ll update with more data later, and with Black Friday figures as they start to emerge.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-24 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":450}
{"title":"\u2018Biggest win of my career\u2019: De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final","context":"## \u2018Biggest win of my career\u2019: De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final\n\nThe second of Sinner\u2019s Djokovic victories came in Italy\u2019s impressive Davis Cup semi-final triumph over Serbia, after saving three consecutive match points on serve, before besting the world No.1 again in the doubles. World No.4 Sinner, coached by Australia\u2019s Darren Cahill, is the first player to topple Djokovic twice in the same season since Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev in 2019. Italian teammates Lorenzo Sonego and Jannik Sinner will face Australia in the Davis Cup final. Credit: Getty However, if Popyrin can get the job done in the No.2 singles then Australia will, at minimum, reach the doubles with a live chance, and a good one, with 2022 Wimbledon champions Max Purcell and Matt Ebden to be unleashed. The query is whether Italian captain Filippo Volandri will turn to Lorenzo Musetti, who battled a leg issue at the end of his three-set loss to Serbia\u2019s Miomir Kecmanovic, or one of Lorenzo Sonego or Matteo Arnaldi.\nPopyrin won his only ATP Tour clash with Musetti \u2013 who has been as high as No.15 in the world \u2013 in a tight two-setter at last year\u2019s Miami Masters, but the emerging Italian claimed three of their four showdowns at the next level down. He is yet to play against Sonego, who Arthurs expects to play. \u201cI\u2019m assuming they will back in Popyrin because he played pretty well a couple of nights ago, and with his firepower \u2013 he\u2019s probably the key to the tie,\u201d Arthurs said. \u201cHe\u2019s showing all the signs of becoming a top-25 player in the next couple of years. His junior career suggested he was going to be a very good player, and it\u2019s unusual for someone to win the junior French Open and not go on to something big. Alexei Popyrin celebrates with Australian captain Lleyton Hewitt after his Davis Cup win. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThese moments can be a big springboard for someone like Alexei. He\u2019s a confidence player, and this is a very big moment \u2013 whoever he plays, Musetti or Sonego. But he\u2019s got to go out and embrace the moment, and he\u2019s the type of player who will enjoy it.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to give de Minaur a chance with his fighting abilities, but the way Sinner has played the last six months, you\u2019d have to say Sinner is the favourite.\u201d Loading Hewitt animatedly embraced Popyrin after his straight-sets victory over 171st-ranked Finn Otto Virtanen, but Australia\u2019s Davis Cup captain would be even more thrilled if he could repeat the dose against Italy. Australia could also turn to an alternative No.2 singles option, with Jordan Thompson and Purcell waiting in the wings. \u201cIt\u2019s everybody\u2019s dream to play for their country,\u201d Popyrin said. \u201cI looked up to Lleyton, looked up to all the older Aussie legends. To be able to put on the green and gold, to be able to go out there and play for your country, no matter the format, if it\u2019s this Davis Cup or the old Davis Cup, you give your all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nerves, it\u2019s pressure \u2013 you\u2019re playing for everybody back home. It\u2019s something that nothing will ever compare to ... it really was the biggest moment of my career to get the first live rubber win, to get one foot into the final. It was something that I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Loading Australia, who lost last year\u2019s final to Canada, has enjoyed a soft run on paper to this year\u2019s decider, eliminating the Czech Republic and Finland \u2013 with neither country boasting a top-30 singles player \u2013 but will have earned their 29th Davis Cup title if they account for Italy. Canada defeated Italy in the Davis Cup round-robin matches in September, but bowed out to Finland in the knockout stage without Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov, who have both battled injury and form. The final is due to start at 2am AEDT on Monday and will be broadcast on 9GEM.\nSinner ends Djoker\u2019s Davis Cup dream Novak Djokovic\u2019s dream of capping his great season by blasting Serbia past Australia in the Davis Cup final was blown up by Jannik Sinner\u2019s extraordinary double triumph over the world No.1. Instead, in the Davis Cup final in Malaga, Australia will face an Italy team running hot on the heroics of their golden boy Sinner, who beat Djokovic in both the singles and the doubles in the space of five exhilarating hours in their semi-final on Saturday (Sunday AEDT). Jannik Sinner saved three match points before going on to beat Novak Djokovic. Credit: Getty Images In one of the great Davis Cup rubbers, Djokovic had held three match points against Sinner and was on the verge of a completing a relatively workaday 2-0 victory for the Serbs.\nBut for only the fourth time in his unparalleled career, Djokovic was beaten from match-point up as Sinner roared back to complete his second victory over the master in just 12 days, winning 6-2, 2-6, 7-5. The 22-year-old Sinner, by now an irresistible force, then re-emerged to team up with Lorenzo Sonego and spray massive forehand winners around liberally as they outplayed a by now weary-looking Djokovic and Miomir Kecmanovic 6-3, 6-4. Djokovic had three match points in the singles rubber. Credit: Getty Images It was a crushing end to Djokovic\u2019s hopes of ending his triumphant season, which has featured three grand slam victories and an ATP finals showdown victory over Sinner just six days ago, with a second Davis Cup title. After telling fans to \u201cshut up\u201d earlier in the week, he again got irritated with the crowd in the doubles, pretending to be the conductor to the Italian fans\u2019 deafening chorus, but though he may be the greatest player who ever picked up a racquet, doubles looks an alien game to him.\nHis serve was broken in the first set and his court positioning left a big hole for Sinner to blast his forehand through the world No.1 and Kecmanovic, who had earlier worn down Lorenzo Musetti 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1 in the tie\u2019s opening singles. The tie, though, will forever be remembered for Sinner\u2019s comeback triumph in their third brilliant singles duel in less than a fortnight. This time, the Sinner of the Turin group stages re-emerged, the young titan reprising his victory of 12 days ago when he became the only man since Djokovic\u2019s Wimbledon final loss to Carlos Alcaraz to defeat the 24-time grand slam champion. Here he did something even more astonishing when, after soaking up immense pressure throughout the deciding set, he stared at 0-40 on his serve at 4-5. Yet the 22-year-old proved absolutely nerveless, firing down an ace to save the third of the three match points, and then immediately turning the tables by breaking Djokovic in the very next game amid wild Italian celebrations in the stands at the Palacio de deportes Martin Carpena.\nSinner then served out for a famous win, ending Djokovic\u2019s cherished unbeaten 21-singles winning streak in the Davis Cup and becoming the first man since 2019 to beat the Serb in singles twice in the same year. The drama between the two rivals wasn\u2019t over, as the two teams inevitably both drafted in their top singles players into the doubles decider. Sinner was again magnificent and still looking ominously fresh after more than four hours on court, with Djokovic\u2019s weak backhand into the net off the Italian\u2019s second serve in the doubles on match point seeming to sum up his disappointment. The beneficiaries of all this? Lleyton Hewitt\u2019s Australian side, who were happily enjoying a day\u2019s rest at their team hotel further down the Costa del Sol, watching the drama unfold on TV.\nWhile the Italy tie didn\u2019t finish until 8.15pm after a noon start, Alex de Minaur and co should be fresh for combat in Sunday afternoon\u2019s (Monday AEDT) final as they seek to lift the Davis Cup for the first time in 20 years. AAP De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final Lleyton Hewitt has declared his close-knit tennis band of brothers will give it \u201ca hell of a shake\u201d to bring back the Davis Cup to Australia after they roared into another final in Malaga. Following their 2-0 victory over Finland in Friday\u2019s semi-final, executed superbly without a dropped set in singles wins for Alexei Popyrin and Alex de Minaur, team captain Hewitt said he couldn\u2019t be prouder of their achievement in making back-to-back finals.\nAnd even though they\u2019ll be facing either a Serbian side led by world No.1 Novak Djokovic or an Italian team inspired by young superstar Jannik Sinner in Sunday\u2019s (Monday AEDT) final, the inspirational de Minaur was adamant: \u201cNo one really wants to play us.\u201d He delivered once more for Australia, taking an 11th victory in his last 13 cup singles matches, sealing Friday\u2019s (Saturday AEDT) win by defeating Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4, 6-3.

It meant the Australians\u2019 crack doubles team of Max Purcell and Matt Ebden weren\u2019t even needed.\nIt will be Australia\u2019s 49th appearance in the Davis Cup final, as they seek the trophy for the 29th t28-time champions Australia, in a 49th final, seek a first win in the World Cup of men\u2019s tennis in 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019re a very solid squad, a lot of depth in every single position, and if we can get ourselves to a deciding doubles, we\u2019ve got an unbelievable pairing as well,\u201d de Minaur said. \u201cSo we singles guys have just got do our best to try and get a win and let the doubles guys do the job. \u201cHopefully we can go one better this year,\u201d he added, recalling the 2-0 defeat by Canada in 2022. De Minaur had been the hero on Wednesday, pulling out an extraordinary comeback win over Jiri Lehecka with Australia on the verge of defeat in their quarter-final with the Czech Republic.\nBut he was happy to pass the laurels to Popyrin, a late squad replacement who\u2019d been asked to take on the troublesome \u201csecond singles\u201d role by Hewitt. Loading \u201cAlexei hasn\u2019t played for Australia in a very long time [two years], had a massive match today against a very high-quality opponent and dug super deep,\u201d said de Minaur. Popyrin managed to deliver a rock solid game, making only 11 unforced errors to his erratic opponent\u2019s 25, to prevail in just under an hour-and-a-half. \u201cIt was probably the biggest win of my career,\u201d he admitted. \u201cTo win a match that means so much to us, it\u2019s an honour and something I\u2019ll never forget. Nothing compares to this.\n\u201cI thought I was ready but when I came out and heard the two sets of fans chanting so hard, but it was nerves that I\u2019ve never experienced before.\u201d Loading It wasn\u2019t easy. The pressure was on with Thanasi Kokkinakis, the injured teammate he\u2019d replaced, Purcell and Jordan Thompson having all lost opening singles ties in this year\u2019s competition, and Popyrin struggled too against a big-hitting 22-year-old going for broke. But after repelling a set point in the opening stanza, Popyrin\u2019s solidity in comparison to his increasingly erratic opponent helped silence a noisy contingent of Finnish fans, who\u2019d been hoping to cheer their underdogs to a first-ever final. De Minaur, cheered on by his excited mum, then didn\u2019t need similar heroics to Wednesday\u2019s as he overcame the loss of the first two games.\n\nThis article, authored by Ian Chadband, was published by The Age on 2023-11-24 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":451}
{"title":"A field guide to the vampire authors who were probably vampires","context":"## A field guide to the vampire authors who were probably vampires\n\nVampire fiction has a long and distinguished pedigree in English. From the moment that Robert Southey introduced the British Isles to the concept of the coffin-sleeping undead at the turn of the 19th century, the authors of vampiric stories have mirrored the changing face of the society that reads them.\nWe're spending a week diving deep into the stories behind your favorite vampires. Who says we only get to celebrate vampires at Halloween?\nAnd yet, scholars have largely turned a blind eye to one lingering question: Which of these authors were, themselves, nosferatu? Was night-stalking Lord Byron secretly a daywalker? Could it be that Anne Rice\u2019s innate understanding of deathless sexiness is itself a result of her fellowship in the camp of the undead?\nUntil we understand which writers have been secretly propagandizing for Dracular overlords, our understanding of the place of vampires in anglophone culture will never be fully complete. So in the interest of bettering the cause of human understanding and avoidance of unwilling resurrection, we present the following field guide to secretly vampiric authors, past and present.\nJohn William Polidori\nBest-known vampire book: The Vampyre (1819)\nWhile the concept of vampires goes back at least as far as Balkan folktales from the middle ages or earlier, its history in the English-speaking world began in earnest with Dr. John William Polidori\u2019s novel The Vampyre at the turn of the 19th century. The book itself has as high-class an origin as any bloodsucker book could ask for, having been born at a Swiss chalet, in the same spooky story contest where Mary Shelley hatched the idea for Frankenstein. The contest entry for another participant, Lord Byron, was the tale of an aristocratic Englishman who is secretly an ancient, unkillable force of evil. Being too lazy to actually write the story himself, Byron passed along the idea to his personal physician and party guest, Polidori, who spun it out into his novel three years later.\nPolidori had always had an adorably puppy dog-ish devotion to Byron \u2014 that mercurial, temperamental, but undeniably sexy man of the late-night hours. So it\u2019s not surprising to see the doctor\u2019s depiction of the book\u2019s vampiric main character, Lord Ruthven, take on a certain erotic charge. Ruthven is described as cruelly sadistic, mockingly contemptuous of others, yet desperately desired by those around him for reasons even they can\u2019t entirely explain.\nHe is, in other words, a pathetically obvious stand-in for Byron himself, and Polidori\u2019s almost unwilling attraction to his questionable friend marks him out as a classic human thrall of an undead overlord.\nVerdict: Not a vampire, but Byron\u2026 vampire all the way\nBram Stoker\nBest-known vampire book: Dracula (1897)\nThe real breakthrough moment for vampires in the English-speaking world came just before the turn of the 20th century with the publication of Bram Stoker\u2019s appropriately immortal novel Dracula. Stoker\u2019s story of a Transylvanian count who takes residence in the U.K. in order to launch a centuries-old plan of vampiric conquest and enslavement became the source of pastiches, spinoffs, and cliches almost from the moment it arrived. As a result, its influence codified many of the basic elements of vampire storytelling for the next half-century or more: the foreign, undead aristocrat whose cosmopolitan charm and suave allure stood in for English fears and paranoias about the allure of other nations and races; the bloodsucking conversion process (targeted, invariably, against either women or the more effeminate among the male set) that reads alarmingly like seduction; the tricks and traps of the vampire hunters that range from wooden stakes to garlic to sunlight to good old simple beheadings.\nStoker\u2019s own biography is almost the inverse of his noble-born immortal count, but it\u2019s still fittingly enigmatic for the writer of the seminal work of undead fiction. Born to a middle-class Protestant Irish family in the 1840s, Stoker\u2019s life grew progressively more bizarre: Among other things, he took a keen interest in the occult studies of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as well as the history and practices of the Freemasons. Cultivating a public reputation? Seeking inspiration for a never-materialized new hit story? Perhaps. Then again, it\u2019s just possible that somewhere along the way, Stoker had acquired a membership to the most elite secret society of all.\nVerdict: Vampire\nStephen King\nBest-known vampire book: \u2019Salem\u2019s Lot (1975)\n\u2019Salem\u2019s Lot, Stephen King\u2019s second published book after the breakout success of 1974\u2019s Carrie, concerns (obviously) a writer who returns to his childhood hometown in (obviously) rural Maine, only to discover gradually but gruesomely that the entire society is in thrall to the undead.\nIf the vampire stories of the Victorian era had used their monstrous antagonists as allegories for the deepest fears of the fading 19th century, King\u2019s novel was an encapsulation of post-Watergate suspicions that government corruption had infected all levels of the community. But just as notable as King\u2019s modernizing of the vampire novel is his decided and inarguable resemblance to creature of the night himself.\nIn addition to famously dwelling in the least accessible reaches of rural New England, and maintaining a schedule, lifestyle, and an ability to defy death that would make Rasputin blush (dude survived a direct hit from a car, just for starters), King has also been frozen in an ageless state that could fairly be described as \u201cnon-specifically ancient\u201d throughout his career. He\u2019s not only a vampire, but it could be reasonably argued that he\u2019s not even trying very hard to hide it. Still, given King\u2019s recent and high-profile stances against corporate power and in favor of trans rights, it has to be admitted that he makes a strong case for vampire kind.\nVerdict: Vampire (complimentary)\nAnne Rice\nBest-known vampire books: The Vampire Chronicles series (1976-2018)\nEver since the Victorian era, vampires in fiction have stood in for all the sexual urges, temptations, and repressed fears burbling below the surface of a repressive society. But until the late 20th century, subtext is where those messages stayed buried: charged little winks to audiences that may have led to genre success, but could never actually be stated out loud by any character on the page.\nIt would take until the 1970s for those themes to finally take center stage. Not coincidentally, it would take a woman to do it. When Anne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire reached bookshelves in 1976, it was a watershed moment for vampire novels \u2014 the first time a mainstream book had prominently featured vampires that were gay, campy, and unapologetically fabulous.\nFor that alone, you might mistake Rice for a classic vampire-infected propagandist for the cause, but the case is a little muddier than that. Rice had a famously ambivalent relationship with the Catholicism of her youth, first turning away from it in favor of sexy gothic monster books, then embracing it in the early 2000s to pen a series of Christ-themed religious fiction, then finally rejecting the Church once more over its conservative social positions (\u201cIt\u2019s simply impossible for me to \u2018belong\u2019 to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group,\u201d she wrote on her Facebook page at the time). Even so, religious flirtation is canonically one of the few things a vampire can\u2019t tolerate even in small doses, so this is one case in which the jury is no longer out.\nVerdict: Not a vampire\nLaurell K. Hamilton\nBest-known vampire books: Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series (1993-present)\nLaurell K. Hamilton\u2019s vampire novels are like the final evolution of an undead Pok\u00e9mon. Where Anne Rice made vampires sexy but still took pains to remind readers that they were fundamentally the stuff of nightmares, Hamilton\u2019s Anita Blake series is more like the merrily obscene aesthetic of a 1970s grindhouse flick. Her characters bash, slaughter, and jump one another\u2019s bones (animated or otherwise), but it\u2019s all in good fun. With her books, the sexy and violent vampire has reached a Looney Tunes stage of madcap romp, and audiences can\u2019t get enough of it.\nBut does that make Hamilton herself a vampire? I\u2019d argue to the contrary. Nothing serves the vampire cause less than undermining the air of looming menace that they\u2019ve been cultivating since the 15th century. Vlad the Impaler worked for that nickname, dammit, and the last thing they need is for an airport novel to make a stake through the heart look fun. No, Laurell K. Hamilton isn\u2019t among the denizens of the undead. She\u2019s the one thing they\u2019ve come to fear this millennium: a good punchline.\nVerdict: Not a vampire\nTaika Waititi\nBest-known vampire work: What We Do in the Shadows (2014, 2019-present)\nWhile What We Do in the Shadows isn\u2019t actually a work of prose fiction, and Waititi isn\u2019t actually an author, who is to say what constitutes true literature, anyway? Regardless, What We Do in the Shadows, which Waititi co-created along with his fellow New Zealander Jemaine Clement (the two wrote and directed the original 2014 movie) is surely the most culturally pervasive piece of vampire-themed fiction to reach mass audiences over the past few years. Just as importantly, it marks the necessary next step in the inexorable movement of vampiric lore from creeping terror to sexy camp to outright comedy with only the faintest twist of terror to remind us of its origins. Two centuries after its English-language birth, the vampire genre has at last been metaphorically defanged. We humans have taken its blood and sucked it dry for our amusement.\nAnd what can we say about Taika Waititi? Here is a director and writer who started out charmingly likable, beloved by both audiences and critics; he was happily invited into our homes; rapidly wore out his welcome; and, almost before we knew what had happened, he has curdled into an odorous pestilence we couldn\u2019t seem to be rid of (when you lose the Chris Hemsworth demographic, you know you\u2019re in trouble). And yet, here we are, coming back for more, year after year, drawn to him by a force we are powerless to explain \u2014 when it comes to Our Flag Means Death, we are all Renfields. And what, after all, could serve the vampire cause better than to trick us into thinking the threat had passed? My friends, we haven\u2019t just found a vampire. We have found their king.\nVerdict: Dracula\n\nThis article, authored by Zach Rabiroff, was published by Polygon on 2023-11-09 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":452}
{"title":"The best surprise vampires in things you did not expect to see vampires","context":"## The best surprise vampires in things you did not expect to see vampires\n\nWe're spending a week diving deep into the stories behind your favorite vampires. Who says we only get to celebrate vampires at Halloween?\nYou know what\u2019s cooler than a vampire story? A story that\u2019s not a vampire story, but surprise \u2014 it has vampires.\nThe surprise vampire is a rich tradition, unfolding across many different media intended for all kinds of audiences. Sometimes it is a prominent part of a story that\u2019s made richer for the unexpected presence of a bloodsucker.\nSometimes it is subtle, an easily missable detail that rewards only the most observant. In the best version, the vampires are always there, in the background, waiting for you to discover them \u2014 just like in real life.\nHere are some of our favorite examples.\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3: Astarion\nIf Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 was your introduction to the Forgotten Realms of Dungeons & Dragons, you might be shocked to find out about a lot of stuff that\u2019s tucked away in the world\u2019s most famous tabletop role-playing game. The great thing about Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is how it centers all that weird stuff \u2014 like Astarion, a haughty elf that you can either play as or recruit to your party very early on, and guess what? He\u2019s a vampire! And dealing with his vampirism is a huge part of the game, should that be something you want to do.\nThe Matrix Reloaded: The Merovingian\u2019s Henchmen\nLike a lot of ideas in the Matrix movies, a seemingly throwaway line leads to a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it scene with wild implications for everything you\u2019re looking at. In The Matrix, The Oracle tells Neo that things that go bump in the night are in fact real, the result of a program misbehaving, an error in the virtual world of The Matrix. In The Matrix Reloaded, we meet some of those misbehaving programs in the form of the Merovingian\u2019s henchmen. The Merovingian\u2019s wife, Persephone, notes that they are very hard to kill \u2014 before she kills one of them with silver bullets. While the twin ghosts get significantly more screen time in Reloaded, the world of the films gets much more interesting when you realize that they are just two members of a whole assortment of ghoulies, and a superhuman kung fu god isn\u2019t the only cool thing a character can be in these movies.\nThe Elder Scrolls: Everywhere\nThe fantasy of the Elder Scrolls games often presents as very straightforward. With the exception of Morrowind, each of the games starts out as a pretty up-the-middle fantasy setting, with nary a twist of any kind. But a big reason Elder Scrolls games have an enduring fan base is down to the fact that beneath the surface, there is always weird shit to find. Like vampires! And in keeping with the open-ended role-playing philosophy the series espouses, you can also become a vampire \u2014 it kicks ass.\nPreacher: Cassidy\nPreacher, the comic book by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon \u2014 and its subsequent TV adaptation from Sam Catlin, Evan Goldberg, and Seth Rogen \u2014 starts with the basic assumption that God is real, and has walked out on the job. A lot of things are fair game at that point, namely angels, demons, and the like, but it\u2019s still a shock when you meet Cassidy. A brawling, hard-drinking Irishman that\u2019s already a load of fun when you meet him, Cassidy shoots up the power rankings when he sinks his teeth into a poor sap, because he\u2019s a vampire.\nSpider-Man: The Animated Series: Morbius\nHands down the ballsiest Spidey villain to adapt in a cartoon for children that censors wouldn\u2019t even let use the words \u201csinister\u201d or \u201ckill,\u201d Morbius \u2014 the Living Vampire \u2014 frankly had no business being in a Saturday morning lineup. The clever folks behind Spider-Man got around the strict content standards of their network with a loophole that might be even creepier than how vampires normally feed: by giving him little suckers on the palms of his hands that drain victims of \u201cplasma.\u201d\nHilariously, a creative application of vampirism would be how the show would later adapt another villain normally too violent for kids TV: Carnage, a serial killing symbiote who now \u201cdrained\u201d his victims\u2019 \u201clife force\u201d instead of cutting them to bits.\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse: Miguel O\u2019Hara\nMiguel O\u2019Hara, the Spider-Man of 2099, is one of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u2019s big enigmas. Comics readers will know plenty about his whole deal, but the movie doesn\u2019t really explain much \u2014 except for a brief scene where he\u2019s shown to have fangs, and an offhand reference that he is kind of a vampire? Sure, he\u2019s a jerk, but he\u2019s still kind of cool. It\u2019s kind of hard not to be cool when you\u2019re a vampire. That\u2019s kind of the whole quandary with vampires as a metaphor.\nAdventure Time: Marceline the Vampire Queen\nFor 11 episodes, Adventure Time was a show with lots of weird shit, but no vampires. Then \u201cEvicted!\u201d introduced Marceline the Vampire Queen, and the show changed forever. Marceline was key to what the show would go on to do so well: use its goofy sensibilities to tackle existentially dark and frightening things quite seriously without losing its edge, and play with familiar tropes to create a fantasy like no other. Now with vampires!\nSesame Street: The Count\nI don\u2019t really know why there\u2019s a vampire on Sesame Street. I love him, though.\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Vamp\nThe Metal Gear Solid games are kings of the nonchalant narrative curveball. It\u2019s a series that takes great care to ground itself in near-future militaristic realism and hard sci-fi, only to suddenly introduce a man made of bees and a cyborg ninja. Vamp is one of those curveballs, the member of a rogue special forces unit with a superhuman resistance to injury, the ability to run on water, and a taste for blood \u2014 with an eerie origin story for that hunger, to boot.\nThe Bone Clocks: The Anchorites\nDavid Mitchell loves to write books that start as one thing then end up as another. But he writes them knowing that people know he\u2019s famous for this, so he often turns these books into other things still. It\u2019s a real trip. The Bone Clocks, then, is a book about a psychic girl who gets into a bit of a pickle, only to learn about vampiric ghosts called Anchorites, who achieve immortality by murdering others. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t spoil the book for you. I just thought you should know about the vampires.\n\nThis article, authored by Joshua Rivera, was published by Polygon on 2023-11-15 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":453}

{"title":"Warner Music Group boss Robert Kyncl on AI, why labels still exist, and 2 other things we learned from his Q&A at the Code Conference","context":"## Warner Music Group boss Robert Kyncl on AI, why labels still exist, and 2 other things we learned from his Q&A at the Code Conference\n\nMBW Reacts is a series of analytical commentaries from Music Business Worldwide written in response to major recent entertainment events or news stories. MBW Reacts is supported by JKBX , a technology platform that offers consumers access to music royalties as an asset class.\nIn recent months, Warner Music Group CEO Robert Kyncl has been keeping a close eye on AI in the music industry \u2013 not surprising, given that he came to the music biz from \u2018Big Tech\u2019, namely YouTube, where he was Chief Business Officer.\nNor is it surprising, given his current role, that he has been pushing for price hikes at music streaming services.\nBoth of these topics came up during Kyncl\u2019s Q&A session at the Code Conference in Laguna Niguel, California, on Tuesday (September 26).\nBut what was maybe more surprising \u2013 for a techie like Kyncl, anyway \u2013 was his rational, level-headed explanation for why traditional music labels continue to be relevant, and continue to thrive, in the current music ecosystem.\nWith the arrival of digital platforms, including open ones like YouTube and SoundCloud \u2013 and with the proliferation of indie music distribution platforms like DistroKid and TikTok\u2019s SoundOn \u2013 it\u2019s inevitable that music biz observers from the world of tech like to speculating about the possibility that music labels could, in the long-term, be headed for irrelevance.\nIn a world where anyone can record music using a desktop audio workstation (DAW) and upload it direct to YouTube, or to Spotify via a distribution platform, labels have little left to do, the argument goes.\nKyncl offered strong a counterpoint to this argument at Code Media, drawing a parallel between music labels today and the advertising industry a decade or two ago.\nAt that time, he said, many predicted ad agencies were headed for the scrap-heap thanks to the arrival of Google\u2019s AdWords, which allowed any business to set up a customized ad campaign on Google services.\nYet ad agencies didn\u2019t go extinct. Today, \u201cthey\u2019re the largest customers of companies like Google,\u201d Kyncl told the audience at the Code Conference.\n\u201cIn the year 2000, when AdWords came out, everybody was predicting their deaths because all the brands [could] just go direct to AdWords and buy ads\u2026 However, what happened was lots of different platforms emerged. Lots of ad tech emerged, complexity increased exponentially, and brands needed help with that, and the agencies provided that value.\n\u201cAnd I see a very close analogy [between that and] our business. Music is incredibly broadly distributed. Everybody on earth listens to music. We\u2019re on every platform. And the complexity is high. And the more people can upload content, and the more people can be heard, the greater the noise, which means it\u2019s harder to cut through the noise and sustain a career.\u201d\nBut a label\u2019s value is not just about building an artist\u2019s career \u2013 it\u2019s about sustaining it once that career is established as well, Kyncl explained.\n\u201cWhen they become established, it is also hard to remain at the top,\u201d Kyncl said. \u201cSo their goals change. And again, we\u2019re there to help with that.\u201d\nHe added later that if you\u2019re a music artist, \u201cyou need a team. You need an army behind you\u2026. if you want a sustainable career, with repeatability and success.\u201d\nHere are three other things we learned from Kyncl\u2019s talk at the Code Conference\u2026\nCredit: Tatiana Shepeleva \/ Shutterstock 1) Music will feel the impact of AI before other industries do \u2013 \u2018within the next year\u2019\nKyncl predicted that the music business will be out ahead of other industries when it comes to exploiting the potential of AI, and it will also \u2013 out of necessity\u2013 be ahead on the issue of how to regulate and monetize the use of AI by non-rights-holders.\n\u201cMusic \u2013 because it\u2019s so broadly distributed and it\u2019s so well aligned with the internet, because it\u2019s short format, it lends itself to recommendations, it\u2019s on all platforms \u2013 is generally first in most transformations and most innovations. So it digitizes first,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhatever happened to the music industry 20 years ago is starting to happen in the movies and TV shows now. In the meantime, music emerged out of [digitization] better and stronger and more resilient. So, I would imagine the same will happen here, which is we\u2019ll likely be first.\u201d\nAsked when that sea change will occur, Kyncl said: \u201cI would say within the next year you will see lots of evolution around AI\u2026 What you will likely see is increasing quality at a very fast pace.\u201d\nKyncl drew an analogy between the explosion of AI use among members of the public and the explosion of user-generated content (UGC) a decade or two ago. Just as user-generated content often infringed on copyright, so too does AI threaten the rights of artists and music rights holders.\n\u201cI would say within the next year you will see lots of evolution around AI\u2026 What you will likely see is increasing quality at a very fast pace.\u201d Robert Kyncl, Warner Music Group\nIn Kyncl\u2019s view, the solutions put in place to address UGC form a \u201cblueprint\u201d than can be used to address AI-generated content on platforms as well.\n\u201cWhen YouTube was formed\u2026 people started to upload content, including copyrighted material, which, obviously, put YouTube into hot water with lots of different copyright holders. And I had the privilege of working through a lot of that and fix it up.\n\u201cBut we made we made a very important decision, which was to go above and beyond the law, and build a fingerprinting software that allowed us to track the copyright on our platform, and then have commercial relationship[s] with copyright holders to send them the money. Out of that we built a multi-billion-dollar business, which now is a multi-billion-dollar business per year. And it was an incredible new revenue stream for everyone. AI is that with new super tools.\u201d\nKyncl was referring to YouTube\u2019s Content ID system, which scours uploaded videos for copyrighted content (video and audio), then offers the copyright owner the option to monetize that video, or to request that it be taken down. The innovative system has essentially allowed YouTube users to upload content without paying much attention to copyright, while ensuring that copyright owners are paid.\nWhen it comes to the proliferation of AI, \u201cwe need to approach it with the same thoughtfulness, and we have to make sure that artists have a choice,\u201d Kyncl added.\nAnd he made it clear that, in his view, simply rejecting AI and fighting against it is not an option.\n\u201cYou have to embrace technology, because it\u2019s not like you can put technology in a bottle. The genie is not going back.\u201d\nBut he cautioned that the technology to develop a Content ID-style system for is \u201cnot yet developed, but\u2026 people are working on that.\u201d\n{Believe CEO Denis Ladegallerie might disagree. In comments earlier this year, Ladegallerie said that the tools to recognize and flag AI-generated content are just about ready to go, and he expects to see them implemented in the coming few quarters.)\n2) The streaming audio business won\u2019t experience the same problems currently hitting streaming video\nThe streaming video business is going through tough times.\nNetflix experienced its first-ever decline in subscriptions last year (though it has since roared back to health); the subscriber count of Disney+ appears to be in freefall; and talk is growing about ongoing consolidation of the many streaming video services that have come online over the past several years.\nAsked if the audio streaming business is likely to go through something similar, Kyncl\u2019s answer was unequivocal.\n\u201cNo. Music is much more resilient. So first, I think what happened in the last 15 years is incredible. They had literally zero people in the subscription model and now we have 700 million people in the world in the premium experience\u2026 which is incredible.\n\u201cAnd I think really credit goes to Daniel Ek for forging the path for everybody. And then companies like Apple and YouTube and Amazon following and building up the [music] business. It\u2019s pretty incredible what has happened.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to embrace technology, because it\u2019s not like you can put technology in a bottle. The genie is not going back.\u201d Robert Kyncl, Warner Music Group\nKyncl added: \u201cI think the opportunity ahead of us is twofold. One, the continued growth in emerging markets, and also the GDPs of those countries will be rising at the same time. So there\u2019s lots of growth there. And then there is the price elasticity optimization in mature markets.\u201d\nThat last point is a reference to the price hikes seen among all the major music streaming services over the past year or so, and the growing belief within the music industry that streaming price hikes will be sustained \u2013 as evidenced recently by Deezer\u2019s second price hike in a year.\nCredit: QuiteSimplyStock\/Shutterstock 3) The hot music rights acquisitions space is \u2018likely slowing down a bit\u2019\nThe second half of 2022 saw a notable slowdown in music rights acquisitions, a phenomenon that some blamed on higher interest rates and the reduced liquidity that came with them.\nAlthough there has been something of a rebound this year, in Kyncl\u2019s view, there is still a slowdown in this space \u2013 though that might be good for Warner Music Group.\n\u201cI think what happened was there was an opening where artists and songwriters were suddenly open to selling catalogs. which they were not open to before. And they just created this incredible tidal wave. And these things happen in waves, ebb and flow.\n\u201cSo I think it likely is slowing down a little bit, but that\u2019s okay. Because it makes the multiples come down a little bit more.\u201d\n\u201cI think what happened in the last 15 years is incredible. They had literally zero people in the subscription model and now we have 700 million people in the world in the premium experience.\u201d Robert Kyncl, Warner Music Group\nIn other words, Warner Music can go out and buy more if the multiples are low enough?\n\u201cOf course. We are in the business of buying catalogs, obviously. We have the publishing catalog of David Bowie, for instance, which we bought a few years ago. So yeah, we are in that business.\n\u201cWe are in the business of administering [rights], which means collecting revenue from thousands of platforms around the world; very complicated matters. But we\u2019re also in the business of ownership.\u201dMusic Business Worldwide\n\nThis article, authored by Daniel Tencer, was published by Music Business Worldwide on 2023-09-28 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":455}
{"title":"French soccer players back African mobile video network StarNews Mobile in $3M round","context":"## French soccer players back African mobile video network StarNews Mobile in $3M round\n\nAfrican mobile video network StarNews Mobile has secured $3 million in pre-Series A funding. StarNews offers African content creators a platform for monetizing their work through a subscription model. Currently, the service is available in six African countries, including Cameroon (where it started), Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Benin and Ivory Coast.\nFounder and CEO Guy Kamgaing launched the startup in 2017. His inspiration for this venture draws from his extensive 10-year experience in content monetization, particularly within the VAS (Value-Added Services) business. During this period, he actively participated in text\/SMS-based campaigns and monetization endeavors, which provided the foundation for StarNews.\nThe five-year-old mobile video network prioritizes offering monetization avenues for African content creators through distribution partnerships with major telecommunications operators like MTN and Orange. Content creators often face challenges in generating revenue due to limitations on existing streaming platforms. As a result, StarNews connects them to mobile users who often lack access to relevant content due to expensive mobile data plans and a shortage of services tailored to local markets. A win-win for both parties.\n\u201cI realized that while I could monetize jokes and horoscopes via telcos for several years, no one was monetizing content on the traditional platforms, especially in Africa,\u201d said the \u200b\u200bLos Angeles-based Cameroonian entrepreneur to TechCrunch. \u201cThere are thousands of creators online that don\u2019t make money on YouTube or other platforms. So it was just putting two and two together, saying, \u2018Well, this content is here that no one knows about and is very difficult to get the audience on YouTube and search, but I can help creators make money because I have a relationship with the telcos.\u2019\u201d\nMobile operators are pivotal in propelling content within Africa\u2019s media industry, with unmatched distribution capabilities. Collaborating closely with these operators is imperative for establishing a solid presence in the market. Over the past few years, these operators have been instrumental in driving data usage across the continent, simultaneously upselling their customers with in-house content or partnering with entities like StarNews. To draw a parallel, Kamgaing stated that you can think of Orange as the \u201cApple\u201d of Africa\u2019s telecommunications world and MTN as the \u201cGoogle.\u201d\nConnecting mobile subscribers to local content creators\nStarNews boasts an active subscriber base of over 4 million through its partnerships with MTN and Orange across six markets (it exited South Africa after a misalignment with MTN\u2019s strategy for engaging content creators) and a community featuring more than 120 content creators. This approach has enabled StarNews to organically expand its user base while securing nearly $8 million (including a $900,000 friends and family round, a $2 million seed investment and a $1.8 million extension) funding from an array of U.S., European and African VCs, including Investisseurs & Partenaires (I&P), Snap via its Yellow Accelerator program, LoftyInc Capital, Graph Ventures and Expert Dojo.\nThe platform is structured around channels, with each creator having a dedicated channel. Kamgaing says the company works closely with creators by providing financial support and assisting in content production; additionally, it guides the creators in their digital journey, offering support in digital acquisition. As previously highlighted, a significant portion of the company\u2019s user acquisition comes through telecom operators, as it\u2019s a seamless process for, say, MTN to send messages encouraging its customers to sign up to Star News to watch social media personalities, including music artists, comedians and influencers. For users, the sign-up process is streamlined for convenience, followed by a straightforward payment mechanism, allowing them to pay using their airtime; this works across six different networks, each offering users various bundles, weekly subscriptions and daily plans.\nIn addition to content produced by creators, StarNews features deeply hyperlocal content, spanning topics such as motorbike taxis in Cameroon or food recipes in Ivory Coast. The platform also hosts genre-specific shows, including the footballing competition African Cup of Nations and a program modeled after a singing reality competition, The Voice. StarNews leverages its partnerships with telecom operators to raise awareness and significantly boost user activations for these shows. For instance, in the 2021 edition of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON), the platform actively produced exclusive content straight from the event, resulting in the acquisition of 600,000 new users. Furthermore, the company sponsors concerts, and at one point, it attracted an impressive 500,000 subscribers by offering them the chance to attend a Fally Ipupa concert.\nThese initiatives highlight the power of strong partnerships, where telcos take the lead, followed by content creators or show organizers, Kamgaing, an ex-PwC consultant, remarked. According to him, this dynamic results in an influx of eager users to access the content or engage with the telco\u2019s activities while positioning StarNews remarkably well to oversee content distribution, monetization, and creation effectively.\n\u201cProduction without distribution is tough and tougher without monetization. There are a lot of people creating content, but they\u2019ll put it on YouTube and Instagram, platforms that control the distribution. There\u2019s no real monetization. We\u2019re able to have all three layers at the local level. We have offices in all the markets and the teams there are specifically working with creators on content production, which is unique,\u201d said the chief executive, while adding that the platform\u2019s content spectrum has expanded to establish significant partnerships with the likes of Sony and Universal in the region.\nOpportunity in Africa\u2019s creator economy sector\nAmong its markets, StarNews has observed the most impressive retention rate in Nigeria, a market that exhibits all the right metrics for exponential growth, according to Kamgaing. Acquiring users is relatively straightforward, and the platform enjoys strong user engagement and stickiness; moreover, monetization is thriving, he said. StarNews employs an internal metric to gauge monetization, known as the billing rate. This metric represents the number of individuals who have sufficient available airtime to pay for digital services; notably, the billing rate is three times higher in Nigeria compared to the Francophone markets.\nKamgaing revealed that the platform distributed $1 million to content creators last year while maintaining an average monthly payout of around $70,000 to these creators. The fresh injection of capital serves as a significant uplift for Africa\u2019s creator economy, an underserved sector in African tech (despite that startups like e-commerce-focused Selar are holding their own). This funding will equip the Los Angeles-based company, currently with 40 employees, to better support its creators and gradually enhance payouts in the coming years, a crucial step in bolstering the region\u2019s creative industry.\nAdditionally, in a press statement, Kamgaing outlined the startup\u2019s expansion plans, noting its intent to strengthen its dominant presence in Francophone Africa while quickly expanding across strategic markets like Nigeria and Ghana. StarNews is looking to be in 11 markets by next year, the chief executive remarked on the call.\nJanngo Capital, an Africa-focused venture capital firm, led the pre-Series A funding round. Other notable investors, such as soccer players Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni of Real Madrid, Jules Kound\u00e9 of Barcelona and Mike Maignan from AC Milan, all affiliated with athlete representation agency Excellence Sport Nation, participated in the round. Kamgaing, in the interview, highlighted the shared African heritage of these players, underscoring their connection to StarNews\u2019 mission and their genuine interest in engaging with the African audience and investing in startups across the continent. These French soccer players now join the ranks of investors like Blaise Matuidi, a former French international who has previously invested in Sudanese fintech company Bloom and currently heads Origins, a VC firm in collaboration with other soccer players who serve as limited partners.\nFatoumata B\u00e2, founder and executive chair of Janngo Capital, affirmed the firm\u2019s support for StarNews, accentuating the platform\u2019s unique positioning, strategic partnerships, technology and content. This support is rooted in the belief that StarNews is well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth potential of Africa\u2019s creative industry, which is poised for a fourfold expansion by 2050 and the possibility to generate up to $20 billion in GDP, she said.\n\u201cI am very excited and proud to back StarNews, the first media platform that supports African creators and tells the world the real African story,\u201d added Fernand Tchouameni, spokesperson and investment advisor for Aurelien Tchouameni. \u201cBeing of Cameroonian descent, I can also see StarNews becoming a bridge to connect with the African diaspora, and I personally look forward to being on it.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Tage Kene-Okafor, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":456}
{"title":"EU commissioner sidesteps MEPs\u2019 questions about CSAM microtargeting","context":"## EU commissioner sidesteps MEPs\u2019 questions about CSAM microtargeting\n\nThe European Union\u2019s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, has confirmed the Commission is investigating whether or not it broke recently updated digital governance rules when her department ran a microtargeted political ad campaign aiming to drive support for a controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM)-scanning proposal she\u2019s spearheading.\nBut at a committee hearing in the European Parliament today she deflected MEPs\u2019 enquiries for her to give more details about the ad campaign.\nThe governance regulation concerned is the Digital Services Act (DSA), which includes provisions relating to online advertising \u2014 including a prohibition on the use of sensitive personal data, such as political opinions, for targeting ads. While the ads in question ran on X (formerly Twitter) \u2014 which is already expected to be compliant with the DSA, having been designated by the Commission as a so-called Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) back in April.\nThe Commission itself, meanwhile, not only proposed this pan-EU law but is responsible for oversight of VLOPs\u2019 DSA compliance. So \u2014 tl;dr \u2014 if EU officials have used X\u2019s ad-targeting tools to break the bloc\u2019s own digital rulebook it\u2019s the very definition of an awkward situation.\nThe existence of the Commission\u2019s microtargeted ad campaign seeking to drum up support for its proposed CSAM-scanning law was spotted last month by technologist, Danny Meki\u0107. An article with his findings ran in Dutch newspaper, De Volkskrant, earlier this month.\nUsing public ad transparency tools the DSA requires VLOPs to provide, Meki\u0107 found the Commission had run a paid advertising campaign on X, targeting users in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal and the Czech Republic \u2014 countries that were not supportive of Johansson\u2019s CSAM-scanning proposal according to leaked minutes from a September 14 meeting of the European Council, a co-legislative body that\u2019s involved (along with MEPs) in determining the final shape of the CSAM law.\nPer Meki\u0107, the Commission\u2019s ad campaign, which apparently racked up millions of views on X, insinuated that opponents of the proposed legislation did not want to protect children \u2014 messaging he dubbed \u201ca form of emotional blackmail\u201d.\nThe ads included what he suggested is a misleading claim that the majority of Europeans support the proposal \u2014 but which is based on a survey that highlighted \u201conly the benefits but not the drawbacks of the proposed legislation\u201d. Other surveys, by research firms YouGov and Novus, that highlighted the drawbacks showed \u201cvirtually no support\u201d for the plan among the European population, his post also pointed out.\nGoing into more detail of the microtargeting used by the Commission, Meki\u0107 wrote: \u201cX\u2019s Transparency Report shows that the European Commission also used \u2018microtargeting\u2019 to ensure that the ads did not appear to people who care about privacy (people interested in Julian Assange) and eurosceptics (people interested in \u2018nexit\u2019, \u2018brexit\u2019 and \u2018spanexit\u2019 or in Victor Orb\u00e1n, Nigel Farage, or the German political party AfD). For unclear reasons, people interested in Christianity were also excluded.\n\u201cAfter excluding critical political and religious groups, X\u2019s algorithm was set to find people in the remaining population who were indeed interested in the ad message, resulting in an uncritical echo chamber. This microtargeting on political and religious beliefs violates X\u2019s advertising policy, the Digital Services Act \u2013 which the Commission itself has to oversee \u2014 and the General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR].\u201d\nDuring an exchange of views with the European Parliament\u2019s civil rights, justice and home affairs (LIBE) committee this afternoon, Johansson admitted the EU\u2019s executive is investigating the matter.\nInitially she had sought to dismiss criticism over the legality of the microtargeting \u2014 claiming in a tweet earlier this month (embedded below) that the campaign was \u201c100%\u201d legal.\nAsked by the LIBE committee about the discrepancy between her tweet and the existence of an investigation Johansson said she had been given \u201cnew information\u201d related to DSA compliance that merited looking into.\nAs my services have been directly accused of illegal acts\ud83d\udc47 I think it is import I step in:\n1. @EUHomeAffairs have followed the guidelines & the law 100%\n2. The promotion of our proposal is standard normal practice\n3. This proposal is about protecting children from sexual abuse https:\/\/t.co\/zSSAu3684P \u2014 Ylva Johansson (@YlvaJohansson) October 13, 2023\n\u201cWhen I made a tweet on the 100% legal [point] that was based on the information I had. But I have to be very open; then I got other information that there could be question marks on the compliance with the DSA \u2014 and I take this very seriously,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cIf that is the case then of course there has to be consequences on that. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we have to look into [it]. Of course we always have to comply with the regulation. There\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\nThe LIBE committee repeatedly pressed Johansson to provide detailed about the microtargeted ad campaign \u2014 but she declined to do so, saying she did not have any information about it and that it was for her \u201cservice\u201d, who she suggested had been responsible for the campaign, to answer. So there was no explanation about why, for instance, Christians had been explicitly excluded from the Commission\u2019s microtargeting.\nShe also avoided giving a direct response to accusations by MEPs that the use of political microtargeting by the Commission was anti-democratic \u2014 opting instead to mount a general defence of its right to promote its proposals. She also listed a number of other departments within the Commission she said had previously used ads to promote separate legislative proposals.\n\u201cI think that the commission should defend and explain and promote our proposals. We do that and we have done that. And I think it\u2019s a good practice to do so. Because we are we are taking stance and we should defend our stance,\u201d she told the committee.\nA number of MEPs pushed back \u2014 including by pointing out that there are more appropriate channels for the Commission to engage directly and transparency with co-legislators than opaque behavioral ad targeting on platforms like Twitter\/X.\n\u201cOne principle of democracy is that we have procedures because the end doesn\u2019t justify the means,\u201d opined MEP Sophie in \u2018t Veld. \u201cAnd European Commission has the right to be very attached to its legislative proposals but there are privileged channels for the European Commission to communicate with the two legislators and others \u2014 not an ad campaign on Twitter.\u201d\nDespite a lot of pushback, the committee was unable to extract any other lines from commissioner on the ad campaign. But at the end of the session she did agree to respond to it in writing with some missing answers \u201cas soon as possible\u201d (albeit, avoiding agreeing to do so by the end of the week, as one MEP had asked).\nCommercial influence\nWhile many of the questions directed at her over the 1.5-hour long hearing focused on the controversy that\u2019s sprung up around the ad campaign, parliamentarians also pressed the commissioner on a number of other issues \u2014 including concerns about the extent of commercial lobbying around the CSAM-scanning proposal.\nThis has been a topic of intense interest, especially following a report by investigative journalists published last month by BalkanInsight which looked at close contacts between Johansson\u2019s department and companies with CSAM-scanning and other child safety tools to sell.\nOne of the journalists involved in that investigation, Apostolis Fotiadis, had also been invited by the committee to participate in the exchange of views \u2014 and he took the opportunity to defend their reporting from direct public attacks by Johansson.\nIn a blog post ahead of today\u2019s hearing \u2014 which deploys a crisis-PR-esque headline claim of \u201csetting the record straight\u201d \u2014 she criticized the article as \u201ca series of insinuations looking for a home\u201d; claiming it paired an outline of \u201ca selection of meetings I had, of events I attended, or conferences I addressed\u201d with \u201ca conspiratorial tone\u201d in an attempt \u201cto create the impression of financial influence where there is none\u201d.\nFotiadis was asked by the LIBE committee about the accusation that the journalists had, essentially, been spreading disinformation \u2014 and specifically whether he believed Johansson and the Commission\u2019s response to it amounted to a restriction on media freedom. He responded by saying he did not think that was the case. But went on to express surprise at how the Commission had reacted to the scrutiny \u2014 to its instinct to deploy \u201cspin-doctor\u201d tactics to try to discredit the article, rather than engaging with the substance of the concerns being raised.\nThe Commission risks straying close to making attacks on journalists by using such tactics, Fotiadis warned \u2014 adding: \u201cYou cannot just dismiss everything by calling fake news\u201d \u2014 before also noting that Johansson\u2019s office had declined multiple interview requests ahead of publication of the article.\nResponding to a question from the committee about the reporting he said documents obtained by the journalists included email threads between Commission officials in Johansson\u2019s department, DG-Home, and a \u201ckey stakeholder\u201d advocating for the use of technology for CSAM-scanning \u2014 which indicated what he described as \u201cprivileged access\u201d that \u201cspeaks directly to cooperation\u201d and goes \u201cway beyond\u201d mere consultation or exchange of views on the proposal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an official chain discussing invitation, how the stakeholder would be able to allocate experts that would speak in workshops \u2014 first attended by representatives of the Member States, and then afterwards actually by ministers in the Council in a meeting chaired by commissioner Johansson. So when we say facilitate, it\u2019s obvious that the EU officials discuss what kind of experts will be available from this particular stakeholder to attend these meetings and to present the point of view, which seems to be a privileged access,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cAlso in the same email thread there\u2019s mention of EU officials being allocated to specifically attend the cooperation between the stakeholder and DG-Home on the proposal, which to our understanding is something that goes way beyond the level of consultations or exchange of views or exchange of opinions on the proposal and speaks directly to cooperation.\u201d\nThe committee took the opportunity to press Johansson about her contacts with companies and other lobbyists during the drafting of the CSAM-proposal, with MEPs saying they want clear answers to the allegations of commercial interest and heavy lobbying when the Commission was setting up and drafting the proposal.\nIn the event MEPs got some bare bones detail.\nAsked for a list of these contacts, the commissioner responded that she\u2019d met with Google six times; Microsoft, Meta and TikTok three times each; twice with Twitter (X); and once apiece with Apple and Amazon. She also said she\u2019d met with the child safety organizations Thorn (twice) and Brave Movement (twice); and with Tech Alliance and ICANN once apiece.\nIn wider responses related to concerns about how much commercial interest had influenced the Commission, Johansson highlighted her decision for the CSAM-scanning proposal to be \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d \u2014 meaning the draft regulation does not support any specific tech solution \u2014 with the suggestion being EU lawmakers had resisted lobbying by companies for a law that would explicitly favor their existing tech tools.\nShe also denied that only Thorn and Microsoft have technology \u201cthat is necessary for the scanning\u201d \u2014 claiming that\u2019s \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d.\n\u201cThere are no specific technologies mentioned [in the proposal] and I think this is an important part. So there\u2019s no specific technology that\u2019s been favoured in this proposal,\u201d she also told the committee, adding: \u201cSo many technologies are being developed all the time \u2014 while we are speaking \u2014 and they will continue to develop. So I think it\u2019s important that the legislation has to be technology neutral.\u201d\nEarlier this week a seminar organized by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), an advisory body to the Commission on data protection law, heard from more than 20 speakers across civil society, academia and industry expressing deep misgivings about the Commission\u2019s approach \u2014 including a warning from the EDPS himself that the EU could be at a tipping point for freedom and democracy if it does not turn back from the plan to do non-targeted scanning of private messages.\nJohansson had been invited to participate in the seminar but declined to attend. She didn\u2019t offer a direct response to the EDPS\u2019 concerns today but she did counter a number of arguments heard at the session earlier in the week \u2014 including refuting the suggestion that her proposal amounts to mass surveillance.\n\u201cMy proposal would not mean that all communication will be scanned. Compared to the situation today it will be much more limited,\u201d she claimed, referencing the temporary ePrivacy derogation that currently gives messaging firms a legal basis to scan non-encrypted content for CSAM (but is intended to be replaced by the proposed regulation which, critics contend, will force platforms to scan end-to-end encrypted content too). \u201cToday companies are allowed to scan if they search for child sexual abuse material. That\u2019s why we receive these 5.2 million videos and pictures and grooming attempts \u2014 70% from private communication. If my proposal is adopted, this will be limited.\u201d\nShe also emphasized how the proposal first requires in-scope platforms to deploy prevention measures to try to stop the spread of CSAM and\/or prevent abuse of their tools by people intent on abusing children. \u201cFirst comes prevention. Only if prevention is not enough, then you might be allowed to do detection \u2014 but only after a court decision,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo only those that really cannot deal with the problem with mitigating measures\u2026 and only after a court decision and only during a specific period they will be allowed to do the detection,\u201d she went on. \u201cWe will also limit the reporting so that we will also receive fewer but hopefully better reports.\u201d\nJohansson\u2019s arguments to MEPs that her proposal does not overreach also lent on the existence of other EU laws \u2014 such as the bloc\u2019s data protection framework \u2014 which she suggested will act as balancing checks on the scope of possible CSAM-scanning. \u201cIt\u2019s also important that we continue to comply with all relevant legislation. For example the GDPR and other requirements, there are no derogation from that in my proposal,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important \u2014 and I know that\u2019s been part of the debate \u2014 that it should not be a slippery slope,\u201d she added. \u201cThe proposal specifically prohibits using the detection technologies for any other purpose than the detection of child sexual abuse online \u2014 and only with verified indicators of child sexual abuse provided by the EU Centre.\u201d\nGiven her reliance on pointing to the existence of a wider EU legal framework doing the heavy lifting and protecting Europeans\u2019 fundamental rights as a strategy to assuage critics, and given she\u2019s also invoking respect for the rule of law as a buttress against the risk of content-scanning mission creep, it\u2019s doubly relevant that the Commission now finds itself in a bind \u2014 forced to investigate whether its own officials ignored legal requirements in a bid to covertly sweep past critics.\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-25 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":457}
{"title":"10 Minute School aims to democratize education for Bangladeshi students","context":"## 10 Minute School aims to democratize education for Bangladeshi students\n\nAccess to education in Bangladesh is filled with inequalities, say the founders of edtech 10 Minute School. Many rural areas don\u2019t have good learning centers and as a result, students travel to capital Dhaka to prepare for their university admission exams. That option, however, is only available to families who have the financial means.\nOriginally created as a YouTube channel, 10 Minute School (shortened to 10MS) wants to democratize access to supplementary education for K12 students throughout the country. The startup, which says it is the largest edtech company in Bangladesh, announced today it has raised a pre-Series A of $5.5 million, the highest seed-stage funding so far for a Bangladeshi startup. This brings 10MS total raised to $7.5 million.\n10MS offers live-streamed classes for K12 students, pre-recorded lessons, university admission test prep and personalized quizzes, among other content, that can be accessed through a smartphone app. So far, it has 35,000 recorded video lessons and over 82,000 quizzes, along with resources like model tests, ebooks and lecture notes that cover the entire national curriculum. 52% of its students are from rural and semi-urban areas outside of Dhaka, and 34% are girls (one of 10MS\u2019s goals is to address gender inequalities in education).\nThe company\u2019s new round comes from a combination of private and government investors. The funding was led by Conjunction Capital, with participation from returning investor Peak XV\u2019s Surge (formerly Sequoia Capital India), the Bangladesh government\u2019s sovereign venture fund, Startup Bangladesh Limited, CRED founder and CEO Kunal Shah, MyAsiaVC managing partner Sajid Rahman and several local angel investors.\nCo-founder Ayman Sadiq started 10MS as a YouTube channel in 2015. Sadiq, who has taught since 2012, was previously a teacher at a leading coaching center in Dhaka. During that time, he realized many of his students faced two obstacles: the cost of tuition and of traveling to Dhaka from their hometowns, which didn\u2019t have coaching centers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the naive idea came into being that I could record all the videos and upload them onto YouTube for free, so no one needed to come to the capital city and no one needed to pay anything,\u201d Sadiq says. He was also heavily inspired by online learning platforms like Khan Academy and edX. After hitting a following of 100,000 people on YouTube, Sadiq said he realized the idea was scalable.\nBetween 2015 and 2019, the YouTube channel took on sponsors, including telecom operators, electronics companies and FMCG brands, and produced more than 25,000 videos covering the entire K12 syllabus. Then the pandemic hit and sponsors began dropping out. Sadiq realized that in order to make his project sustainable, he would have to create a paid version. So 10MS produced its first premium product, a paid book and course.\n\u201cInterestingly, that paid book and course individually had more than 100,000 paid users,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that instantly gave us an idea of, okay, we can actually monetize some of our offerings and solutions and make a sustainable business out of it.\u201d\nThe fledging company started looking for investors, and in 2022, it raised $2 million in seed funding led by Surge, Sequoia India\u2019s (now Peak XV) scale-up program.\nNow that 10MS has raised its pre-Series A, it plans to invest in its tech capabilities, content and operations, says co-founder and COO Mirza Salman Hossain Beg. He added that 10MS\u2019 goal is to provide personalized learning experiences for students by using AI and it will bring in more engineers and product managers to support its tech development.\nAnother major area of investment for 10MS is content that fits with Bangladesh\u2019s evolving K12 curriculum. \u201cThe government in Bangladesh right now is going through a lot of massive changes in the national curriculum, and as a result of that, there will be a lot of new content to be created to support the new curriculum,\u201d Beg says.\n10MS is also currently exploring a hybrid online\/offline model, with centers for after school education, and creating a new vertical for its English material by building a separate sales team.\nInterestingly enough, the last Bangladesh startup to raise the highest seed-stage funding in the country was also an edtech. Shikho, which focuses on elementary school learners, raised a total of $5.3 million in seed funding as of March 2022. Shikho is one of 10MS\u2019s competitors, but Beg says 10MS has the advantage of being older and larger, and teaching a wider range of grades.\nWhen asked what\u2019s driving interest in edtech in Bangladesh, Beg said the country\u2019s educational system faces many challenges. \u201cWe have a huge student base of 42 million enrolled in the K12 system and the majority of students don\u2019t have access to quality teachers, quality content, because those who are actually living outside the capital city don\u2019t have good teachers in their area,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental problem that needs to be solved is access to quality content and teachers in a very affordable manner.\u201d Edtech has the opportunity to democratize access to education, reaching students on their phones wherever they are.\nIn an investor quote, Conjunction Capital managing partner Kirill Kozhevnikov said, \u201cThis marks our first venture into the Bangladesh market, and we are confident that this partnership will redefine the education landscape in the country.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Catherine Shu, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-12 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":458}
{"title":"'We know far more about the deep ocean than the moon or Mars,' says explorer Jon Copley","context":"## 'We know far more about the deep ocean than the moon or Mars,' says explorer Jon Copley\n\nThe deep sea has become a \"realm of myth and darkness,\" says ocean explorer Jon Copley. (Image credit: inusuke via Getty Images)\nOcean explorer Jon Copley has completed dozens of dives to the darkest corners of the deep sea. Yet he is still amazed every time he encounters the strange life forms that thrive there. Over the past 25 years, Copley has traveled to the world's deepest hydrothermal vents , to Antarctica's icy \"midnight zone\" and to spectacular undersea mountain chains across the planet.\nAs a professor of ocean exploration and science communication at the University of Southampton in the U.K., Copley dedicates much of his time to addressing the myriad questions and myths surrounding the deep sea. His new book \"Deep Sea: 10 Things You Should Know\" (Orion Publishing, 2023) takes a fascinating look at some of the harshest habitats on Earth.\nIn a video interview with Live Science, Copley described the latest discoveries and where deep sea research is heading in a warming world.\nSascha Pare: Four years ago, when I was a student sitting in your deep sea ecology lectures, you had just published your first book, \"Ask an Ocean Explorer\" (Hodder & Stoughton, 2019). That book had 25 chapters, each answering a question that people commonly ask you as a deep sea biologist. What did you set out to do in \"Deep Sea: 10 Things You Should Know\"?\nRelated: Bizarre, alien-like creature discovered deep in Atlantic Ocean has 20 gangly arms\nJon Copley: This new book answers the top 10 questions that I know people have about the deep sea and also tackles some of the myths and popular misconceptions that we sometimes hear. The shorter format is an opportunity to focus and update the information \u2014 there have been quite a few discoveries in lots of different aspects of deep sea biology since I wrote \"Ask an Ocean Explorer.\"\nWe know far more about the deep ocean and its inhabitants than about the moon or Mars, says Jon Copley. (Image credit: Giordano Cipriani via Getty Images)\nSP: Research has made great strides in recent years, I'm sure. What are some of the most exciting, new discoveries you discuss in the book?\nJC: We're finding out a lot more about how deep sea animals interact with each other and their environment. An area where we've seen a lot of interesting papers over the past five years has been in sensory ecology \u2014 realizing how animals perceive their environment, how they respond to that, how they avoid being seen by predators... It was nice to bring some of those together in a couple of the chapters.\nSP: Some of the chapters focus on dispelling misconceptions people might have about what's down there in the ocean. What, to your mind, is the biggest, most pervasive myth about the deep sea?\nJC: It's the idea that we know almost nothing about it. There's this very popular idea that we know more about the moon or Mars than the deep ocean. That's only really true for one very specific aspect of knowledge \u2014 having a detailed map of the terrain of its solid surface \u2014 because the moon and Mars are not covered in seawater, which blocks radar and means we have to use sonar in the deep ocean. Apart from that, we know far more about the deep ocean than those other places.\nSP: The deep sea has attracted a lot of attention recently in the advent of deep sea mining . How worried are you about that?\nJC: I think it's great that deep sea mining has made people care more about the deep ocean, but it hasn't actually started yet and research does not support some of the more hyperbolic headlines.\nRelated: More than 5,000 new species found in 'pristine' deep-sea wilderness. But they could soon be wiped out.\nThere's a lot of research focused on how we're going to manage mining, if it does go ahead. And there are some habitat types in the deep ocean that we don't need to do further research on, because we know they are so vulnerable. We know that we would risk species extinction at active hydrothermal vents, for example, because they're a tiny habitat globally \u2014 just 50 square kilometers [19 square miles] \u2014 with more than 400 animal species not found in any other habitat type. But I'm confident that we will see protection for active hydrothermal vents, because we scientists have been saying that for years.\nHydrothermal vents are some of the most vulnerable deep sea habitats and home to 400 animal species not found anywhere else. (Image credit: Universal History Archive\/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nSP: Deep sea mining is perhaps more manageable in terms of its impacts than other human activities. If not mining, what is the biggest human threat to the deep sea?\nJC: To my mind, it's climate change . And it affects the deep ocean in lots of different ways. The one that concerns me particularly is deoxygenation \u2014 the reduction in oxygen levels \u2014 because deep sea animals need oxygen and they get it from the seawater.\nOxygen is carried down by currents that form in the polar regions and sink and spread throughout the deep ocean. As a result of climate change, the ocean is getting warmer and that means it can't carry as much dissolved oxygen . When water is warmer, the metabolism of things living in the water runs faster and they use up oxygen more quickly, so that makes the problem even worse. And thirdly, we know that the currents carrying oxygen down to the deep ocean are weakening , because melting ice sheets are making the water fresher and blocking the formation of dense water than sinks.\nThose currents take centuries to complete their journey, which means the changes we have already made are going to carry on being felt for centuries. The deep ocean is already on track to have 10% less oxygen overall globally than it did in preindustrial times by 2400. It's hard to predict what the knock-on effects are going to be, but they are going to be widespread and they are coming.\nSP: You dedicate much of your time to communicating deep sea science with lay audiences. Why is that so important to you?\nJC: I enjoy talking to people about the deep sea because it's not somewhere we think about every day. We can go out at night and if we look at the sky, we might wonder about what's going on up there. But you can't glance into the deep sea in the same way, so it has become a realm of myth and darkness. Even the names of the deepest bits of the deep sea \u2014 the abyssal plains and the hadal zone \u2014 evoke that kind of underworld. It's nice to be able to shine a light on that for people and to highlight how our lives are connected to it.\nThe deep sea and the names we give some its features evoke \"some kind of underworld,\" says Jon Copley. (Image credit: A. Martin UW Photography via Getty Images)\nSP: Speaking of the sky, how does exploring the deep ocean inform the search for life outside our solar system ?\nJC: Deep sea exploration has shown us that the range of conditions under which life can thrive is far greater than we imagined. The idea that chemosynthesis \u2014 where life is powered by a form of chemical energy instead of sunlight with photosynthesis \u2014 could sustain whole populations of animal species was impossible, until we discovered hydrothermal vents and other, similar habitats.\nDeep sea vents also glow very faintly \u2014 too faintly for the human eye to see, but bright enough that microbes can use it as an energy source. Again, it expands our notion of what's possible in the cosmos, because you don't necessarily have to be that close to a bright star, potentially, to sustain life.\n\"Deep Sea: 10 Things You Should Know\" is available in the U.K. to order on Amazon .\nThis interview has been condensed and lightly edited for length.\nDeep sea creatures have evolved extreme strategies to cope with their environment.
