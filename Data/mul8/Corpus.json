{"title":"Beeper reversed engineered iMessage to bring blue bubble texts to Android users","context":"## Beeper reversed engineered iMessage to bring blue bubble texts to Android users\n\nThe push to bring iMessage to Android users today adds a new contender. A startup called Beeper, which had been working on a multi-platform messaging aggregator, is now launching a new app called Beeper Mini which will allow Android users to send and receive end-to-end encrypted iMessage chats for just $1.99 per month. Beeper Mini was made possible because the team behind the app has managed to reverse-engineer the iMessage protocol, they say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big breakthrough,\u201d explains Beeper co-founder and CEO Eric Migicovsky, previously the founder of smartwatch startup Pebble. \u201cWe\u2019re not actually a middleman anymore. The research that we\u2019ve done is actually reverse-engineering the iMessage protocol, down to the lowest layer of the protocol. So Beeper Mini doesn\u2019t use a Mac server as a relay like all the other apps \u2014 they have a Mac Mini in a data center somewhere. And when you send a message, you\u2019re actually sending a message to the Mac Mini, which then forwards it to iMessage,\u201d he explains. \u201cBeeper Mini is a native implementation of the iMessage protocol.\u201d\nBeeper does not have access to the contents of users\u2019 messages, the company claims. And unlike the recently paused efforts by Sunbird, which had been trying to solve the same problem, messages are not sent in clear text.\nInstead, the message you send from an Android phone using Beeper Mini is end-to-end encrypted to the recipient, the startup says. It\u2019s encrypted on the device before it leaves the app. Encryption keys are exclusively stored on your phone within the Android filesystem, similar to other apps like Signal and WhatsApp. The app doesn\u2019t connect to any servers at Beeper itself, only to Apple servers, the way a \u201creal\u201d iMessage text would.\nThat means that Beeper Mini can function as a true iMessage client, supporting high-resolution photos and videos, threads, replies, read receipts, direct messages and group chats, tapback emoji reactions, editing and unsending messages, as well as support for stickers, GIFs, voice notes and more. Not yet supported are features like live location sharing, message effects and support for FaceTime audio and video calls. Users will not need an Apple ID to use Beeper Mini.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a full-blown iMessage app,\u201d Migicovsky says. \u201cFor all intents and purposes, Beeper Mini looks like an iPhone [sent it].\u201d\nApple, then, may not be able to simply block Beeper Mini texts automatically if it wanted to take action against the company, though the co-founder admits how Apple will react is still uncertain.\nHowever, he points to a provision in copyright law, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA 1201 F), which says that reverse-engineering for the purposes of interoperability is protected. That won\u2019t necessarily prevent Apple from sending Beeper legal a Cease and Desist, of course. Apple previously sued spyware maker NSO Group to block it from using Apple\u2019s services, and it could likely make a legal case here, as well, if it chose to. What may hold it at bay is the Digital Markets App (DMA), a law in Europe that says big tech companies will have to have an interoperable interface for their chat networks. There are also stirrings of antitrust efforts in the U.S., where Apple is under federal scrutiny, which could make for bad timing to target Beeper, too.\nBut to be fully trusted, Beeper Mini will need to be audited by a third party \u2014 something it has not yet done. In addition, Beeper uses certificate pinning, which makes network traffic analysis more difficult to perform in order to verify its claims. The company says its external audit is still \u201cin progress\u201d but it has performed an internal audit. The company is publishing those results on its blog along with a detailed, more technical description of how Beeper Mini works.\nFor example, the team explains here how it needed to build a new service, called Beeper Push Notification service (BPNs), to make the service work:\nA persistent connection to APNs is needed to be notified of new incoming messages in real-time. On an iPhone, an APNs connection is maintained by the operating system, and connected at all times. In Beeper Mini, the connection can only be maintained when the app is running, since Android does not support APNs natively.\nTo work around this limitation, the team built BPNs to connect to Apple\u2019s servers on the user\u2019s behalf when the app isn\u2019t running.\nIn tests, Beeper Mini worked as described, able to send iMessage texts from an older Android phone on Google Fi\u2019s wireless network with its own phone number (not associated with an Apple ID) to an iPhone 15 Pro Max with a different phone number that is associated with an Apple ID. Full-res photos and other features like tapbacks and typing indicators also worked. When the Android phone\u2019s battery died, however, the texts reverted to green bubbles and did not make it to Beeper\u2019s app \u2014 they went to Google Messages instead.\nThe company is also hoping to gain trust by building in public, with 50-plus projects that it\u2019s published to GitHub with the open source code that goes into the app. Plus, the founders themselves are known individuals with a history of building promising tech, including the Pebble smartwatch.\nFounded in 2020, Beeper comes from former Y Combinator partner Eric Migicovsky and CTO Brad Murray, previously of wholesale marketplace startup Faire and Fitbit. The co-founders met at Pebble, the smartwatch company Migicovsky founded, building out the hardware brand that was later acquired by Fitbit.\nMigicovsky said he was inspired to build Beeper out of a personal need as a lifelong Android user.\nInitially, Beeper launched a multi-network chat app that supported around 15 different networks, including WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, Signal, Slack, Instagram, LinkedIn, Discord, Google Chat, Android SMS, iMessage and others.\n\u201cUntil I started Beeper, I didn\u2019t really understand this whole iMessage thing. I didn\u2019t really understand why people loved it so much,\u201d Migicovsky says. \u201cI think one of the reasons is that it\u2019s so deeply built into iOS, that it\u2019s second nature for you as an iPhone user. When you want to get in touch with someone, you open the Messages app.\u201d\nHis experience with messaging had differed, though, having lived in Europe and Asia at times, where he collected friends across a wider network of applications. He didn\u2019t understand the draw that iMessage had in the U.S. in particular, as he was simply left out of friends\u2019 iMessage chats for being the friend with a green bubble.\nThe original Beeper app had 50,000 sign-ups in the first week and now has around 100,000 testers in a closed beta. That app, which spans mobile and desktop, supports RCS (via Beeper\u2019s open source bridge). Beeper Mini will be able to send and receive SMS and RCS soon. The earlier Beeper will now transition to become rebranded as \u201cBeeper Cloud\u201d as the iMessage-only Beeper Mini goes to launch. Over time, Beeper Mini will add the other networks back into the platform, as well as SMS and RCS, and Beeper Cloud will be sunset. At that point, Beeper Mini will become known as just Beeper once again.\nBeeper Mini is competitively priced at $1.99 per month, with a seven-day free trial, compared with $15 per month for the recently acquired competitor Texts.com bought by Automattic. The startup says that it\u2019s able to keep costs down by targeting a wider market that includes Android, iPhone, Mac, Windows and Linux.\nHowever, Beeper also has venture capital to lean on, with $16 million raised to date through its Series A, led by Garry Tan of Initialized Capital, now president and CEO at Y Combinator. Other backers include SV Angel, Samsung Next, Liquid2 Ventures, Niv Dror from Shrug Capital, Kevin Mahaffey and others. Beeper is a 25-person distributed team, while Migicovsky is based in Palo Alto.\nAsked if Samsung\u2019s investment means the company could be interested in a later acquisition, Migicovsky only responded \u201cno comment.\u201d\n\u201cThey have been very supportive,\u201d he added.\nBeeper Mini is available to the public today on Google Play Store.\nAdditional reporting by Zack Whittaker.\nCorrection, 12\/5\/23, 2:55 PM ET: the price of Beeper Mini was listed incorrectly in one part of the article. It\u2019s $1.99\/mo, not $2.99\/mo; 12\/6\/23, 2:33 PM ET added \u201c[sent it]\u201d to clarify that the Beeper app does not look like an iPhone app.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-05 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":540}

{"title":"Liverpool enjoy home comforts but Dyche\u2019s Everton offer derby danger | Andy Hunter","context":"## Liverpool enjoy home comforts but Dyche\u2019s Everton offer derby danger | Andy Hunter\n\nThree points off the top, three goals scored in every Premier League home game, a 100% record in all competitions at Anfield, cruising through the Europa League group stage and individuals shining; it is fair to say Liverpool have surpassed the pre-season expectations of a new-look team. It is not unreasonable of J\u00fcrgen Klopp, however, to expect much more as the season develops.\n\u201cYou saw so many teams here growing in the direction we wanted and all became better step by step or the manager had to go,\u201d said Klopp on the demands of his particular job. \u201cWe will try together to get better step by step and show our real face more often than not.\u201d\nThe 243rd edition of the most played derby in English football offers an ideal opportunity for Liverpool to grant Klopp\u2019s request given the one-sided nature of the fixture on his watch, regardless of another early kick-off after an international break playing havoc with preparations. Klopp has lost one of his 17 encounters with Everton, Liverpool one of the past 23 Premier League meetings at Anfield and one of the past 25 league derbies home or away.\nLiverpool\u2019s defensive concerns, heightened by the loss of Andy Robertson for up to three months with a shoulder injury, are offset by the visitors\u2019 troubles in front of goal. A 3-0 defeat of Bournemouth last time out was only the eighth time Everton have scored more than once in a Premier League match in the past 12 months. The overall improvement in Everton\u2019s performance, however, coupled with three wins in the past four games, raises Sean Dyche hopes of capitalising on any post-international fatigue in the opposition ranks. Klopp\u2019s compliments towards Dyche and his local rivals were of the back-handed nature.\n\u201cEverton are in a good moment,\u201d he said. \u201cBurnley in their best moments [under Dyche] were a super-difficult team to play against and you can see that again; it\u2019s similar with different players. We have to be ready for second ball fights, runs in behind, a compact defence. It will be a tough one. Burnley games were always tough. We have to have football understanding, patience, put a proper shift in and take the fight.\u201d\nLast time out, Everton beat Bournemouth 3-0 \u2013 only the eighth time in the past 12 months that they have scored more than once in a league game. Photograph: Nigel French\/PA\nWhat Klopp is seeking most of all from Liverpool is consistency throughout the 90-plus minutes of a Premier League game. It was achieved in the commanding 3-0 defeat of an in-form Aston Villa early last month, a performance that carried echoes of Liverpool at their dominant best under Klopp, but other highlights, even in victory, have been interspersed with lapses. The manager believes some instability is inevitable given this summer\u2019s midfield rebuild.\n\u201cYes it is [a factor] but we\u2019ve also changed between games quite a lot because of the amount of games and we\u2019ve been interrupted by international breaks twice now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is a more settled team it doesn\u2019t make that much of a difference because we are much more used to each other and that is not the case yet. As a group we have to become consistent but you do it step by step.\n\u201cIt is not too long ago that we had the problem of performing on a really high level until we didn\u2019t perform at all any more; we were 1-0 or 2-0 up in a game and all of a sudden we came under pressure. Crazy. We had to learn to control the game. It is all the things that happen with time \u2013 there is no shortcut to that. With the signs we showed so far I am absolutely fine but I don\u2019t know the final destination, I can\u2019t even see that yet, but it is not a problem because other teams have similar problems. It is about how quick we can make the steps and that is what we are working on every day but the problem now is how could we work since Brighton [where Liverpool drew 2-2]? We had three, with a goalie, first-team players in training until Wednesday. Tomorrow we have to play with what we did so far but in general you have to gain stability bit by bit.\u201d\nIt has arrived in attack, where Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s influence has improved considerably since his match-winning cameo for the 10 men of Liverpool at Newcastle. Mohamed Salah has scored or assisted in 14 consecutive Premier League matches and Liverpool could emulate their predecessors from 1980-81 by scoring three or more goals in the opening four home league games. Stopping goals has been the problem, with Liverpool conceding first and cheaply on occasions. Klopp insists he has not built another formidable attack at the expense of a resilient defence; it is just another step Liverpool have to make.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Imagine if we kept clean sheets but didn\u2019t create. You have time for these things when you are new [to a club], when things are under average before you come in and you are 14th.

By finding stud production at modest prices, we allow ourselves plenty of remaining budget to afford elite weekly performers at other roster spots. When our studs and our sleepers hit, we usually win.\nWe do all the leg work for you -- poring over the player pools, like my daughter searching the Target Christmas catalog \u2014 then we handpick the most promising sleepers and tell you why they're worth drafting to your next DFS squad. All you have to do is choose your favorites, sit back, and relax.\nWEEK 15 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nIf daily fantasy was as easy as picking all top-end skill-position players from one week to the next, it would be a lot easier to win the milli-maker. Let's face it, in order to win big, we need to hit on some diamonds in the rough, and in order to afford a CeeDee Lamb ($9,200 on DK), we have to invest in the occasional Demarcus Robinson ($3,600).\nWe have enjoyed consistent success with our DFS sleepers and values all season. Each Tuesday, we share a big list of our hits from the previous week. \u2014 with each hit typically netting at least 16-22 fantasy points. Throughout the year, we've been consistently ahead of the game on breakouts like Puka Nacua, Kyren Williams, and Tank Dell, among many others.\nTake a look at our collection of hits from last week:\nPos. Player Wk. 14 Game DK Price Pts QB Baker Mayfield Buccaneers at Falcons $5,300 20.1 QB Russell Wilson Broncos at Chargers $5,800 19.5 QB Gardner Minshew Colts at Bengals $5,400 16.1 RB Joe Mixon Bengals vs. Colts $6,100 21.5 RB Javonte Williams Broncos at Chargers $5,800 18.1 WR Garrett Wilson Jets vs. Texans $5,500 23.1 WR Rashee Rice Chiefs vs. Bills $5,400 19.2 WR Courtland Sutton Broncos at Chargers $6,100 15.2 TE Isaiah Likely Ravens vs. Rams $3,500 19.3 DST Cleveland Browns vs. Jaguars $3,000 12.0\nNow that's what we call a strong week! We averaged over 19 DK points per position player and 18.4 per position while spending just under $5,200 per pick. Rostering that kind of cheap production allowed us to find consistent weekly studs at other positions while setting us apart from the pack through lineup variance.\nWin BIG with SuperDraft! Get a free $10 deposit when you use promo code \"TSN\"!\nLet's shower, rinse, repeat! This year, we're also incorporating SuperDraft into our weekly DFS column. For those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. So, the sleepers who carry lower salaries in DK\/FD have higher boosts on SD. The best part: SuperDraft users can roster any player with no restrictions.\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS: How to play SuperDraft\nNow, to our picks. Below we will reveal our Week 15 DFS sleepers and values at each position. Good luck, have fun, and enjoy what will undoubtedly be another wild week!\nAll player values are from DraftKings, FanDuel, and SuperDraft. All stats are from NFL.com and Pro Football Reference.\nNFL DFS Picks Week 15: QB sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft\nBrock Purdy, 49ers at Cardinals (DK: $6,800 | FD: $8,400 | SD: 1.2x)\nWe usually don't feature players with salaries higher than $6,200 on DK and $8,000 on FD, but $6,800 on DK just seems like a massive value for the MVP frontrunner. Purdy has been scorching, with 57.9 DK points over San Francisco's past two games and at least 23.8 in five of the Niners' past six. The Cards rank among the 10 most generous defenses to QBs on DK, so we're all over the young gunslinger in the desert this weekend.\nJordan Love, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $6,200 | FD: $8,000 | SD: 1.25x)\nLove and the Packers' pass-catchers have emerged as legit offensive threats over the past month, finally easing the Cheeseheads' anguish over the departure of Aaron Rodgers. Cult hero Tommy DeVito hit the pause button on Green Bay's good times, but it should start rolling again this weekend at home against a miserable Tampa Bay secondary. The Bucs have surrendered the fourth-most FD points and fifth-most DK points to QBs this season, and Plodmaster General AJ Dillon ain't about to crack their strong front-seven. We love Love this weekend, and not just because we're lovers at heart.\nOther solid Week 15 values: Matthew Stafford, Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $6,000 | FD: $7,200 | SD: 1.3x); Derek Carr, Saints vs. Giants (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x); Joe Flacco, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $5,500 | FD: $7,100 | SD: 1.35x); Will Levis, Titans vs. Texans (DK: $5,400 | FD: $6,800 | SD: 1.35x)\nWEEK 15 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nNFL DFS Picks Week 15: RB sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft\nDevin Singletary, Texans at Titans (DK: $5,400 | FD: $6,000 | SD: 1.35x)\nWith C.J. Stroud in the league's concussion protocol and Nico Collins (calf) joining Tank Dell (fibula) on the Texans' injury list, Houston suddenly finds itself without many impact skill-position players. Singletary, however, has been pretty damn good and showed us last week that he's the main man over Dameon Pierce in DeMeco Ryans' backfield. He had 13 carries for 65 yards and a TD against the Jets, while Pierce totaled just five touches for seven yards. Don't be scared of Tennessee's run D because it ain't what it used to be under Mike Vrabel. Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane just posted 35.1 PPR points against the Titans, Chuba Hubbard had 20.2 a few weeks ago, and Rachaad White had 17.8 against them in Week 10.\nAntonio Gibson, Commanders at Rams (DK: $5,200 | FD: $5,600 | SD: 1.4x)\nAaron Donald and friends will be attacking the pocket early and often in pursuit of Sam Howell, who has been sacked 10 more times than any other QB. Dump-offs and screens will be plentiful for Gibson, who comes at a major discount, at least in PPR formats.\nMore solid Week 15 RB values: Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots vs. Chiefs (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x); Jerick McKinnon, Chiefs at Patriots (DK: $5,100 | FD: $5,500 | SD: 1.45x); Jordan Mason, 49ers at Cardinals (DK: $4,600 | FD: $4,200 | SD: 1.6x); Tyler Allgeier, Falcons at Panthers (DK: $4,400 | FD: $5,700 | SD: 1.6x)\nWEEK 15 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nNFL DFS Picks Week 15: WR sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft\nRashee Rice, Chiefs at Patriots (DK: $6,100 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x)\nWith Isiah Pacheco (shoulder) banged up, Rice seems like Kansas City's best skill-position player this side of Travis Kelce. He's certainly the most sure-handed wideout on the Chiefs (not saying much, but still), and he has electric after-the-catch playmaking ability (which is good, considering Patrick Mahomes has struggled with deep-ball accuracy). The rookie has quietly posted 57.3 PPR points over the past three weeks! Since Bill Belichick's defense typically makes it a point to neutralize the opposition's top threat, which is obviously Kelce this weekend, look for Rice to bust some chunk-yard plays through the screen game and dump-downs.\nRomeo Doubs, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $5,300 | FD: $6,400 | SD: 1.45x)\nDoubs has been one of the more dependable offensive weapons in Green Bay's offense, and Tampa Bay's secondary has been utterly abysmal all season, so we're rolling with the young wideout in a handful of lineups this weekend. Doubs has a good floor, logging 11-plus DK points eight times, and a decent ceiling (at least 18.3 three times). Fire him up in what should be a pass-heavy matchup at Lambeau.\nDemarcus Robinson, Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $3,600 | FD: $5,600 | SD: 1.7x)\nRobinson has become one of Matthew Stafford's most trusted receivers, drawing a 21.8-percent target share over the past two weeks. And the veteran has made the most of his opportunities, collecting seven catches for 101 yards and two TDs during that span. The Commanders are terrible at defending the pass \u2014 even worse than they were earlier in the season since they shipped out multiple impact pass-rushers. Washington has surrendered the most FanDuel points and second-most DraftKings points to wide receivers this season. Run DMC into your DFS lineups this weekend.\nMore solid Week 15 WR values: Amari Cooper, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $6,000 | FD: $7,200 | SD: 1.35x); Garrett Wilson, Jets at Dolphins (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,900 | SD: 1.4x); Brandin Cooks, Cowboys at Bills (DK: $5,200 | FD: $6,300 | SD: 1.45x); A.T. Perry, Saints vs. Giants (DK: $3,500 | FD: $4,700 | SD: 1.7x)\nWEEK 15 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best stacks\nNFL DFS Picks Week 15: TE sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft\nDavid Njoku, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $4,700 | FD: $6,200 | SD: 1.3x)\nNjoku went nuclear last weekend, catching six of his eight targets from Joe Flacco for 91 yards and two touchdowns. Now he gets a chance for an encore against the Bears, who have surrendered the 10th-most PPR points to tight ends this season. No joke, dude \u2014 you can trust Njoku!\nMore solid Week 15 TE values: Logan Thomas, Commanders at Rams (DK: $3,700 | FD: $5,100 | SD: 1.5x); Cade Otton, Buccaneers at Packers (DK: $3,200 | FD: $5,200 | SD: 1.65x); Tucker Kraft, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $3,000 | FD: $4,700 | SD: 1.8x)\nNFL DFS Picks Week 15: D\/ST sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel\nLos Angeles Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $3,100 | FD: $4,300)\nThe Rams got destroyed by MVP candidate Lamar Jackson and the high-flying Ravens in Week 14, but push that out of your memory banks. Before that game, Sean McVay's squad had surrendered 20 or fewer points in four straight contests. Aaron Donald and company also have 17 sacks and six takeaways over their past six games, so they'll be licking their chops looking across the line at Sam Howell this weekend. No QB has more interceptions than Howell, who has also taken 10 more sacks than any other signal-caller this season.\nMore solid Week 15 D\/ST plays: Chicago Bears at Browns (DK: $3,300 | FD: $4,100); New York Jets at Dolphins (DK: $2,700 | FD: $3,600); New England Patriots vs. Chiefs (DK: $2,300 | FD: $3,200)\n\nThis article, authored by Sloan Piva, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-13 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":544}
{"title":"Can anyone survive Fortnite as a job?","context":"## Can anyone survive Fortnite as a job?\n\n\u201cI feel like the majority of my life has been in front of a screen,\u201d Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney reflected amid tears. A fateful kill against Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins back in 2019 had catapulted Tenney to fame, and his audience went on to outgrow that of Twitch\u2019s most mainstream star. Yet in 2022, Fortnite\u2019s golden boy \u2014 whose name is synonymous with the battle royale game\u2019s most recognizable character, Jonesy \u2014 called it quits. For many, Tenney\u2019s retirement video was a sign of yet another Twitch star grappling with burnout: sad, yet familiar. In essence, though, Tenney walking away from it all cemented the end of an era for the games industry.\nPolygon is celebrating TwitchCon 2023 with a package of stories covering streaming trends and news from the show. Check it out!\nTenney was the real deal, a perfect nexus of undeniable charisma and tenacious talent on display at least eight hours a day for years. But his ascent was a complicated one that reflected many of gaming\u2019s biggest growing pains during the influencer era. Tenney came up as an early Fortnite esports champion; we now know that esports is a bubble that\u2019s burned millions of dollars. Tenney rode a Fortnite wave that raised billions of dollars for Epic Games; a few years later, the publisher laid off 830 of its employees. When Tenney blew up, everyone was salivating over Drake and what his livestream appearance signaled for Twitch\u2019s future; now both the rapper and many of the platform\u2019s stars are better known for promoting gambling over hits. Tenney spurred headlines after joining FaZe Clan, a gaming lifestyle brand so lucrative it was endorsed by celebrities like Snoop Dogg; FaZe Clan is now an infamous penny stock that tried to rip him off, Tenney says.\nWhere all these disasters converge is Twitch, the livestreaming platform that\u2019s home to over 30 million daily viewers. Many would say the writing is on the wall for Twitch, after endless headlines about losing top talent, poor management, bad platform policies, and creator burnout. But the idea that Twitch has lost its way after an ostensible golden era is an easy narrative that misses something much starker. If Twitch is in trouble in 2023, it\u2019s not because things have gotten worse. Everything you\u2019re seeing is the natural progression of an unsustainable system. The prognosis has always been terminal; we\u2019ve just refused to see it because it\u2019s been profitable.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for publishers to see that Twitch could make or break a game. Around 2018, Twitch and its personalities turned Fortnite into a juggernaut so powerful, much of the gaming industry started molding itself in its image. While an approachable aesthetic and surprising gameplay made for good viewing, what kept Fortnite from being a mere fad was the model. Before, content expansions and adjustments could take months, if not years, to hit, and you might have to shell out money to see any of it. Fortnite set a more cutthroat standard: free weekly content updates.\nEpic could swing this ceaseless delivery because the bulk of its profits at the time came from its engine, which many games \u2014 including Fortnite\u2019s competitors \u2014 license. It was these deep pockets that made Fortnite possible in the first place: The bubbly shooter was initially a flop before Epic perfected the formula. The cadence also let Epic quickly adapt Fortnite to whatever was trending or novel, whether that was Among Us or Splatoon. Much like Roblox, Fortnite became a game that could give you anything \u2014 and if Epic didn\u2019t emulate it, the players would.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t replicate Fortnite\u2019s growth from, like, the [content creator] standpoint and also definitely from the developer standpoint,\u201d says a Twitch streamer turned game developer who requested anonymity because he isn\u2019t authorized to discuss the popular AAA live-service shooter that he works on.\nThe conditions that made everything possible were unique, yet immaterial to publishers who could only imagine profits. Suddenly, \u201clive service\u201d was everywhere \u2014 and games like Overwatch, which couldn\u2019t achieve a similar pace, were posed as disappointments by content creators.\nDoes an average player truly need their favorite game to give them something new, week in and week out? Developers say getting half of their players to actually finish games is unusual and worth celebrating, because the reality is that most people will never finish a game they start. Twenty-two percent of purchased games on Steam are unplayed outright. A number of things affect these percentages, like being a part of a sale or Game Pass, but the statistics still paint a picture. A reported 25% of players between the ages of 18 and 34 enjoy games between three and six hours a week, 28% play two hours or less, and 19% play between 13 to 24 hours or more, according to Statista. As they get older, fans apparently spend less time in games. In the most engaged age group, half of all players only log a couple of hours or so per week in their favorite games.\nA serious Twitch streamer who goes live daily or logs a full workday during their schedule will typically play much, much more than the people who are watching them. Twitch streamers can\u2019t stop; a mere two-day pause might mean losing thousands of paying subscribers. There\u2019s a big incentive to keep up with live-service updates as well. There\u2019s some FOMO involved; while certain events with special prizes happen yearly, other big occasions, like season finales, only happen once. But the numbers don\u2019t lie: Your viewership will definitely be impacted by new patches that float the game in question to Twitch\u2019s front page.\n\u201cMultiplayer games will start decreasing in viewership after the first week as the launch hype dies down and then it\u2019s a question of how good the game is perceived to be that will determine its long term fate,\u201d says StreamElements\u2019 public relations director Chase. \u201cWith those in for the long haul, viewership tends to plateau and then spike when new content and patches are released or if it is supported by competitive events.\u201d\nWhile the playing habits of a Twitch streamer don\u2019t represent the average player by any means, content creators certainly shape public opinion about games.\n\u201cNegative sentiment is very profitable,\u201d says the AAA game developer, who noted that social media platforms are built to highlight popular \u2014 and sometimes caustic \u2014 content. This dynamic sets up an inherent tension between game developers and hardcore players like Twitch streamers, who are not the main audience of most games but are often some of the most visible players.\n\u201cI don\u2019t at all think that streamers are embodying some typical player behaviors, like \u2018Brandon,\u2019\u201d the developer continues, posing a name for an imaginary everyday consumer. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a model of consumers nowadays who probably parrot those sentiments. They did not arrive at those conclusions themselves.\u201d\n\u201cThere is inherently [a] vicious and negative cycle for everyone involved, for how live service interacts with Twitch as a medium\u201d\nThe misinformation will vary, but Twitch both shapes that discourse while also becoming the very metric that people use to make sense of a game\u2019s situation. It\u2019s gotten so bad that people scrutinize Twitch longevity for single-player games, not just live-service or multiplayer ones.\nAnd so, to keep up with expectations, games as a whole are getting longer \u2014 and more expensive. It takes multiple studios to keep yearly live-service franchises like Call of Duty afloat, as noted in the CMA\u2019s report on Activision Blizzard. That same report says that the development budget of a AAA game can range anywhere from $80 million to $380 million, and seasonal updates in particular require anywhere from $50 million to $65 million to produce. For publishers, keeping up with the competition requires nearly as much money as making a big-budget game in the first place. For contrast, a modern Tomb Raider game had a budget between $75 million and $100 million, not counting marketing costs.\nMarketing by itself has eye-popping numbers as well: A 2018 report noted that the marketing budgets alone for some titles can equal 75% to 100% of what was spent on development, effectively doubling the total production cost. The channels publishers will pursue are varied, but Twitch streamers command a percentage of it. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen a shift toward personality-based promotion, with more and more publishers eschewing traditional press at launch in favor of coverage they can control. Blevins, by himself, apparently commanded a $1 million payday for streaming Apex Legends, a game that\u2019s popularity can be attributed to its enormous Twitch-focused launch.\nWho can actually compete in the environment all of these conditions have created? Giant publishers who make live-service games, mostly. All 10 of the most-watched games on Twitch in 2022 were live-service games with regular updates. And the cost goes beyond money. As Fortnite took off, developers at Epic Games said that they experienced months of crunch that required 70-to-100-hour weeks to produce that industry-shaping content despite the publisher\u2019s deep pockets. That\u2019s the model that a lot of this hinges on, an egregious work week that often still requires the cheap benefits of outsourcing and contractors who are routinely laid off. Things haven\u2019t changed much since 2019 at some major studios: Diablo 4\u2019s developers say they also underwent crunch to ship the game. Naturally, the action role-playing game had Twitch integration from the jump, and alongside a detailed content roadmap. There\u2019s little incentive for any of this to change, even as big-budget games buckle under their own weight and studios are closing left and right. Not when publishers know that the longer a player is hooked, the more likely it is that they\u2019ll spend money.\nAt this point, live-service games need content creators like Twitch streamers to stay solvent. According to the developer speaking to Polygon, streamers help old games transform into new and visible moments. Developers need live-service games to stay in the conversation, because the base experience can worsen without a persistent player base.\nIt\u2019s \u201cnot even from a cost perspective,\u201d the developer says, though obviously more players make profits more viable. \u201cBut [if] we don\u2019t have 20,000 players, then matchmaking times are terrible. Or connections will be pretty bad because we can\u2019t mobilize players together in a single match. There\u2019s all these cascading effects.\u201d\nWhile a Twitch streamer\u2019s livelihood depends on having a steady stream of content, the system taxes them, too. Tenney\u2019s goodbye to his fans was a crushing one, because the path that led him there was fueled by lost youth and a dream. Over time, the promise of a dream job \u2014 get paid to play games! \u2014 became corporatized, and contracts turned things ugly. Tenney said he started feeling trapped, and he didn\u2019t like how much his decisions started being motivated by money. Tenney is hardly alone here now that Twitch has \u201cgrown up.\u201d\n\u201cThere is inherently [a] vicious and negative cycle for everyone involved, for how live service interacts with Twitch as a medium,\u201d the game developer, who also spent years as a serious Twitch streamer, says. It\u2019s been years, but he says he\u2019s still recovering from the burnout of livestreaming all the time.\n\u201cThere [are] these enormous benefits for some people, but there\u2019s also just, like, a lot of it just really grinds you down on both sides of the table,\u201d he said, referring to game developers and Twitch streamers.\nIt was inevitable for things like sleep streams, uncapped subathons, and randomly generated AI shows to materialize on Twitch; content creators feel like they need to keep going, always\nThe burnout phenomenon has been at the forefront of Twitch\u2019s public image, in large part because it doesn\u2019t spare even the most successful creators on the platform. Twitch\u2019s most famous woman, Imane \u201cPokimane\u201d Anys, started streaming while she was still a teen. Then, it was just a hobby. Nearly a decade later, Anys grew to have one of the most impressive stints on the platform. Late in 2022, however, came a big change. She informed fans she would no longer stream all day, nor would games be her primary focus anymore. Instead, she pivoted to being more of a lifestyle and beauty personality who uploads on short-form platforms like TikTok, if and when she feels like it.\nThe evolution grew from a similar motivation as Tenney\u2019s. In the video where she explains it all, Anys said that during her time as a full-on Twitch streamer, keeping up with the \u201crat race\u201d often meant playing what was popular while being unable to do \u201cbasic human things,\u201d like going grocery shopping. How could she, when streaming all day was the norm and there was always competition around the corner that was younger and more willing to stay live for longer?\nIt was inevitable, then, for things like sleep streams, uncapped subathons, and randomly generated AI shows to materialize on Twitch; content creators feel like they need to keep going, always. Barring that, live-service games are always at the ready. In her sort-of-goodbye video, Anys spoke frankly while quickly scrolling through her entire game history on Twitch. It was all live-service games like League of Legends and Fortnite.\nIn 2011, when Twitch first launched, content creation wasn\u2019t fully a career and people still uploaded their photos to Facebook. Normal, everyday teens weren\u2019t yet decrying the hungry maw of the internet, and the generational shift toward work-life balance hadn\u2019t yet taken hold. Twitch happened at the exact right time, benefiting from a cadre of optimistic young users who grew up on the internet, happy to give away as much of themselves as they could. They didn\u2019t even realize it was happening, in many cases, and they couldn\u2019t imagine the unsustainable system it would go on to create. People were just having fun.\nThings have changed since then. Twitch has crowned millionaires, like F\u00e9lix \u201cxQc\u201d Lengyel, who wear thick diamond chains around their necks while streaming. At the same time, viewership is dropping after years of platform growth that was partially bolstered by the COVID-19 pandemic, all while top creators are streaming less. The gaming industry, which likes to boast about how much money it makes in comparison to other forms of entertainment, is laying off workers nearly every week at top studios. Meanwhile, the overall gaming market is shrinking. The cracks in the system that produces and promotes big-budget games are getting hard to ignore.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world,\u201d Tenney said in his goodbye video, which is overflowing with footage of esports casters and viewers in awe of his Fortnite plays.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this since I was a kid, man,\u201d he continued, shaking his head. \u201cI feel like my childhood and even some of my adulthood kind of flushed away. I feel like this is the end of the journey, man.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Patricia Hernandez, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-19 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":545}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nAnother infamous European night at Old Trafford. It should be a landmark low, but almost the most deflating element of this 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich was how grimly routine it all felt.\nManchester United, one of the grandest and richest names in this competition, have again gone out of the Champions League at the group stage. It is the third time it has happened since Sir Alex Ferguson, meaning it\u2019s their most common round of exit in that period.\nThe performance this season was so bad that they find themselves out of Europe altogether as the bottom team in the group, although some at the club might find solace from that. There wasn\u2019t much else. The second place they aimed for has instead gone to Copenhagen, a club with a fraction of United\u2019s budget. That is where the damage was done.\nWhile that meant there was only ever a slim hope of going through \u2013 and the Danish side\u2019s victory over Galatasaray ensured any win would be irrelevant \u2013 the club\u2019s rich legacy in this competition was built on such defiance. There was absolutely none of it here.\nThere was nothing much at all. Where was the energy? Where was the intensity? The Stretford End eventually implored United to \u201cattack attack attack\u201d but the complete absence of any such impulses eventually left some of the stadium booing the side off at the end.\nWith United out of Europe, there are questions about Erik ten Hag\u2019s ability to coach the team (AFP via Getty Images)\nThese are not the sounds we are used to hearing after that Champions League theme. Something does stir when the anthem is played at Old Trafford amid the lights. Well, for most, that is, except the players.\nThis is why there are growing questions for Erik ten Hag himself, even if everyone is constantly keen to put it in a wider context.\nManchester United should not be performing like this on what is supposed to be the classic European night at Old Trafford. This just reminded that all they are going to have for some time are their memories.\nIt was another utterly forgettable display.\nBayern, already through but perhaps looking to make a point after their own 5-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, didn\u2019t even need to step it up to win. They were quite low-intensity themselves, Kingsley Coman\u2019s winning goal coming from the forward almost walking through the middle of their team. Harry Kane, for so long billed as a potential United player, didn\u2019t score but did set it up.\nThis game showed one reason why he is at Germany\u2019s biggest club rather than England\u2019s. His side are through with ease, among the favourites for the competition even if they do look lacking in a few areas.\nHarry Kane\u2019s assist was another reminder of what could have been for United (PA)\nNot that you could judge from this game. It was almost a kickabout for them.\nBayern were still having more of the ball and the attacks. This was another tension for Ten Hag to overcome on the night. United were playing in quite a controlled way when they were going to eventually have to go for it, but Bayern were still getting through that with relative ease.\nIt meant the team almost looked like they were in two minds, to go with how thoughts were always going to be in Copenhagen. The news came through shortly before the hour that Lukas Lerager had scored for the Danish side, although it didn\u2019t really change the atmosphere or the energy. It was already a drab game, with a muted crowd.\nIt didn\u2019t help that Bruno Fernandes blazed United\u2019s best opportunity over the bar after good work from Aaron Wan Bissaka. It looked like it was going to be one of those games. It certainly wasn\u2019t one of those big European nights at Old Trafford.\nOn 71 minutes, Bayern managed what they had been half-heartedly threatening all game. They also did it at near walking pace. Kingsley Coman had weaved his way through the centre, for the ball to eventually be worked to Harry Kane. The English forward clipped an artful ball back through for Coman who finished emphatically.\nKingsley Coman\u2019s goal ensured Manchester United were knocked out of Europe (PA)\nIt was almost too easy for him. Why did Andre Onana stay so close to his line? If that sounds like the set-up for a joke\u2026 well, you can write your own punchline.\nThis is the current reality for United. They obviously have many more issues than the goalkeeper \u2013 as illustrated by the goal itself \u2013 but a strange season for Ten Hag\u2019s primary signing only continues. United\u2019s problems meanwhile combined. There were so many errors leading to the goal, to go with all of those that have characterised this entire European campaign.\nThat can now be talked about definitively, since it has been decisively ended. It is a low but just part of a decade of disappointment in the competition that has seen this club rise to its most emotional heights.\nThis game never threatened to do that. United never threatened at all. They\u2019d been involved in so many ludicrously chaotic matches that the biggest of all ended up being a non-event.\n\nThis article, authored by Simon Peach, was published by The Independent - Sports on 2023-12-12 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":546}
{"title":"What\u2019s up with Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck? Everything to know about much-hyped electric pickup","context":"## What\u2019s up with Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck? Everything to know about much-hyped electric pickup\n\nWhat\u2019s up with Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck? Everything to know about the much-hyped electric pickup\nAfter four years, the long-awaited launch of the Tesla Cybertruck electric pickup has come and gone.\nThe boxy vehicle is Tesla\u2019s first new model since 2020, when it started delivering the Model Y. Yet, Cybertruck\u2019s initial debut predates that moment; Tesla CEO Elon Musk showed off an early version of the pickup at a memorable 2019 event, when it accidentally smashed two windows while attempting to demonstrate Cybertruck\u2019s durability.\nHere we\u2019ll answer some questions we figured a brave explorer such as yourself might ask (err\u2026 type in a search bar) about Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, including details on the vehicle\u2019s specs, availability and design of the vehicle. The first deliveries, in which about 10 high-profile customers like Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian took possession of the truck, occurred November 30 at the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin.\nWhile we have lots of details it\u2019s still unclear if the Cybertruck will kick off the vehicle\u2019s journey toward success, or failure.\nWhat is the Cybertruck?\nThe Cybertruck is a steel-clad electric pickup truck made by Tesla. According to Musk, the vehicle measures fewer than 19 feet long and features a bed longer than six feet. It has four doors and room for six adults.\nTesla shared Cybertruck specs in 2019, promising three variants of the vehicle. That included a $39,900 single-motor version with rear-wheel drive and a 250-mile range. But this was eons ago, figuratively speaking. At least one variant is reported to weigh about as much as a Hummer.\nTesla is planning to offer three variants of the Cybertruck, but the prices, range and other specs have changed since 2019.\nThe cheapest Cybertruck, a single-motor rear-wheel version with 250 miles of range, a 6.9-second zero to 60 miles per hour acceleration rate, won\u2019t be available until 2025. The all-wheel drive variant has an estimated 340-mile range and top speed of 112 mph.\nThe third variant, called the Cyberbeast, has three motors that delivers 845 horsepower, a 2.6-second 0 to 60 mph acceleration rate and a top speed of 130 mph. The Cyberbeast has an estimated 320-mile range and $99,990 price tag. Both of the all-wheel drive and Cyberbeast versions have a claimed towing capacity of 11,000 pounds.\nThe company is also going to offer a range extender that will push the all-wheel drive version to an estimated 470 miles and the Cyberbeast to more than 440 miles of range. After the event, Musk took to X, formerly Twitter, to give a few more details about this add on. He said the range extender will be an \u201coptional pack that fits in about 1\/3 of the truck bed. Still room for plenty of cargo. It\u2019s meant for very long trips or towing heavy things up mountains.\u201d\nWhy does the Cybertruck look like that?\nAlso referred to as Cybrtrk in an early trademark, the Cybertruck\u2019s name, neon logo and exterior evoke a sort of cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic aesthetic. Why? Because Musk wants it to.\nThe electric pickup is made of steel, a tough material that resists rust but is hard to shape. The material\u2019s rigidity influenced the EV\u2019s starkly geometric design; it also led to launch delays and panel gaps on Cybertruck test vehicles.\nMusk has described the tank-like vehicle as \u201can armored personnel carrier from the future \u2014 what Bladerunner would have driven.\u201d Crucially, while Bladerunner is a stunning film, it depicts a horrific dystopia.\nIs the Cybertruck for sale yet?\nTesla expects to mass produce Cybertrucks starting in 2024, but unless you\u2019re a wealthy early adopter with special Tesla connections, securing a Cybertruck won\u2019t be easy early on. You\u2019ll need to get in line behind the folks who reserved the truck as far back as 2019.\nThat said, you may be able to jump ahead for a price: Apparently, Cybertruck reservations have appeared on eBay for $10,000. Proceed with caution. I\u2019m not sure how easy it\u2019d be to verify if the offers are legit, and Musk has threatened to punish resellers in the past.\nThe Cybertruck price tags varies depending on the variant and add ons. The tl;dr is that all of the considerably prices are higher than advertised back in 2019. The rear-wheel version \u2014 which, reminder isn\u2019t available until 2025 \u2014 starts at $60,990. The all-wheel drive version has a $79,990 starting price and the Cyberbeast comes in just shy of $100,000.\nThe federal tax credit for EVs has a number of eligibility requirements including price. Under current rules, the trucks and SUVs priced above $80,000 don\u2019t qualify for the $7,500 credit.\nCan I resell my Cybertruck?\nTesla indeed threatened to punish early Cybertruck resellers, but it seemed to walk back its previously published rules in a November 2023 update to its U.S. order agreement page. The rules once stated that Cybertruck customers couldn\u2019t sell their vehicles during their first year of ownership without permission from Tesla. The rules also said the company would seek $50,000 in damages from early resellers. But such language is gone from that particular page, at least for now.\nCan I fit a bike in a Cybertruck\u2019s bed?\nThat depends on the size of the bike and how you store it. From what we can tell, you\u2019ll probably need one wheel hanging over the tailgate.\nElon Musk has promised that Cybertrucks will feature beds longer than six feet. The truck bed in the production version is six-feet and slightly longer with the tailgate down. From the end of one wheel to the opposite end of the other, adult bicycles are typically longer than six feet. (On a related note, the city of Los Angeles recommends bicycle parking spaces be a minimum of six feet long, as does South Carolina\u2019s Palmetto Cycling Coalition. Regardless, it\u2019s a tight fit.)\nA motorcycle would probably be trickier. This isn\u2019t a Silverado.\nIs the Cybertruck good for the climate?\nGenerally speaking, electric vehicles are better for the climate than their gas-guzzling counterparts, because they don\u2019t have tailpipe emissions. Still, all cars are pollutive. That includes consumer EVs, since they require lithium, release tire particles into the air and demand more energy than more efficient means of getting around, such as public transit, cycling and walking. Battery material mining is also linked to worker exploitation.\nWhat about the Cybertruck\u2019s size? Experts have raised red flags over the ballooning size and weight of vehicles in the U.S. Extra-large vehicles typically require more energy, and thus more battery materials, which drives up their environmental cost. As far as collisions go, bigger and heavier vehicles are less safe for everyone around them, especially pedestrians.\nAmong EVs, vehicles with smaller batteries are generally better for the environment.\nStay tuned\nWe have a lot more questions and we expect Tesla to share more details during its November 30 delivery event. How does the Cybertruck compare to other Teslas? What about electric pickups from the competition, including Ford or GMC? When will Tesla release the cheaper, single-motor Cybertruck variant it promised back in 2019? Check back for updates as we learn more.\n\nThis article, authored by Harri Weber, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":547}
{"title":"If the Cybertruck is deadly for pedestrians, it\u2019s because all large trucks are","context":"## If the Cybertruck is deadly for pedestrians, it\u2019s because all large trucks are\n\nThe Tesla Cybertruck has been out for a little more than a week, and already people are ready to declare it a safety nightmare.\n\u201cGuideless missile\u201d and \u201cdeath machine\u201d are some of the loaded phrases being tossed around. Safety experts are \u201craising concerns\u201d about the truck\u2019s crumple zones (or lack thereof). TikTok and other social platforms are abound with videos highlighting the poor sight lines and lack of visibility for drivers and passengers.\nBut if the Cybertruck is particularly deadly for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a large truck in America in the year 2023. We have lots of data that shows that America\u2019s favorite type of vehicle is also one of the most deadly. We have very little data about the Cybertruck in particular, because it\u2019s only been out for a couple weeks and in extremely limited quantities.\nBut if the Cybertruck is particularly deadly for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a large truck in America in the year 2023\nWe need more data \u2014 and testing \u2014 before we know more about the specific dangers posed by this sharply angled, stainless steel contraption. And right now, neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) \u2014 two independent bodies that test new vehicles \u2014 have any plans to conduct crash safety tests with the Cybertruck.\nAll trucks are dangerous\nBut based on the specs we know, we can certainly draw some conclusions about the Cybertruck. Like other trucks in its segment, the Cybertruck is heavy, high-riding, very quick, and likely to be extremely deadly to anyone unlucky enough to stumble into its path.\nLast month, IIHS released a study confirming much of what we already know: trucks and SUVs with tall, flat fronts and high hoods are more deadly for pedestrians than more compact vehicles.\n\u201cTall front ends increase risk,\u201d Raul Arbelaez, VP of the IIHS Vehicle Research Center, says. \u201cFor medium height vehicles, blocky or blunt shaped front ends also increase risk. A higher point of impact increases risk for cyclists.\u201d\nThese characteristics are not unique to the Cybertruck. Trucks from Ford, GM, Toyota, Ram, and others are also extremely deadly to pedestrians. EV trucks, in particular, are more deadly due to their increased weight from the battery. And yet, for some reason, you don\u2019t see as many media stories calling out, for example, the F-150 Lightning or Rivian R1T or Chevy Silverado EV.\n\u201cVehicle weight in our fleet has continued to go up over the past 20 years,\u201d Arbelaez says. \u201cElectrification is taking weight increases to another level that will lead to dangerous outcomes.\u201d\nWe need more data\nDespite these conclusions, Arbelaez and other safety experts are taking a wait-and-see approach to the Cybertruck. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had an opportunity to measure the front-end of the Cybertruck, so we don\u2019t know how it will compare to other pickups or SUVs,\u201d he says.\nA spokesperson for Consumer Reports says the same thing: \u201cWe\u2019re going to wait for more data,\u201d citing the need for independent testing data from NHTSA and IIHS.\nTesla conducted its own crash tests with the Cybertruck in-house, videos from which were shown during the delivery event last month. But NHTSA has yet to perform its own. In the US, car companies \u201cself certify\u201d that their vehicles comply with federal safety standards requiring everything from sideview mirrors to airbags to automatic emergency braking. There is no \u201cpre-approval\u201d before an automaker is allowed to sell its cars to the public.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait for more data.\u201d\nThis allows Tesla to sell cars with driver assist systems that safety experts say put drivers and pedestrians at risk. And it allows it to sell a truck made from stainless steel and no rounded edges. The Cybertruck \u201cmeets the performance criteria\u201d for standards like lane departure warnings and dynamic brake support, according to the NHTSA website. But there is no five-star safety rating, and the Cybertruck wasn\u2019t mentioned in the agency\u2019s list of vehicles it will crash test for 2024.\nCrumple zones, or lack thereof\nSo far, the aforementioned crash test videos featured by Tesla during its delivery event have been the focus of the most questions, with many focusing on the truck\u2019s crumple zones, or lack thereof.\nThe crumple zone is the area of a vehicle that is designed to crush or crumple upon impact. Often located in the front of a vehicle, the crumple zone will absorb some of the impact of a crash, protecting the driver and other occupants.\nBy absorbing and dissipating energy, crumple zones help to prevent or reduce injuries to the occupants of the vehicle during a collision. A stiffer vehicle, perhaps one made from stainless steel, could complicate this process.\nThere are other design choices that make the Cybertruck a troubling addition to our roads.\nThere are other design choices that make the Cybertruck a troubling addition to our roads. While the hood is sloped, the corner blind spots appear to be dangerous. Tesla added cameras to compensate for these blind spots, but it\u2019s unclear what a driver will actually be able to see. The steering is digital not mechanical (\u201csteering by wire\u201d), sideview mirrors can be removed, and there is no rearview mirror at all \u2014 the only way to see what\u2019s on the side or behind is via the center console screen that\u2019s also the instrument panel, GPS mapping, Bluetooth controls, and radio. The exterior is \u201cbullet-proof\u201d steel with hardened Gorilla glass windows.\nBut again, all we have is a couple of videos. What we need is data, independently verified, before we can say definitively that this truck will cause mass death and destruction. Safety experts quoted by Reuters acknowledge there may be some shock-absorbent mechanism that makes up for the apparent lack of crumple zones. We just don\u2019t know yet.\nElon Musk is \u201chighly confident\u201d that the Cybertruck will be safer than other trucks on the road for occupants and pedestrians. Tesla has historically achieved high safety ratings thanks to its underlying architecture, which makes the car more rigid and better protects passengers. The location of the battery in the floor of the vehicle also gives the Model Y and other Tesla vehicles a lower center of gravity, which improves road stability and decreases the chances of a rollover. All four of Tesla\u2019s vehicles, the Model S, X, 3, and Y, have earned five-star ratings from Euro NCAP.\nBut the Cybertruck is a truck, and trucks are historically a nightmare for pedestrian safety. The same goes for every Ford, GMC, Hummer, and Ram truck on the road today. The underlying issues of weight, height, and dimensions are what have contributed to the current crisis in pedestrian safety, in which more people are dying on the road than any time in the last 40 years.\nThe Cybertruck is unlikely to be sold in Europe, which has a much higher bar for pedestrian safety than the US. One of Tesla\u2019s lead designers said as much in an interview with TopGear Netherlands, blaming the inflexible stainless steel exterior.\n\nThis article, authored by Andrew J.

Epic teased the return \u201cback to Chapter 1\u201d on its X account, but hinted that some more modern in-game mobility perks like sprinting would stick around even as the game turns the clock back come November 3. From the \u201cWs\u201d in the replies, Fortnite\u2019s community sounds very on board with the news.\nSprint (or Mantle, your choice) back to Chapter 1\u2026.see you soon 11.3.2023. #FortniteOG pic.twitter.com\/4LnTksppRp \u2014 Fortnite (@FortniteGame) October 27, 2023\nEpic\u2019s re-launch of Chapter 1 comes with more fanfare than your average Fortnite season. Ninja, aka Tyler Blevins, one of the first streaming superstars and still among the most popular, promoted the new content by showcasing a giant replica of one of the game\u2019s iconic Durr Burgers in his backyard. Other classic Fortnite streaming stars got the same treatment.\nWoke up to find the OG Fortnite is coming back November 3rd AND THERES A BURGER IN MY BACKYARD https:\/\/t.co\/QC3Dpr8MTr lets talk about it pic.twitter.com\/E855hGHBoN \u2014 Ninja (@Ninja) October 27, 2023\nTHERE IS NO WAY FORTNITE SENT ME THIS \ud83e\udd23@FortniteGame pic.twitter.com\/TmBvevl8aQ \u2014 timthetatman\ud83d\udc51 (@timthetatman) October 27, 2023\nFor the uninitiated, Fortnite is a battle royale-style third-person shooter where 100 players swarm a massive but shrinking virtual island with the goal of being the last man standing. In the process they generally engage in myriad well-animated virtual antics as the game has become wackier and more elaborate over time, all while dressed in custom skins you earn by playing or purchase in Epic\u2019s lucrative virtual swag shop.\nIn its heyday, Fortnite was about as ubiquitous and popular as a game can be. Streaming gameplay routinely drew hundreds of thousands of viewers on Twitch, where a cottage industry of pro Fortnite players emerged, all laser-focused on Epic\u2019s polished battle royale. Epic keeps its metrics under wraps, but back in 2020 the game had more registered players than the population of the United States.\nEpic\u2019s hit game has both imported and exported popular culture since its launch in 2017. Like other live service online games, Fortnite releases new content every three-ish months, refreshing the destinations scattered across its cartoony island locale, changing the rules of physics and generally adding additional mayhem, often in the form of weapons.\nThose seasons are punctuated by flashy concerts and pop culture tie-ins, like a psychedelic Ariana Grande show, an in-game lightsaber fight with Darth Vader or the appearance of Dragon Ball Z\u2019s Goku as an in-game skin. The massive online shop for skins and other character customizations betrays Epic\u2019s loftier aspirations of building an interconnected virtual online world \u2014 a kind of metaverse, if you will.\nIn Fortnite, the map is everything. A bad map can ruin a chapter and players often wax nostalgic about in-game locales \u2014 usually alliterative hotspots with names like Tilted Towers or Loot Lake. Without a clear glimpse into what Fortnite\u2019s player base looks like these days, it\u2019s tough to know why Epic would decide to go retro and bring the game back to an older save state.\nIn 2023, Fortnite is far from dead. The game is still very popular, even if it\u2019s not clear exactly how popular. But if Fortnite was once lightning in a bottle, between other free-to-play rivals like Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone and others, that bottle is a lot more crowded these days.\nNostalgia sells in 2023\nEpic\u2019s decision to turn back the clock might seem small to anyone who hasn\u2019t dropped in off the Battle Bus, but it\u2019s an interesting reflection of the state of gaming right now. Games \u2014 and gamers\u2019 tastes \u2014 are increasingly following the wider entertainment trend of digging up familiar stories and repackaging them.\nGame developers seemed to believe for a time that cutting-edge graphics and hyper-realism were what consumers really wanted, but gamers\u2019 appetites have trended toward retro visuals, nostalgia and familiar game worlds more and more. That lower bar for visual fidelity also opens the doors for inventive indie games that don\u2019t rely on big budgets to shine, but the world\u2019s biggest game developers are riding the wave too.\nThis year\u2019s hit new Zelda game Tears of the Kingdom literally built a new game on top of the old one and remains a strong contender for Game of the Year. Competition is stiff though, more so now that Nintendo just casually dropped Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the first two-dimensional side-scrolling Mario game in more than a decade \u2014 another portal to the past given its departure from a long string of recent 3D Super Mario titles.\nSquare Enix was so confident in its remake of the 1997 Japanese roleplaying mega-hit Final Fantasy VII that the reimagined version of the game comprises three standalone full-length games, each spaced a few years apart.\nWorld of Warcraft paved the way\nFortnite\u2019s experiment to bring players back into the fold by relaunching an original version of the game will be interesting to watch, but it isn\u2019t a first. World of Warcraft, the fantasy roleplaying game once synonymous with online gaming, did something similar just a few years ago. Blizzard Entertainment, which developed the massively multiplayer online game (MMO), launched World of Warcraft Classic back in 2019, even as a modern version of the game remained online and playable.\nElizabeth Harper, editorial director of the longtime dedicated World of Warcraft news site Blizzard Watch, told TechCrunch that Blizzard actually reluctantly launched the old-school version of its game in response to demands from its own community.\n\u201cBefore WoW Classic originally launched, third parties were already running their own versions of \u2018classic\u2019 servers,\u201d Harper said. \u201cGame mechanics and class balance were extremely different then, and there was a lot of nostalgia for the community that existed back in the day.\u201d\nWhile Fortnite players, like WoW players, have a ton of nostalgia for the older version of the game, its maps were comparably simple and difficult to traverse. For players accustomed to gaming\u2019s modern quality of life improvements, old games can feel sparse and clunky if not reimagined outright.\n\u201cWoW Classic has been a runaway success, and fans can\u2019t get enough of re-releases of classic content, devouring each expansion and raid tier as they\u2019re rolled out. However, the WoW Classic team\u2019s philosophy has evolved since it was released: [Blizzard] initially was very serious about releasing the game without any changes, but these days the team feels that some changes need to be made,\u201d Harper said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not an expert in Fortnite, but a smart game developer will pay close attention to the features that spark that nostalgic joy and keep those in the forefront, while considering retaining modern conveniences that players appreciate.\u201d\nEpic hasn\u2019t shown its full hand for the new-old version of its own game, but it does sound like some of Fortnite\u2019s quality of life improvements will be sticking around, including sprinting and \u201cmantling,\u201d a parkour-like move that lets players climb over obstacles. In recent years, Epic has sprinkled all sorts of zany mobility options onto its map, letting players fall through the sky, pilot biplanes or (our personal preference) roll in a giant hamster ball to get around faster.\n\u201cWith MMOs, it\u2019s easier than ever for gaming experiences to be lost completely to time. New versions overwrite old versions, making original games inaccessible,\u201d Harper said.\n\u201cWorld of Warcraft will be 19 years old in November, and practically every feature and zone the game launched with has been remade in the years since\u2026. It\u2019s a ship of Theseus.\u201d\nMuch like the revolutions of a giant oversized hamster hurtling down from Fortnite\u2019s rave cave, gaming\u2019s nostalgia cycles are speeding up, with relaunches and remakes coming on quick. World of Warcraft Classic recreated a 15-year-old version of the game, but Fortnite\u2019s own blast from the past seeks to capture the magic of a relatively very recently bygone era.\n\u201cNostalgia sells, but it only sells because there\u2019s demand. Gamers want to go back and revisit their favorite games as they originally were, and I think developers who re-release games are developers who pay attention to their communities,\u201d Harper said.\n\u201cSure, there\u2019s a cynical side to this: game companies are in it to make money. But if we didn\u2019t love these classic games, they wouldn\u2019t be nearly as popular as they are.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Taylor Hatmaker, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":549}
{"title":"VTubers have reached their inevitable conclusion","context":"## VTubers have reached their inevitable conclusion\n\nTwitch has always allowed for various forms of expression, so it was no surprise when VTubing found a home on the platform, quickly gaining popularity among English-speaking audiences in 2019. Since then, the novelty of avatar-based content may have worn off, but the format has stuck around. And VTubing agencies, which continue to introduce new talents and offer one of the more financially secure methods of pursuing this sort of content, are still holding on in an attempt to harness new talent.\nVTubing exploded onto the wider North American and European markets when Cover Corporation launched the English branch of Hololive Production in 2020. Hololive\u2019s English debut saw the introduction of long-standing talents in the English community, such as the extremely popular Gawr Gura (the most subscribed-to Hololive talent to date) and Ninomae Ina\u2019nis. Even high-profile content creators like Pokimane pivoted toward using digital avatars weeks after Hololive\u2019s first generation of English talents debuted. Brands, too: Remember the Tony the Tiger VTuber in August of 2022?\nMany creators that jumped on the trend have since stopped using their avatars, but at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a large increase in VTubers on Twitch and other streaming platforms, like YouTube, as models and equipment became more accessible to the general public. Twitch has since gone on to highlight a wide variety of VTubers through its VTuber Takeover promotion, which most recently ran in August. Twitch also reported that VTubing-related content on the platform shot up by some 350% between January and August 2022. Despite this, some have argued that the VTubing bubble has all but burst.\nPolygon is celebrating TwitchCon 2023 with a package of stories covering streaming trends and news from the show. Check it out!\n\u201cI do feel that VTubing has become less novel as the market has become more saturated,\u201d says a streamer with agency Nijisanji who is not approved to speak publicly. \u201cThere are obviously some ups and downs when it comes to working with an agency as well, which requires a lot of patience if I\u2019m honest. And there are some decisions that are made that sometimes don\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d\nAgencies for VTubers manage their talents, often assigning them a manager that helps organize interviews, collaborations, paid promotions, and ad content on streams. Sometimes they can be financial advisors, but that is not always the case, as money made through agencies may include subscription or merchandise sales.\nThe source at Nijisanji notes that all talents within the agency are under nondisclosure agreements, which prevents them from sharing information with their audiences that could compromise their identity, or even inform viewers on why they could be graduating \u2014 which is effectively retirement for VTubers.\n\u201cSeeing agencies like Hololive and Nijisanji shut down entire branches or graduate talents without any real kind of information is heartbreaking for just about everyone involved in the process,\u201d the source says.\nIn 2020, Hololive shuttered its Chinese division, graduating more than a handful of streamers. More recently, Nijisanji announced the abrupt graduation of one of its more prominent talents, Mysta Rias. He revealed that his choice to leave Nijisanji was due to burnout. And in August, the parent company of Hololive, Cover Corporation, announced that two talents would be graduating from its Holostars division barely a year after debuting. Statements from the graduating talents were not provided outside of an official announcement from Cover.\nIn some cases, VTubers are not given a choice and can be graduated prematurely, though the agency itself never specifies.\nIndependent VTuber NagamiMugi feels as though \u201ccorporate VTubing\u201d is still a viable avenue for those looking to make a career out of the medium that can support content creation full-time. \u201cI think VTubing content has become kind of stale,\u201d she says. She goes on to mention that a lot of VTubers tend to be boxed into specific kinds of content \u2014 playing Minecraft or popular FPS games like Valorant. \u201cIn order for VTubing to continue to grow, VTubers need to branch out and create more content in line with other influencers,\u201d she says.\n\u201cAgencies should allow for talents to experiment, so long as it isn\u2019t hurting anyone\u201d\nMugi says that if VTubers took cues from other content creators and explored options like lore analysis videos or short-form reviews, the scene wouldn\u2019t be as stagnant. And like other VTubers, Mugi has dreams of going corporate. Already relatively successful, having created her own storefront that hosts collaborations and merchandise featuring other VTubers and artists, she has auditioned for several major agencies. She says that one agency asked if she would close down her business if she passed the interview phase and became one of its talents.\nThis isn\u2019t entirely uncommon, as the source from Nijisanji mentions that some talents have been given strict restrictions as to what content they can and can\u2019t create once their contracts with the agency expire. However, this can vary between talents and what is agreed upon between both the talent and the agency itself. So while agencies can be viable in terms of long-term growth for a creator, it is often strictly tied to the avatar associated with said agency. Both Hololive and Nijisanji give creators very little freedom in terms of presentation, whereas newer agencies such as Idol allow talents to create their own concepts. While that may feel overwhelming to some, it allows for the talents behind these models to flex their creativity and create a persona that otherwise wouldn\u2019t fit neatly into the clearly defined boxes some agencies slot them into.\n\u201cAgencies should allow for talents to experiment, so long as it isn\u2019t hurting anyone,\u201d says the source. \u201cLet people fail and still have that opportunity for growth in the future. More risk-taking and trying to branch out in other ways instead of simply just streaming or following preestablished methods.\u201d\nAccording to both of the people we interviewed for this story, this is an agreed-upon sentiment \u2014 that to prevent further stagnation, this not-so-niche form of content creation needs to reinvent itself and allow more freedom to its talents. Time will tell if larger agencies like Hololive (which reported 50% growth in its 2023 financial report) and Nijisanji will allow their talents to break the mold.\n\nThis article, authored by Kazuma Hashimoto, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-19 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":550}
{"title":"TwitchCon 2023 was better than last year, but everyone hated Las Vegas","context":"## TwitchCon 2023 was better than last year, but everyone hated Las Vegas\n\nTwitchCon 2023 was better than last year, but everyone hated Las Vegas TwitchCon felt positive for the first time in a while, one streamer said, but 'we are positive we don't want TwitchCon to be in Vegas again.'\nCompared to the shitshow that went down last year, TwitchCon Las Vegas was largely a success. The problem? Nobody liked Las Vegas.\nThis year\u2019s TwitchCon appeared to mitigate last year\u2019s crowding issues and concluded without any foam pit tragedies. The fraught relationship between Twitch and its streamers is on the mend after the company opened the event by announcing that it now allows simulcasting, so that streamers can stream on multiple other platforms at the same time. Attendees gushed about the overall positive energy at the convention, posting that it \u201cactually feels like Twitch is back.\u201d Livestreaming competitor Kick \u201chaunted\u201d TwitchCon with its nearby gaming lounge, but that didn\u2019t put a damper on TwitchCon\u2019s good vibes. There was even a gay engagement onstage!\nI can\u2019t believe I pulled this off \ud83d\ude06 what an amazing moment I will remember forever. Thank you Twitch \ud83d\udc9c https:\/\/t.co\/Jx0k0Q2OsZ \u2014 Lowco @ TwitchCon (@LowcoTV) October 20, 2023\nThe generally positive consensus comes after a tense year for Twitch, punctuated by rounds of layoffs and unpopular policy changes. Dan Clancy, who had served as the company\u2019s president since 2019, took the reins from Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear earlier this year, ending Shear\u2019s 16-year tenure as CEO. Clancy\u2019s leadership was initially met with trepidation; after meeting him at TwitchCon last year, streamer Jakenbake described him as \u201cout of touch with what streamers need and want.\u201d\nClancy appears to have made it up to the streamer community in time for this year\u2019s event. Lowco, the streamer who proposed to her girlfriend onstage during TwitchCon\u2019s opening ceremony, praised Twitch for improving its communication and transparency, and told TechCrunch that Clancy engaged with streamers all weekend. To run Twitch, she said, \u201cyou really need to understand the culture.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reigniting feeling that we as creators are being heard and can be a part of Twitch\u2019s decision making process,\u201d Lowco told TechCrunch. \u201cDan Clancy\u2019s presence this year made a tremendous impact on the atmosphere. He was everywhere, taking pictures, listening to creators, IRL streaming and truly being part of the TwitchCon experience.\u201d\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be TwitchCon without some grumbling. Though attendees said Twitch itself had improved, many expressed frustration about the event\u2019s location. The convention took place on the Las Vegas Strip, an area that\u2019s expensive, not walkable and lacks spaces to casually hang out with other streamers.\n\u201cI think most of us agree TwitchCon Vegas felt very positive in a way that hasn\u2019t been felt in some time,\u201d Lowco posted on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cBut also we are positive we don\u2019t want TwitchCon to be in Vegas again. Lol.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the first North American TwitchCon to be held outside of California since Twitch\u2019s inaugural convention in 2015. Las Vegas may be able to physically accommodate such a large event, but many TwitchCon attendees complain that it lacks the infrastructure to foster the community engagement that Twitch revolves around. Daytime hangouts outside of the convention center were challenging; spaces that don\u2019t revolve around drinking or gambling are scarce on the Strip, and if they do exist, they\u2019re too far from the convention center to quickly visit.\n\u201cThe convention center in Vegas was solid but the city had way too much going on,\u201d Lowco added. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the distractions of Vegas, there\u2019s enough for us to do. Vegas had the community split all over the city, which is not convenient to get around.\u201d\nHonestly yeah. The psotive vibes were absolutely amazing but PLEASE NOT VEGAS AGAIN.\nSEATLE. NATIONAL HARBOR. ANYTHING BUT VEGAS https:\/\/t.co\/G3eYWwFme5 \u2014 Redclaw\ud83e\udd96\ud83d\udd1eDinoVtuber (@RedclawDraws) October 24, 2023\nRachel Delphin, chief marketing officer at Twitch, confirmed to TechCrunch that next year\u2019s convention will not be in Las Vegas, but couldn\u2019t disclose where it would wind up. Twitch hosts two conventions every year: one in Europe and one in North America. TwitchCon Europe has taken place in Berlin, Amsterdam and, most recently, Paris. Twitch has hosted its North American events throughout California, including in San Jose, Long Beach and San Diego.\nTo its credit, Twitch is receptive to community feedback, and has had to dramatically scale up its conventions as the platform\u2019s usership skyrocketed since the pandemic started in 2020. Attendees complained that last year\u2019s event, which was the first convention that Twitch hosted in North America in nearly three years, was overcrowded and poorly laid out. The San Diego Convention Center\u2019s tight hallways couldn\u2019t accommodate so many people, which was worsened by fans flocking around popular streamers and blocking the flow of traffic.\nAttendees also complained that the venue was inaccessible for those using mobility aids, such as wheelchairs and walkers, because of the unmanaged crowds and unprepared security. In an X thread about the event\u2019s lack of accessibility, attendees said that when popular streamers walked by, swarming fans pushed around those using mobility aids and nearly trampled them.\nTwitch managed to mitigate crowding issues during this year\u2019s convention, a success that Delphin credits to the company learning quickly.\n\u201cIt was a huge demand to come back. I think fandoms have grown in that time period, just the fervor around specific creators that was totally and wholly different than we\u2019d seen before,\u201d Delphin said of last year\u2019s TwitchCon. \u201cAnd the creators themselves had also absolutely exploded. It used to be that you\u2019d come to TwitchCon, be the biggest creator, and you could walk around pretty freely. Now it\u2019s huge, it\u2019s a whole different kind of apparatus to manage.\u201d\nAttendee feedback is clear: Next year\u2019s convention, wherever it is, needs to have more accessible third places.\nThe third place is a sociological term that refers to a physical space that isn\u2019t work or home, where people can socialize without the obligations of productivity. If you can hang out there, it\u2019s a third place. During the pandemic, virtual communities served as ad hoc third places in lieu of coffee shops, bookstores and gyms. Twitch, which saw exponential growth during the pandemic, was one of them. Last year\u2019s San Diego-based TwitchCon, for all of its faults, took place in a walkable city abundant with nearby places to hang out, allowing attendees to bond, network and interact outside of the convention center. There\u2019s no shortage of third places in Las Vegas, but for many TwitchCon attendees, nightclubs and casinos aren\u2019t accessible alternatives to San Diego\u2019s more casual venues.\nMoni, a streamer working in games tech who goes by Monistreams, expressed her frustrations in a recent post on Twitch\u2019s feedback forum UserVoice.\n\u201cThey do a really good job of preparing content, it truly feels like a celebration of the community and streamers,\u201d Moni said over a Discord call. \u201cThat\u2019s their selling point. It is a celebration of streamers and their communities. However, in Las Vegas, it felt like people were not spending time with their favorite streamers or their communities because they were all stuck in an Uber or walking an hour on the Strip, or basically doing anything else but being at the con.\u201d\nFor a city designed around tourism, the Las Vegas Strip is a pain to navigate \u2014 a fact that CES attendees are well acquainted with. Whatever traffic and accessibility issues last year\u2019s TwitchCon attendees faced in San Diego\u2019s Gaslamp Quarter paled in comparison to the complaints about the Las Vegas Strip.\nWalking in the sprawl of casinos is nearly impossible, especially in Nevada\u2019s oppressive October heat. The Las Vegas Convention Center, where TwitchCon\u2019s programming and exposition hall were based, is located at the end of the Strip and the majority of nearby dining options are either fast food chains or extravagant restaurants. Taking rideshares could be prohibitively expensive (I, for example, spent a heinous $37 on one 10-minute ride between TwitchCon events), and the sheer demand for cars meant that waiting for an Uber could take anywhere between five and 30 minutes. Other events nearby, like the emo revival music festival When We Were Young and the upcoming Formula One Grand Prix, further complicated travel around the convention center.\nIt was even worse for disabled attendees. Streamer Steve Saylor, a blind gamer and disability advocate, posted that he struggled to get around Las Vegas, even with rideshares, and that those with motor disabilities had even more difficulties because of the lack of adequate accommodations in the city\u2019s infrastructure.\nFinally back from #TwitchCon and it was such a cool vibe that I really enjoyed everything about it. The people there were amazing! Vegas tho, just the absolute worst. Especially for those with disabilities trying to get anywhere. I hope I never have to go back there again. \u2014 Steve Saylor (@stevesaylor) October 24, 2023\nThese complaints about the Las Vegas Strip aren\u2019t new, and are usually accepted in the trade-off for a weekend of partying or networking at a business conference. Twitch\u2019s usership, however, skews younger \u2014 Twitch reports that in 2022, over 70% of its viewers were between 18 and 34 \u2014 and they may not have the disposable income to drop hundreds every day on meals and rides. Attendees who do drink complained that Las Vegas is significantly more expensive than San Diego.\nThe city\u2019s emphasis on drinking and gambling is incompatible with much of Twitch\u2019s usership. Las Vegas venues are overwhelmingly 21+, which excludes a significant portion of TwitchCon\u2019s streamers and viewers. Even if they are of legal drinking age, today\u2019s young adults tend to drink less than previous generations did.\nLas Vegas\u2019 frenetic pacing is enthralling for many, but some Twitch users complained that the city\u2019s energy didn\u2019t fit the Twitch demographic. Moni\u2019s UserVoice post noted that the sensory overload that makes Las Vegas feel like Las Vegas isn\u2019t as alluring for introverted gamers.\n\u201cI want to be mindful of the target audience Twitch serves \u2014 I would probably assume many of us felt the same about the overstimulation,\u201d Twitch streamer herokerrey commented. \u201cWhile I understand in-person events are a hype\/stimulating experience, pairing it with one of the most active cities in the world may not have been the best pick.\u201d\nOther users commented that they missed the spontaneous get-togethers that made previous conventions so enjoyable, and that the offsite events like creator mixers were scattered across the city. One commenter complained that transportation between events took as long as actually attending the events.\nDinomiteTwins, Twitch streamers who are identical twins and share a channel, commented that the city\u2019s size \u201cput a damper\u201d on how easily they could meet fellow creators.\n\u201cWe were in an approved hotel [provided by Twitch] and I met more vacationers, metal workers and brides than Twitch streamers in my hotel,\u201d one of the DinomiteTwins commented. \u201cA smaller walkable city promotes organic interaction as we are not all taking cabs \u2026 It felt like the priority was just being in a fun place instead of facilitating vendor, creator and community meetups and deepening those ties.\u201d\nThird places provide more than just a break from the glare of fluorescent convention center lighting \u2014 they\u2019re vital for building community, a sentiment that Twitch insists is unique to its platform as other livestreaming competitors gain users. Compared to its competitors, Twitch\u2019s robust moderation and slew of collaboration features does facilitate a closer knit sense of community among its streamers and viewers. There was plenty of opportunity to mingle within the walls of the convention center, which even had a designated room to decompress and make friendship bracelets, but organic interactions seemed constrained to Twitch-sponsored events. The diverse programming and various meetups could only do so much in an area with so few casual social spaces.\nLowco, Moni and multiple other Twitch users commenting on Moni\u2019s UserVoice post all questioned why TwitchCon couldn\u2019t take place in San Diego again. Some have floated hosting both a West Coast and East Coast TwitchCon, if capacity is a concern. VidCon, which has traditionally been held in Anaheim, California, recently launched a second convention earlier this year in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\u201cUltimately, TwitchCon is a community celebration,\u201d Lowco said. \u201cWe are there to meet up with our viewers and fellow streamers. Let\u2019s pick places that make it easy for us to gather.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Morgan Sung, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-26 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":551}
{"title":"Fantasy Football TE PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at tight end","context":"## Fantasy Football TE PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at tight end\n\nThis week might not matter for many fantasy football owners. Some have secured their spot in the postseason; others are well out of contention. However, for those in must-win situations, this week really matters. It's not the time to have a hole in your lineup at tight end, but if you do, we're here to help with our Week 14 fantasy TE PPR rankings.\nFortunately, there are several solid sleepers and streaming options despite two tough byes and some big injuries to notable TEs. It's always tough to know who to trust at this volatile position, so we break down which tight ends have higher floors for those favored to win comfortably and which have higher ceilings for those who need to really shoot for big points.\nLet's get to it and check out the TE landscape for Week 14.\nWho are the TEs on bye in Week 14?\nFew would've expected Week 14's two-team bye to be as problematic as it is, but losing Logan Thomas and Trey McBride this late in the season could have some fantasy owners scrambling.\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | D\/STs | Kickers\nFortunately, both the Commanders and Cardinals have above-average TE defenses, so taking those off the board only helps the position this week.\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWho are the best fantasy TEs in Week 14?\nAs usual, Travis Kelce (vs. Bills in Week 14) tops our rankings, but T.J. Hockenson (@ Raiders), Sam LaPorta (@ Bears), David Njoku (vs. Jaguars), and Dalton Kincaid (@ Chiefs) aren't far behind. LaPorta and Njoku both have great matchups against defenses that entered last week in the top 10 in fantasy points per game (FPPG) allowed to TEs, and we know what Kelce, Hockenson, and Kincaid do every week in PPR formats.\nGeorge Kittle (vs. Seahawks) doesn't have a great matchup -- especially when you remember that he had just three catches for 19 yards against Seattle in Week 12 -- but he remains a must-start given his high ceiling in any matchup.\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nWho are the best fantasy TE sleepers, pickups, & streamers in Week 14?\nIt can be tough to trust Taysom Hill (vs. Panthers) in full-point PPR leagues, but a matchup against the league's second-worst run defense gives him a high ceiling regardless of format. He's been more involved as a receiver this year, so he'll get a few catches to go along with the rushing stats, too. With Derek Carr (concussion) banged up, Hill might throw more this week, too.\nGerald Everett (vs. Broncos) and Isaiah Likely (vs. Rams) have matchups against bottom-six TE defenses, and Cole Kmet (vs. Lions), Jake Ferguson (vs. Eagles), and Kyle Pitts (vs. Buccaneers) also have above-average matchups that give them higher floors and higher ceilings than usual.\nFor those in deeper leagues, Tyler Conklin (vs. Texans), and Cade Otton (@ Falcons) both have matchups against defenses that entered last week in the top five for FPPG allowed to TEs. Brevin Jordan (@ Jets) and Tanner Hudson (vs. Colts) also have highly favorable matchups and can work as deep-league PPR plays, though Jordan's outlook is entirely dependent on whether Dalton Schultz (hamstring) is healthy.\nWEEK 14 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nWho are the biggest potential fantasy TE busts in Week 14?\nDallas Goedert (@ Cowboys) isn't a \"must-start\" if he returns from his forearm injury this week. That said, he's also not a \"must-sit.\" He had three catches and 50 yards against Dallas in Week 9 before exiting early with the forearm injury, so he can clearly produce against this defense. Still, it's smart to check your other options before trusting Goedert.\nThe same goes for Evan Engram (@ Browns). He's generally more reliable in PPR leagues, but he's facing a Browns' defense that allows the fewest FPPG to TEs. Both Engram and Pat Freiermuth (vs. Patriots) are in tough spots against top-five TE defenses.\nWhat are the biggest TE injuries in Week 14?\nWe already mentioned Goedert (forearm) and Schultz (hamstring), but another TE who could be back this week is Darren Waller (hamstring). The Giants really have no reason to bring back their star TE if they don't feel like he's 100 percent, but it's something to monitor throughout the week, as Waller (vs. Packers) always has a high ceiling as the Giants' de facto No. 1 receiver.\nTyler Higbee (neck) was banged up last week, and he's no sure thing to suit up this week against Baltimore. Even if he does, he's not a recommended play against the Ravens' top-10 TE defense.\nWe'll be updating these TE PPR rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.\nFantasy TE PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, sit at tight end\nRankings based on full-point PPR formats\nRank Player\n1 Travis Kelce, Chiefs vs. Bills\n2 T.J.

{"title":"Fantasy Football QB Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at quarterback","context":"## Fantasy Football QB Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at quarterback\n\nAlas, we've reached the final week of the fantasy football regular season. Although fantasy's highest-scoring position has been beaten and battered this year, there are serviceable signal-callers out there capable of leading your team to victory in a pivotal week. Our Week 14 fantasy QB rankings will help you make the right start 'em, sit 'em moves to cap off the regular season.\nWe're still dealing with byes -- and we had two more QB injuries last week -- but the position remains deep with high-scoring studs and potential sleepers. As we saw last week, we're at the point in the season where weather could factor into start-sit decisions, but finding quarterback production shouldn't be a problem in 10- and 12-team leagues.\nWith that in mind, let's dissect this week's QB rankings and put you on a path to end your season with a \"W.\"\nWhich QBs are on bye in Week 14?\nCoinciding with the end of the fantasy regular season, Week 14 is the last week of byes, as the Cardinals and Commanders are the last two teams to take their mandatory PTO. That means two starting-caliber QBs (Kyler Murray and Sam Howell) are on the shelf, slightly impacting the QB pool.\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\nRBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nThe bigger losses, though, come on the defensive side of the ball, as fantasy owners won't be able to start QBs going up against two subpar pass defenses in Washington and Arizona. Starting any QB facing the Commanders' swiss-cheese defense has yielded strong returns. Arizona has been just as inefficient, entering Week 13 ranking 30th in dropback EPA.\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nRBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWho are the best fantasy QBs in Week 14?\nDespite Buffalo being on the outside looking in for a playoff berth, Josh Allen (@ Chiefs in Week 14) has come through in fantasy, sitting as our QB1 for Week 14. Yes, the Chiefs' defense has done its part in keeping QBs in check this season, entering Week 13 allowing the fifth-fewest fantasy points per game (FPPG) to the position, but Allen has performed well against Steve Spagnuolo's defense in the past. He's averaging 276.4 passing yards per game with a strong 14:2 TD-to-INT ratio over five career games against KC.\nNot far behind sits Tua Tagovailoa (vs. Titans), who shredded the Commanders' defense to the tune of 280 yards and two TDs in Sunday's blowout. Another juicy matchup awaits against a lackluster Tennessee coverage unit. Dak Prescott (vs. Eagles) remains a top-three play in Sunday's rematch versus the Eagles, a team he torched for 374 yards and three TDs in a narrow 28-23 loss in Week 9.\nJalen Hurts (@ Cowboys) and the Eagles look to get back on track in a pivotal NFC East clash in Dallas, facing a Cowboys defense that let Geno Smith post top-end QB1 numbers against them last week. Patrick Mahomes (vs. Bills) is in line to put up strong numbers in a potential shootout against Buffalo, and although his receiving corps has its issues, the reigning MVP is still a top-five play this week.\nLamar Jackson (vs. Rams) faces an exploitable L.A. secondary, while Jared Goff (@ Bears) looks to build off a dominant Week 13 effort against an ascending Chicago stop unit. C.J. Stroud (@ Jets) sees a slight dip in his Week 14 ranking in a tough road test against the Jets, but the Rookie of the Year frontrunner still profiles as a set-it-and-forget-it QB1.\nWho are the best fantasy QB sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 14?\nWeek 14 is a challenging one from streaming perspective, as Gardner Minshew (@ Bengals), Jameis Winston (vs. Panthers), Baker Mayfield (@ Falcons), and Joe Flacco (@ Jaguars) look like the best options.\nMinshew is executing Shane Steichen's scheme at an efficient clip and now faces a Cincinnati stop unit that ranks below the league average in dropback EPA. Assuming Winston gets the starting nod in place of the banged-up Derek Carr (head, shoulder, back), his gunslinger play style could lead to a respectable fantasy output against the reeling Panthers.\nMayfield wasn't asked to do much with his arm in Week 13, but a potential negative game script in Atlanta could force him to air the ball out at a higher clip, boosting his fantasy prospects. Although the Browns didn't get the win in Flacco's first start with his new team, the veteran did everything he could to keep Cleveland within striking distance, racking up 254 yards and two TDs. Another 250-plus yard, multi-TD effort could again be in store if he continues to start in place of Dorian Thompson-Robinson (concussion).\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nWho are the biggest potential QB busts in Week 14?\nMatthew Stafford (@ Ravens), Geno Smith (@ 49ers), and Josh Dobbs (@ Raiders) are all risky against some of the league's better pass defenses. Stafford faces a sound Ravens stop unit that entered their Week 13 bye allowing the second-fewest FPPG to QBs.\nThere's a chance the Vikings opt to start fellow QB Nick Mullens over Dobbs after his debacle last Monday night against the Bears, but if Minnesota elects to stick with Dobbs, his rocky Week 12 outing concerns us against a Raiders defense that's been one of the more efficient pass defenses since Week 5, sitting eighth in dropback EPA.\nOn the other hand, after an elite Week 13 effort in Seattle's one-possession loss to Dallas, fantasy owners might go looking to chase points with Smith, but replicating last week's showing against the 49ers is a completely different ask for a QB who's underwhelmed this season.\nWEEK 14 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nWhat are the biggest QB injuries in Week 14?\nLeading into Week 13, Dorian Thompson-Robinson (concussion) was the lone QB injury situation we were closely monitoring. Even if Thompson-Robinson is able to clear concussion protocol in time for Week 14, we expect Flacco to make his second start as a Brown.\nThis week, we unfortunately saw Kenny Pickett (ankle) and Derek Carr (head, shoulder, back) exit their respective contests with injuries, complicating their statuses for Week 14. We've replaced both QBs with backups Mitchell Trubisky and Jameis Winston, respectively, as early indications point toward both missing time.\nUPDATE: Trevor Lawrence suffered an ankle injury on Monday, which will likely keep him out for at least a week and open the door for C.J.

{"title":"Totals Betting - What is an Over\/Under Bet?","context":"## Totals Betting - What is an Over\/Under Bet?\n\nIn sports betting, betting on totals is a favorite option alongside point spreads and moneylines.\nRather than pick the winner or the winning margin, with totals betting (a.k.a. over\/unders), you predict the game\u2019s combined score.\nIn the sections below, we'll explain totals betting completely incluidng its main attributes, over\/under examples from multiple sports, and some totals betting pointers for both novice and seasoned bettors.\nWhat is an over\/under bet?\nA totals bet, commonly known as an over\/under bet, involves betting on the combined score of both teams in a game.\nBookmakers set a predicted total score for the game, and bettors choose whether they think the actual combined score will surpass (over) or fall short of (under) that number.\nFor instance, if an NBA betting site sets the total for a basketball game at 210.5 points, those who bet the \"over\" would win if the combined score of the two teams is 211 or more.\nThose who bet the \"under\" would win if the score totals 210 or less. The 0.5 ensures no chance of a tie, as teams can't score in half-points.\nYour only concern is whether the final combined score will fall over or under the line set by oddsmakers.\nHow do over\/under odds work?\nWhen placing totals wagers, you\u2019ll see odds listed alongside the over\/under number. These odds indicate the potential payout for the bet.\nTypically, the odds for totals bets are close to even, ranging from -105 to -120.\nThis narrow range reflects the bookmakers' belief that the event has a roughly even chance of going either way, with neither the over nor the under being heavily favored.\nDoes the totals line move or change?\nYes, the totals line can move. The line movement occurs in response to various factors:\nBetting Activity: One of the most common reasons for line movement is a significant amount of money being wagered on one side (either over or under). Bookmakers adjust the line to balance the action and protect themselves from potential losses.\nOne of the most common reasons for line movement is a significant amount of money being wagered on one side (either over or under).

Weather Conditions: In outdoor sports, weather can play a significant role. For example, heavy rain or snow in a football game might lead to expectations of a lower-scoring game, causing the line to move down.\nIn outdoor sports, weather can play a significant role. For example, heavy rain or snow in a football game might lead to expectations of a lower-scoring game, causing the line to move down. Other News and Updates: Any news that might affect the performance of the teams, such as changes in team strategy or recent performances, can influence totals lines.\nTotals betting outcomes\nWhen placing an over\/under wager, there are a few potential outcomes to consider. If the combined score exceeds the set total, the \"over\" bet wins.\nConversely, if the score is below the set total, the \"under\" bet wins. If the combined score of the game matches the total, the bet is typically considered a \"push,\" and the wager is refunded.\nNow, let\u2019s break down those three scenarios.\nTotals win\nImagine the NBA over\/under odds for a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics is 220.5 points. If a bettor believes that the game will be high-scoring and that the teams' combined score will exceed this mark, they might place an \"over\" bet.\nThe game then unfolds, and the Lakers score 115 points while the Celtics score 110, resulting in a combined score of 225 points. Since 225 exceeds the set total of 220.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"over\" wins their bet.\nTotals loss\nSuppose a top sports betting app sets a total of 200.5 points for an NBA game between the New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls.\nIf a bettor believes the game will be defensive and low-scoring, they might place an \"under\" bet, predicting that the combined score of both teams will be 200 points or less.\nHowever, if the game turns out to be offensively charged and the Knicks score 105 points while the Bulls score 100 points, the combined score becomes 205 points. Since 205 exceeds the set total of 200.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"under\" loses their bet.\nPush\nA push occurs when the combined score of a game matches the set total established by the bookmaker, meaning that bettors neither win nor lose, and their original wager is refunded. However, to avoid this outcome, most sportsbooks employ half-points in their totals.\nBy using half points, such as setting a total at 200.5 instead of 200, the sports betting sites ensure that a game's combined score cannot possibly match the set total exactly.\nTotals betting by sport\nOver\/under betting is a major draw across many popular sports. Let\u2019s break down how it can look across sports.\nOver\/under odds in football\nLet's consider some NFL over\/under odds between the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles.\nThe bookmaker sets the over\/under total at 47.5 points for the combined score of both teams. A bettor believes it will be a high-scoring game and places an \"over\" bet.\nThe game concludes with the Cowboys scoring 28 points and the Eagles scoring 24 points, leading to a combined score of 52 points. Since 52 exceeds the set total of 47.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"over\" wins their bet.\nOver\/under odds in basketball\nImagine NBA over\/under odds between the Charlotte Hornets and the Houston Rockets. The bookmaker sets the over\/under total at 215.5 points for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, expecting a defensive showdown, places an \"under\" bet.\nThe game ends with the Hornets scoring 105 points and the Rockets scoring 108 points, yielding a combined score of 213 points. Since 213 is below the set total of 215.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"under\" successfully wins their bet.\nOver\/under odds in baseball\nLet's look at MLB over\/under odds between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. The bookmaker establishes the over\/under total at 8.5 runs for the combined score of both teams.\nA bettor, thinking it'll be an offensively charged game with both teams having their best hitters in the lineup, places an \"over\" bet. The game wraps up with the Yankees scoring 5 runs and the Red Sox tallying up 6 runs, resulting in a combined score of 11 runs.\nSince 11 exceeds the set total of 8.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"over\" comes out on top.\nOver\/under odds in hockey\nLet's consider NHL over\/under odds between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens.\nThe bookmaker sets the over\/under total at 5.5 goals for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, anticipating a game dominated by goalkeepers and defense, places an \"under\" bet.\nThe game ends with the Maple Leafs netting 3 goals and the Canadiens scoring 2, leading to a combined score of 5 goals. Since 5 is below the set total of 5.5, the bettor who opted for the \"under\" secures a win on their wager.\nOver\/under odds in soccer\nLet's take some Premier League soccer odds between Manchester United and Chelsea. The bookmaker determines the over\/under total at 2.5 goals for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, feeling that both teams have been on a scoring spree lately, places an \"over\" bet.\nThe match ends with Manchester United scoring 2 goals and Chelsea netting 2 as well, resulting in a combined score of 4 goals. Since 4 surpasses the set total of 2.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"over\" enjoys a winning bet.\nOver\/under odds in MMA\nIn an MMA context, over\/under bets often refer to the duration of the fight rather than points or scores. Let's consider a UFC bout between Fighter A and Fighter B. The bookmaker sets an over\/under line at 2.5 rounds for the fight's duration.\nA bettor, believing that both fighters have aggressive styles and the fight will conclude early, places an \"under\" bet. If the fight ends midway through the second round due to a knockout or submission, the total rounds would be 1.5.\nSince this is below the set total of 2.5 rounds, the bettor who wagered on the \"under\" wins their bet. Conversely, if the fight extends beyond the midway point of the third round, \"over\" bets would win.\nSee more: Best MMA betting sites\nOver\/under odds in tennis\nAt tennis betting sites, over\/under betting typically revolves around the total number of games or sets played in a match. Let's consider a Grand Slam match between Player A and Player B. The bookmaker sets the over\/under total at 40.5 games for the entire match.\nA bettor, anticipating a closely contested match with many extended sets, places an \"over\" bet. The match unfolds with the following set scores: 7-5, 6-7, 7-6, and 6-4. The combined total number of games played is 42. Since 42 exceeds the set total of 40.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"over\" wins their bet.\nOver\/under odds in golf\nAt golf betting sites, over\/under betting often pertains to a golfer's score for a specific round or the entire tournament relative to par. Let's consider a major tournament where a notable golfer, say Rory McIlroy, is playing. The bookmaker sets an over\/under line at 69.5 strokes for his first-round score.\nA bettor, analyzing the challenging course conditions and believing McIlroy might face difficulties, places an \"under\" bet, predicting he'll finish the round in 69 strokes or fewer.\nIf McIlroy concludes the round with a score of 68, which is 3 under par on a par-71 course, the bettor's \"under\" wager wins. Conversely, if McIlroy shoots a 70 or higher, those who bet the \"over\" would win.\nTotals betting FAQ\nHow do over\/under bets work?\nOver\/under bets, also known as totals bets, involve wagering on whether a particular number (like combined points scored in a game, total rounds in a fight, or total games in a tennis match) will be over or under the figure set by the bookmaker.\nDoes overtime count in totals wagering?\nYes, in most sports and with the majority of sportsbooks, overtime does count toward your totals wager. Always check the specific rules of the sportsbook you are betting with to confirm, but generally, overtime is included in totals wagers.\nWhy does the over\/under betting line change?\nSportsbooks set game totals considering factors like recent performances, weather, and player status. As new data emerges and betting trends develop, this line can shift.\nFor instance, if many bettors choose the \"over,\" the sportsbook might raise the total to balance the bets. Line movements often reflect public betting sentiments and offer insights to informed bettors. Therefore, bettors must monitor any line changes before the game starts and strategize accordingly to optimize their betting success.\nIs it better to bet over or under?\nNeither wager holds a universal advantage. Success in over\/under betting hinges on a thorough evaluation of both the set line and the competing teams.\nHow do you read an over\/under bet?\nReading a total bet involves understanding the combined score set by the sportsbook and the odds associated with that number. When you see a total, such as 210.5 in a basketball game, it represents the combined score anticipated from both teams. Beside this number, you'll typically find \"over\" and \"under\" options.\nIf you believe the actual combined score will surpass this number, you'd bet on the \"over.\" Conversely, if you think it will be less, you'd choose the \"under.\" Accompanying these options are odds that indicate the payout for the bet.\nFor instance, odds of -110 (extremely common) mean you'd need to wager $110 to win an additional $100. Evaluating both the total and the associated odds is crucial for informed betting decisions.\nRelated Pages:\n\nThis article, authored by Sam Eggleston, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":554}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nOne of the world\u2019s most spectacular natural phenomena, at certain periods during the year the Northern Lights regularly light up the skies of northern countries that sit in the \u2018aurora zone\u2019 of the Arctic Circle.\nThe light show happens when electronically charged particles enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere from space, producing dazzling displays of green, yellow, purple and even red lights.\nThis is visible every year in some areas of European countries like Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Norway, while there are regular sightings in parts of Canada and Greenland too. Fortunately for Brits, you don\u2019t necessarily need to trek to these countries to see the aurora borealis; sightings have become more frequent in the UK, with the lights seen as far south as Wiltshire in February 2023.\nAlthough numerous UK locations have reported sightings in recent years, these do tend to be in northern areas of the British Isles. It\u2019s tough to predict exactly when and where the spectacle will make an appearance, but we\u2019ve rounded up a list of the best places where you might be lucky enough to see the Northern Lights in the UK.\nHebrides, Scotland\nThe Lights above Skye in the Inner Hebrides (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nThis northern archipelago off the western Scottish coast comprises hundreds of islands, split into the Inner and Outer Hebrides. While the Lights can be seen in Skye and other isles of the Inner Hebrides, your best bet for seeing the lights remains in the Outer Hebrides, likely on the islands of Lewis or Harris. The flat beaches and countryside are great viewing points, while the remote parts of the islands are subject to almost no light pollution. The exceptionally dark skies here are known to be good for star gazing; even if you miss the lights, there\u2019s every chance you\u2019ll see the Orion Nebula, the Milky Way and the Great Andromeda galaxy.\nThe \u2018season\u2019 here runs from September to April, though the aurora is most common in winter, when skies get dark in the late afternoon. In February, the Isle of Lewis hosts its own Dark Skies Festival, with events including live music, film and theatre.\nShetland Isles, Scotland\nThe Shetland Isles are a good Scottish destination for light spotting (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nThe most northerly point in all of Britain, Shetland lies closest to the North Pole and is a location where locals can expect to see the Northern Lights a few times every winter. Over 100 miles from the mainland, the remote isle is home to plenty of tranquil countryside and coastal scenery, providing dozens of spots where you can potentially watch the lights away from the light pollution of nearby settlements.\nThe season here runs from mid-October to mid-March, with winter again being the best time to try and see the phenomenon (there are less than six hours of daylight during the shortest days). Though light shows aren\u2019t guaranteed during your stay, wildlife spotting, walking and exploring the towns more than make up for any disappointment should the aurora fail to materialise.\nRead more on UK travel:\nCairngorms, Scotland\nThe Cairngorms are home to an area of International Dark Sky Park (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nThe UK\u2019s largest National Park is another Scottish destination for potentially seeing the Northern Lights. The park is home to Ben Nevis, the highest peak in the UK, and one of the UK\u2019s International Dark Sky Parks (areas noted for \u201cpossessing an exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights\u201d). This area is situated around the Glenlivet Estate, forming the Tomintoul and Glenlivet park. An area with \u201cremarkably dark skies\u201d, the region is busy all year thanks to its vast amount of wilderness to explore and wildlife to see.\nWhile mountains and hills may block views, there are plenty of dark areas that are perfect for seeing the lights between mid-October and mid-March (especially those nearer the coast, where views are less likely to be interrupted by clouds).\nYorkshire Dales, England\nThe lack of light pollution makes the Yorkshire Dales a great place to spot the aurora (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nWith a northerly, light-pollution free location as the gold standard for seeing the Northern Lights in the UK, the Yorkshire Dales are an oft-viable destination. The aurora was seen here as recently as April 2023; the park is one of England\u2019s Dark Sky Reserves and the largest in the UK, and will be hosting a joint Dark Skies Festival with the North York Moors National Park in February 2024. It has four Dark Sky Discovery sites (designated nationwide for \u201cgood sightlines of the sky\u201d and a lack of light pollution), which are in Buckden National Park Car Park, Tan Hill Inn and both Hawes and Malham National Park Visitor Centres.\nAccording to the park\u2019s website, on clear nights you can see as many as 2,000 stars, the Milky Way and even the International Space Station. The Perseid meteor shower occurs in August, though the best time to see the Lights is still between September and March \u2013 just remember to wrap up warm and follow any aurora updates online or on specially dedicated apps.\nNorthumberland, England\nThe Northern Lights over Bamburgh\u2019s lighthouse (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nAnother International Dark Sky Park, Northumberland\u2019s National Park reportedly boasts the darkest skies in the UK (so is also an excellent stargazing spot). Although it sits at a more southerly latitude than many other light-spotting locations, the aurora has been seen over Hadrian\u2019s Wall and Bamburgh in the past, and the county itself remains one of the most reliable locations to see the display in England. Lights are only usually visible here after particularly strong geomagnetic storms, so it may be an idea to keep track of these if planning a visit. Again, the areas near the coast \u2013 themselves in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty \u2013 can be better for seeing the aurora due to the presence of fewer clouds.\nSnowdonia, Wales\nA strong storm made the Lights visible in Snowdonia in this photo (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nOne of three Dark Sky reserves in Wales, Snowdonia also boasts the country\u2019s highest peak, largest lake, its own section of mountain railway and 1,497 miles of public footpaths. The 823-square mile park provides views of the Milky Way and major constellations on clear nights, with the odd shooting star to make up for those nights where you miss out on an aurora borealis show. As with most places in the UK, you\u2019re more likely to see the lights between October and March. For the best views, head to the lakes of Llyn Geirionydd and Llyn y Dywarchen or to Ty Cipar, between Llan Ffestiniog and Ysbyty Ifan.\nLake District, England\nThe clear skies over Buttermere in the Lake District (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nWhile better known as a destination for walking, hiking and simply enjoying the peace and tranquility of the surrounding nature, the Lake District is also one of the best places in England to see the Northern Lights. The area is an exceptional place for stargazing too and is currently seeking to become an International Dark Sky Reserve. Though the lights are rarer here than in Scotland, the lakeside backdrops make for particularly dramatic surroundings if the lights do appear, with excellent view points at Grizedale Forest, Wasdale, the Langdale Valley and Derwentwater.\nRead our reviews of the best UK hotels\n\nThis article, authored by Chris Wilson, was published by The Independent - Travel on 2023-12-21 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":555}
{"title":"See stunning images of STEVE and auroras from this weekend's powerful solar storm","context":"## See stunning images of STEVE and auroras from this weekend's powerful solar storm\n\nSkywatchers worldwide were treated to a magnificent aurora light show over the weekend as northern lights were reported as far south as Greece and Turkey.\nThe colorful aurora displays were triggered by a strong geomagnetic storm that peaked as a strong G3 on Nov. 5 at 12:40 p.m. EST (1740 GMT) on the 5-grade scale used by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to assess the severity of space weather events.\nGeomagnetic storms are disturbances to Earth's magnetic field caused by solar material from coronal mass ejections (CME) \u2014 large expulsions of plasma and magnetic fields from the sun's atmosphere. This particular geomagnetic storm was triggered by not one but two CMEs that slammed into Earth on Nov 4 and Nov. 5, according to spaceweather.com.\nDuring a solar storm, energized particles from the sun slam into Earth's atmosphere at speeds of up to 45 million mph (72 million km\/h) and our planet's magnetic field funnels the particles toward the poles. The supercharging of molecules in Earth's atmosphere triggers the colorful spectacles, which usually remain limited to areas at high latitudes for the aurora borealis (northern lights) and the aurora australis (southern lights).\nBelow, we take a look at some of the best aurora photos captured by skywatchers around the world.\nDebby Thorne captured this beautiful display from Cullen on the Moray Firth in Scotland with an iPhone 14 Pro in night mode on Nov. 5.\nVibrant pink aurora display from Cullen on the Moray Firth in Scotland looking towards Bow Fiddle Rock.

{"title":"Shop 200+ Walmart doorbuster deals for Black Friday","context":"## Shop 200+ Walmart doorbuster deals for Black Friday\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents What are Walmart's Black Friday hours in 2023? Is Walmart holding a Cyber Monday sale? TV deals Laptop deals Headphone\/earbud deals Tablet deals Smartwatch deals Gaming deals Speaker and soundbar deals Vacuum deals Robot vacuum deals Home and kitchen deals Outdoor deals Apple deals Pet deals Fitness deals Toys and gift deals\nUPDATE: Nov. 25, 2023, 4:00 a.m. EST We've updated this story with the latest deals from the Walmart early Cyber Monday sale.\nEarly birds already know that Walmart launched its first round of Black Friday deals back on Nov. 8 and just dished out another round the day before Thanksgiving. Some of the retailer's most popular rollbacks have already sold out. Leave items in your shopping cart too long and you'll risk losing out on your haul.\nAlthough the official Black Friday programming has kept us busy all month long, the big day has finally arrived \u2014 actual Black Friday. If you've held out until now to do your shopping, we've compiled a list of over 180 of the best deals from Walmart's Black Friday sale and highlighted our favorites from different departments. We'll be updating the list throughout Cyber Monday, so keep checking back.\nWhat are Walmart's Black Friday hours in 2023?\nThe days of lining up outside big-box stores on Black Friday eve have officially ended, and we're not sorry. Not only is this kinder on Walmart employees, but it puts the kibosh on the kinds of doorbuster melees that often took place in the past. (They were a national embarrassment.)\nFor 2023, Walmart launched its Black Friday deals online first, with the last round of rollbacks going live Wednesday, Nov. 22 at 3 p.m. ET. In-person shoppers had to wait until Friday, Nov. 24 at 6 a.m. when Walmart stores officially opened their doors, although hours can differ depending on the location. Shoppers will have until 11 p.m. to finish their Black Friday shopping.\nOf course, there's no need to brave the crowds. You can still find the best Walmart Black Friday sales online, and we've got a lot of them for you below.\nIs Walmart holding a Cyber Monday sale?\nGlad you asked. If you don't have time to shop the Black Friday sales or you missed out on a great deal earlier this month, don't you worry. Walmart just announced its official Cyber Monday sale will start on Sunday, Nov. 26 at 7 p.m. ET, exclusively on Walmart.com and the Walmart app. If you're a Walmart+, you can access the sale three hours in advance, starting at 4 p.m. ET. This is the first time Walmart has given early access to Walmart+ members for its Cyber Monday sale (although it usually does for Black Friday). The Cyber Monday sale promises deals on top gifts with savings of up to 80% on apparel, beauty, tech, toys, and more. Stay tuned for the best deals from the sale in the coming days.\nNote: All newly added deals are marked with a \u2728. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.\nTV deals\nWhy we like it\nThe best Walmart Black Friday deals typically include giant rollbacks on TVs, and that tradition continues in 2023. Unfortunately, many popular 4K TVs sold out way before Black Friday officially began, but there are still solid cheap 4K TVs lingering. This 55-inch QLED TV was already affordable at full price and is now seeing an extra $50 discount, pushing it below $350. Thanks to its extra layer of quantum dots, you'll be able to appreciate rich colors and deep blacks even during the day.\nMore TV deals\n43 to 55 inches\n65 inches\n70 to 86 inches\nLaptop deals\nWhy we like it\nThe total discount on this HP laptop isn't the biggest rollback we've seen so far, but it's a deceptively good deal on an underpriced laptop. With an Intel Core i5 processor, this business 2-in-1 will be more than capable of handling your day-to-day work (and after-work streaming and surfing). While supplies last, you can get this device for under $500.\nMore laptop deals\nTraditional laptops\n2-in-1 laptops\nGaming laptops\nHeadphone\/earbud deals\nWhy we like it\nIf you're not ready to make the switch over to USB-C just yet, the second-gen AirPods Pro with a Lightning port are a stellar buy at only $169 \u2014 it's their lowest price to date. (For its part, Amazon has never put them on sale for less than $189.) These wireless earbuds from fall 2022 \"sound wonderful and have almost uncanny active noise cancelation,\" said Mashable senior editor Stan Schroeder, and they last for up to six hours on a single charge.\nRead Mashable's review of the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation).\nMore headphone\/earbud deals\nTablet deals\nWhy we like it\nBest tablets under $100? Try best tablets under $30. Sure, this onn. tablet may not have all the functionality of an iPad, but if you're looking for a super basic tablet to watch videos or read on, you'll be hard-pressed to find anything in the $20 range. Even Fire tablets have only dropped down to $40 this Cyber Monday.\nMore tablet deals\nSmartwatch deals\nWhy we like it\nApple's latest entry-level wearable also has a new record-low price at Walmart for Black Friday (which works out to a 28% savings). It's lighter and 20 percent faster than the original Apple Watch SE from 2020, and it features most of the same health tools as the new flagship Apple Watch Series 9 \u2014 that includes heart rate notifications, Emergency SOS, Cycle Tracking, and Fall and Crash Detection. It also offers a comparable 18-hour battery life and water resistance.\nMore smartwatch deals\nGaming deals\nWhy we like it\nWith $439 as the new all-time low price for this Xbox bundle, you're basically getting a free copy of Diablo IV on top of a $60 discount on the Series X (which typically sells for $499.99 on its own). The only other retailer that was matching it at the time of writing was the Microsoft Store itself, and its markdown seems to have popped up recently in response to Walmart's doorbuster: A post on the Xbox Wire had previously pegged its Black Friday price there at $509.99.\nRead Mashable's review of the Xbox Series X.\nMore gaming deals\nNintendo Switch\nPlayStation\nXbox\nPC gaming\nVR gaming\nMeta Quest 2 (128GB) \u2014 $249 $299.99 (save $50.99) + free $50 Meta Quest Store credit\nOther gaming deals\nSpeaker and soundbar deals\nWhy we like it\nThe older version of our favorite portable Bluetooth speaker is decently loud for its compact size, IPX7-rated for waterproofing, and capable of charging other devices via USB (hence its name) \u2014 it's ideal for traveling. It usually retails for $179.95 on the JBL website, meaning Walmart's $89 Black Friday price is an even better deal than advertised.\nMore speaker and soundbar deals\nVacuum deals\nWhy we like it\nDyson's V15 Detect is a cordless stick vacuum with a fancy LCD screen and a bright built-in laser that illuminates tiny crumbs, pet hairs, and dust particles on your floors (so you can be sure you're actually cleaning them thoroughly); the premium Absolute variant has a shiny gold finish, HEPA filtration, and an extra dusting\/crevice tool. Walmart's Black Friday deal saves you 27% and makes it $100 cheaper than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, which has a smaller dust bin and less suction power.\nRead Mashable's review of the Dyson V15 Detect (non-Absolute).\nMore vacuum deals\nCordless vacuums\nMashable Deals Want more hand-picked deals in your inbox?

It maps your home and vacuums and mops the rooms you want it to, offering a more thorough cleaning with Matrix mode. During dry vacuuming, it cleans in a crosshatch pattern to grab any debris missed from the first pass, and during mopping, it scrubs the floor from multiple angles to eat away at stubborn stains.\nMore robot vacuum deals\nHome and kitchen deals\nWhy we like it\nVitamix's professional-quality blenders are great to buy refurbished: You'll save a ton of money while preventing an otherwise serviceable device from going to a landfill. This powerful, 64-ounce Explorian model has three program settings (for Smoothies, Hot Soup, and Frozen Desserts) and a low-profile container that lets it fit under most kitchen countertops. It's been cleaned and tested to work as good as new, save for a few hard-to-see \"micro-scratches,\" and comes with a one-year warranty.\nMore home and kitchen deals\nSmall appliances\nAir purifiers\nCookware\nOutdoor deals\nWhy we like it\nFeaturing a removable ashtray and a lightweight stainless steel design (plus its own carrying case), the Solo Stove Ranger 2.0 is a smaller version of our favorite smokeless fire pit \u2014 and yes, it really is virtually smokeless. This bundle throws in a stand that allows it to safely burn on decks or green grass, and it actually retails for $264.99 on the brand's website; Walmart's list price is slightly deflated, so it's an even better deal than it appears to be.\nRead Mashable's review of the Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0.\nMore outdoor deals\nApple deals\nWhy we like it\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 is \"a robust and elite wearable device \u2013 the best Apple has ever made,\" according to Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder. While it looks almost identical to its predecessor, it's equipped with a new s9 chip, which makes it about 30 percent snappier than before. It also boasts double the storage and has double the peak brightness and a fun new Double Tap feature. It's not an essential upgrade if you already have a Series 7 or 8, but it's certainly a step in the right direction for those with older watches. At $359 for the 45mm GPS version, it's currently sitting at an all-time low cost at Walmart.\nMore Apple deals\nPet deals\nWhy we like it\nA solid dog tracking device for pet parents on a budget, Tractive gives you the ability to track your dog's live location within the companion app. It also allows you to set up a virtual fence and notifies you when your pet steps out of (or enters) the safe area. It's not perfect \u2014 the battery is just so-so and the live tracking can be a bit glitchy \u2014 but for the price, it's hard to beat. Save $20 for Black Friday at Walmart and snag it for only $29.99.\nMore pet deals\nFitness deals\nWhy we like it\nThe Walmart-exclusive Echelon Connect Sport is a solid Peloton alternative for a retail price that won't make you cringe. And for Black Friday, it's on sale for over $400 off, knocking the price down to a super impressive $297. But just because it's wallet-friendly doesn't mean its specs don't impress. The Connect Sport features 32 levels of silent magnetic resistance, aero handlebars and adjustable pedals, and Bluetooth technology that lets you connect any smart device to the Echelon Fit app. Speaking of which, the app gives you access to 40+ daily live and 15,000+ on-demand connected fitness classes. The $297 Black Friday cost even includes a 30-day free trial of Echelon Premier membership to get you started.\nMore fitness deals\nToys and gift deals\nWhy we like it\nIn days gone by, Walmart's Black Friday sale was full of 40% or higher discounts, but the era of the doorbuster deal is ending. And that's why it's so refreshing to see a full 50% discount on a popular item like this. The LEGO Star Wars line includes tons of great gift ideas for fans of all ages, from Jedis to Padawans. This building kit of The Child, aka Baby Yoda, is just begging to live on your office desk.\nMore deals on toys and gifts\n\nThis article was published by Mashable on 2023-11-25 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":558}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nTravis Kelce believes the National Football League\u2019s coverage of his rumoured girlfriend Taylor Swift is a bit too much.\nFollowing his game against the New York Jets on 1 October, the 33-year-old Kansas City Chiefs tight end opened up about the NFL broadcast on the most recent episode of his podcast, New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce. In conversation with his brother Jason, 35, the two addressed concerns from longtime football enthusiasts who were frustrated by the constant Swift references throughout Sunday\u2019s game at MetLife Stadium.\nNot only did the football league promote last Sunday\u2019s game by speculating whether the Grammy winner will attend the Chiefs-Jets match, but cameras were constantly panning to the star-studded suite. During the game, Swift was joined an A-list group of guests, including her best friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner, and actor Hugh Jackman.\nThe NFL also introduced a special segment with Carson Daly and The Voice, where the famed host attempted to explain the specifics of football to \u201cSwifties.\u201d\nIn the New Heights podcase episode, titled \u201cThe NFL Needs to Calm Down\u201d, Jason asked his brother plainly whether he thought the football was \u201coverdoing it\u201d with the coverage of Swift during the game.\n\u201cI think everybody is just, like, overwhelmed,\u201d the Chiefs tight end replied.\n\u201cTake away your feelings for Taylor,\u201d Jason added. \u201cWhat is your honest opinion on how the NFL is treating celebrities at the games?\u201d\nSeemingly beating around the bush, Kelce remarked: \u201cI think it brings a little more to the atmosphere, it brings a little bit more to what you\u2019re watching. But at the same time, I think...\u201d\nBefore his younger brother could continue his thought, the Philadelphia Eagles player chimed in: \u201cThey\u2019re overdoing it.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re overdoing it a little bit, for sure,\u201d Kelce agreed. \u201cEspecially my situation. I think they\u2019re just trying to have fun with it.\u201d\nWhile sports lovers may not be too pleased with the NFL\u2019s focus on Swift, the football league\u2019s supposed obsession with ongoing Swift and Kelce dating rumours has paid off in terms of ratings. Per a Deadline report, NBC accumulated an average of 27m viewers, with a total of 29m tuning in during the second quarter.\n\u201cThat\u2019s gotta be an NFL record right there,\u201d Jason told his younger brother, as he noted that about two million viewers were estimated to be female. \u201cI think a few of them might have been there for Deadpool and, uh, Taylor.\u201d\nIn the YouTube comments under the New Heights video podcast, fellow fans shared their opinions on the NFL\u2019s coverage. \u201cI agree the NFL needs to calm down. Pissing off football fans is not how you repay your boi [sic] for all he\u2019s done for the sport,\u201d one person wrote.\nAnother remarked: \u201cPity Taylor. All she ever wanted was to watch the football game. Now she\u2019s being blamed and hated left and right.\u201d\n\u201cThe NFL needs to seriously tone it down and let Trav and Tay explore this beautiful thing they have going on in peace,\u201d someone else said.\nElsewhere in the podcast, the brothers revealed the one person who was most delighted to see famous musicians, actors, and professional athletes all coming together for Sunday\u2019s game was none other than \u201cMama Kelce,\u201d aka Donna Kelce. On 1 October, the NFL players\u2019 mother travelled from Philadelphia to New Jersey to watch both her sons play football on the same day.\n\u201cShe\u2019s been on top of the f***ing world, man,\u201d Kelce told his older brother. He also acknowledged how his mother seemed to be loving the new guests in her family suite, watching her son play along with her. \u201cI know mom enjoyed it,\u201d Kelce confessed.\n\u201cI shot her a text. I didn\u2019t get a chance to see her, so I shot her a text right after the game on the bus ride to the airport and was like: \u2018Hey, mom, sorry I didn\u2019t get to catch you before I left but I hope you enjoyed the game,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cI appreciate you always trying to make it to both of our games.\u201d\n\u201cShe also told me thank you because she was in an alternate universe, she was sitting there with Deadpooland Wolverine,\u201d Kelce added, referencing Reynolds\u2019 and Jackman\u2019s respective superhero movie characters. \u201cIt was a hot ticket, man, you know what I\u2019m saying? That suite was rockin\u2019.\n\u201cThey were enjoying themselves. Somebody told me that everybody was enjoying themselves in that suite,\u201d Kelce said.\nNot only has NFL viewership increased since Swift began attending her rumoured boyfriend\u2019s games, but jersey sales for the Chiefs tight end have reportedly spiked by 400 per cent, according to a report from the NFL\u2019s e-commerce partner, Fanatics.\nFollowing critcism the league is focusing too much on Swift, the NFL responded with an official statement handed to People on 4 October.\n\u201cWe frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what\u2019s happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,\u201d the message read. \u201cThe Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we\u2019ve leaned into in real time, as it\u2019s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we\u2019ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.\u201d\n\u201cThe vast majority of our content has remained focused on the game, our players and variety of other initiatives, including our Toy Story Funday Football alt-cast, the international games and more,\u201d they continued.\n\nThis article, authored by Kaleigh Werner, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-04 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":559}
