{"title":"Meltwater, the media monitoring startup, gets a $65M investment from Verdane","context":"## Meltwater, the media monitoring startup, gets a $65M investment from Verdane\n\nMeltwater, which first made its name around media monitoring and then got active in business intelligence using AI and big data analytics techniques, is picking up a new investor. Verdane, a Norwegian private equity firm that earlier this year closed a $1 billion+ fund to make investments in scaling tech companies, is taking an 11% stake in Meltwater, at a company valuation of \u20ac542 million ($592 million), valuing the stake at around $65 million. But that\u2019s not the only deal that is going down with this transaction.\nThe investment is coming by way of Verdane taking a substantial stake in Fountain Venture, the investment vehicle controlled by the founder and current chairman of Meltwater, J\u00f8rn Lyseggen.\nMeltwater, until earlier this year, was traded publicly on the Norwegian stock exchange. Lyseggen oversaw the company going private again earlier this year in a deal with two private equity firms, Altor and Marlin, and held his remaining share via Fountain. (The take-private deal was the last disclosed valuation and the one that Meltwater currently cites.) Verdane invested in Fountain Venture rather than directly in Meltwater because the plan will be to partner with Fountain to make future investments together in startups working in areas like AI.\nJoakim Kjemperud, a principal at Verdane, said the deal also gives his firm a stake in an HR firm, Jobylon, although Meltwater is by far the bigger asset.\n\u201cThe deal here is that it\u2019s very much a portfolio transaction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re buying into J\u00f8rn\u2019s investment company and acquiring an implied direct stake in Meltwater and Nordic HR firm Jobylon, but Meltwater is the biggest asset in the portfolio.\u201d Jobylon\u2019s ARR right now is around \u20ac5 million, while the ARR for Meltwater \u2014 which was founded in Norway but now calls San Francisco its headquarters \u2014 is around \u20ac500 million, he added.\nThe deal underscores a couple of important themes in the world of European tech and VC.\nThe first of these is the fact that tech companies continue to see huge pressure on their valuations. Meltwater\u2019s current market cap of just under $600 million is actually less than the company raised over the years when it was a privately held startup (over $700 million, per PitchBook data), and less than half of its valuation when it went public in December 2020 at over $1 billion.\nThe second is the nature of dealmaking at the moment and the efforts that investors are making to de-risk. The market is particularly tight at the moment in Europe: VC firm Atomico\u2019s annual deep dive into the funding landscape in Europe (which it puts together with a number of third-party research firms and particpation from others in the ecosystem) found that funding in 2023 halved to just $43 billion, and private equity firms are making a much bigger appearance in deals to make up some of the drop from VC.\nIn that context, it\u2019s notable that Verdane opted to invest in Fountain Venture rather than directly in Meltwater. That will give Verdane not only the stake in Meltwater, but also a stake in Jobylon and whatever else Fountain and Lyseggen find interesting. That will, in turn, de-leverage a focus on just one business. Verdane itself has only recently started to spread its wings to invest in startups across all of Europe and beyond: tying up with a partner to help direct it is a very de-risked approach to take while trying to be more ambitious.\nIn terms of technology, companies like Meltwater are at a crossroads these days. The company would have had its roots out of the businesses where humans would have physically sifted through piles of newspapers, daily, to clip mentions of a company\u2019s name, collate those and send them on to those clients to help them better track how they are being covered in the media.\nThe decline of print media digitized that effort, and then the rise of social media turned that into a wider game, sentiment analysis, and words became structured, and more usually unstructured data. The influx of a whole new set of tools to glean insight out of that data turned a media challenge into a technical one. Meltwater built AI in-house and has acquired a stream of businesses in an analytics consolidation play. (The most high-profile of these acquisitions undoubtedly was DataSift, the groundbreaking firm that was an early friend of Twitter\u2019s in monetizing its firehose only for that relationship to turn sour.)\nBut now, it has a much bigger competitive threat: Companies like OpenAI and innovations in generative AI will change the game again in terms of search \u2014 consumer and enterprise \u2014 and how any kind of business intelligence work gets carried out.\nLyseggen, unsurprisingly, believes that although Meltwater\u2019s focus feels a bit like a throwback to a problem that has now essentially been fixed \u2014 and may well be made more efficient by would-be competitors \u2014 he thinks there is more opportunity for his company regardless.\n\u201cI consider OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT the \u2018Netscape moment\u2019 in ushering in this new era,\u201d he said. That\u2019s an interesting thing to say: Netscape certainly changed how the world looks for information, although it\u2019s far from being part of what we use today. \u201cAI is changing the game for players to challenge the old guard. I think Meltwater\u2019s tech stock is already the most modern and AI-centric in its category. We will continue to invest in AI and that\u2019s something we are very excited about. We are pushing very hard.\u201d Meltwater today says it analyzes around 1 billion documents daily for clients in communications, marketing and PR.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-18 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":580}
{"title":"Earnings week ahead: DocuSign, NIO, Broadcom, GameStop and more","context":"## Earnings week ahead: DocuSign, NIO, Broadcom, GameStop and more\n\nThe first full week of December features several significant companies slated to announce their quarterly results. These earnings releases hold considerable implications for various sectors, including energy, software, retail, autos and semiconductors.\nAmong the companies scheduled to release financial figures are NIO (NYSE:NIO), GameStop (NYSE:GME), DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT), Dollar General (NYSE:DG), C3.ai (NYSE:AI) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Additionally, reports are expected from Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB), AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), Signet (NYSE:SIG) and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY).\nBelow is a curated list of earnings due in the weeks of December 4 to December 8:\nMonday, December 4\nGitLab Inc. (GTLB) is due to post its Q3 results after the market closes on Monday. With a 10% surge in the stock this year, Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system suggests a Hold, expressing concerns about valuation. This contrasts with Wall Street analysts, who advocate a Buy rating.\nRecently, Raymond James has rated the stock with a Market Perform rating, citing potential market exuberance and growth potential in fiscal 2025 due to a large total addressable market, healthy customers, and a value proposition favoring consolidation over fragmentation.\nOn the other hand, Cantor Fitzgerald started coverage with an Overweight rating and a $55 price target, as the company anticipates benefits from product consolidation and the generative artificial intelligence wave.\nConsensus EPS Estimates: -$0.01\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $141.04M\nEarnings Insight: GitLab has beaten EPS and revenue expectations in 8 straight quarters.\nAlso reporting: Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Fusion Fuel Green PLC (HTOO), IDT Corporation (IDT), JOANN (JOAN), RGC Resources(RGCO), and more.\nTuesday, December 5\nNIO (NIO)\nNIO (NIO) is all set to release its Q3 earnings before the bell on Tuesday. The Wall Street consensus remains at Buy, while Seeking Alpha\u2019s Quant Ratings maintain a Hold rating on the stock due to concerns about profitability and valuation.\nOn Friday, the EV maker announced that deliveries rose 12.6% Y\/Y but dipped roughly 1% M\/M to 15,959 vehicles in November.\nStone Fox Capital, an SA Investing Group leader, notes that NIO's stock has fallen below $8, attributing the move to fluctuating monthly delivery numbers and inconsistent EV deliveries. Despite achieving an electric vehicle delivery record in Q3, the recent 10% workforce reduction raises concerns for Q4, Stone Fox Capital noted. The stock is currently trading at its 2023 lows, but the analyst sees potential for a doubling to $16.\nConsensus EPS Estimates: -$0.23\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $2.66B\nEarnings Insight: NIO has missed EPS estimates consistently in the past 8 quarters and revenue expectations in 50% of those quarters.\nAlso reporting: MongoDB (MDB), SentinelOne (S), Asana (ASAN), The J.

Analysts expect losses to narrow Y\/Y with relatively flat revenue.\nOver the past 5 days, GameStop stock has experienced a surge of over 20% amid the recent volatility in one-time meme stocks. BTIG technical strategist Jonathan Krinsky attributes this upward trend to renewed buying interest in this group.\nWall Street analysts recommend selling GME stock, whereas Seeking Alpha's Quant rating system advises a Hold.\nSeeking Alpha author Josh Arnold writes, \"GameStop faces fundamental headwinds, including poor margins and declining sales, making it a structurally unprofitable company.\"\nConsensus EPS Estimates: -$0.08\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $1.18B\nEarnings Insight: GameStop has beaten EPS estimates in only 3 of the past 8 quarters and revenue expectations in 5 of those reports.\nAlso reporting: ChargePoint Holdings (CHPT), C3.ai (AI), Veeva Systems (VEEV), Chewy (CHWY), Campbell Soup Company (CPB), Toll Brothers (TOL), Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B), Powell Industries (POWL), United Natural Foods (UNFI), Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), Semtech Corporation (SMTC), Braze (BRZE), Verint Systems (VRNT), Sprinklr (CXM), Argan (AGX), Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings (SPWH), Korn Ferry (KFY), John Wiley & Sons (WLY), Amtech Systems (ASYS), Couchbase (BASE), Vera Bradley (VRA), Barnes & Noble Education (BNED), Oxford Industries (OXM), and more.\nThursday, December 7\nDocuSign (DOCU)\nOnline signature company DocuSign (DOCU) is scheduled to release its Q3 results on Thursday following the closing bell. After surpassing expectations in Q2, the company guided Q3 revenue to between $687M and $691M and boosted its full-year sales guidance to $2.73B to $2.74B from prior expectations of $2.71B and $2.73B. Seeking Alpha author The Asian Investor points out that DocuSign's net dollar retention rate is decreasing and top-line growth is slowing. A drop below 100% could potentially trigger a negative stock catalyst, the analyst argued, as shares have historically been volatile after earnings. Wall Street analysts are adopting a cautious stance on the stock with a Hold rating, in contrast to the optimistic recommendation of a Buy from Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system. Consensus EPS Estimates: $0.63\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $690.12M\nEarnings Insight: The company has beaten EPS estimates in 7 of the past 8 quarters and revenue in 100% of those reports. Broadcom (AVGO) Broadcom (AVGO) is set to announce its Q4 results after Thursday's closing bell. The California-based semiconductor company has seen its shares surge over 67% this year, fueled by the AI wave. This growth far outpaces the broader market, underscoring the company's robust position and resilience in the current economic climate. On Friday, Broadcom announced plans to let go of 1,300 California-based VMware employees following the completion of its multi-billion-dollar acquisition of VMware on November 22, marking a significant step in its $61B cash-and-stock diversification strategy from semiconductors to the cloud. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, a report surfaced that Broadcom (AVGO) is evaluating strategic alternatives for VMware's End-User Computing and Carbon Black cybersecurity units. The consensus rating among sell-side analysts maintains a Buy stance, while Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system transitioned to Strong Buy from Hold in mid-November. SA author Mike Zaccardi believes that Broadcom offers tech and AI exposure at a lower price, with a strong semiconductor product portfolio and solid technical background. With earnings beat history, strong expense control, and robust profitability, it's an attractive investment, he contended. Consensus EPS Estimates: $10.96\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $9.28B\nEarnings Insight: Broadcom has beaten EPS and revenue estimates in 8 consecutive quarters. Also reporting: Lululemon Athletica (LULU), Dollar General Corporation (DG), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), Smartsheet (SMAR), Vail Resorts (MTN), Planet Labs PBC (PL), Guidewire Software (GWRE), The Cooper Companies (COO), HashiCorp (HCP), Lakeland Industries (LAKE), Greif (GEF), Liquidity Services (LQDT), GMS (GMS), Methode Electronics (MEI), Hooker Furnishings Corporation (HOFT), DLH Holdings (DLHC), SecureWorks (SCWX), and more.\nFriday, December 8\nHello Group (NASDAQ:MOMO) will release its Q3 earnings results before the opening bell on Friday. Following upbeat Q2 results, the company saw a softer Q3 and anticipated a drop in revenues of 10.3% to 7.2% Y\/Y.\nThe Seeking Alpha's Quant Ratings moved to a Hold recommendation just days before the earnings announcement. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts maintain a Buy rating on the stock.\nIndividual Trader, a Seeking Alpha author, suggests that MOMO's recent downtrend may be concluding, pointing to signs of a bottom forming. The analyst added that the combination of cheap earnings and a high dividend yield makes it an appealing investment option.\nConsensus EPS Estimates: $0.35\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $413.43M\nEarnings Insight: The company has a track record of beating EPS and revenue estimates in 7 of the past 8 quarters.\nAlso reporting: Johnson Outdoors (JOUT), Canadian Western Bank (OTCPK:CBWBF), and more.\n\nThis article was published by Seeking Alpha on 2023-12-03 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":581}
{"title":"Looking for a book to read? Here are 14 tips for October","context":"## Looking for a book to read? Here are 14 tips for October\n\nKilling for Country: A Family Story\nDavid Marr, Black Inc., $32.99. October 3 How would you feel if, while doing a bit of genealogical research, you discovered that you were descended from professional killers of Aboriginal people? If you\u2019re someone such as David Marr, who has \u201cbeen writing about the politics of race all my life. I know what side I\u2019m on\u201d, it prompts this confronting investigation of the Native Police and his family connections through his great-great-grandfather. He describes it as \u201can act of atonement, of penance by storytelling\u201d. It\u2019s a timely, vital story.\nUnfinished Woman\nRobyn Davidson, Bloomsbury, $34.99. October 3 You\u2019ve read the book, you\u2019ve seen the film \u2013 Tracks \u2013 but here is the story of Robyn Davidson\u2019s life from childhood, largely avoiding that trip across the desert with her camels, and beyond to a life of more travel, houses, lovers and family. Particularly family, and particularly her mother, who took her own life at 46 and about whom Davidson has been unable previously to write to her own satisfaction. She is acutely aware that her version of the truth \u201ccan bury another\u2019s\u201d, but this one is hers.\nStone Yard Devotional\nCharlotte Wood, Allen & Unwin, $32.99. October 3 Another reckoning with a mother\u2019s death, this time in a novel from the sure hands of Charlotte Wood. A woman arrives at some sort of religious community having turned her back on her husband, their life and the metropolis. What is she fleeing and what are her demons? It\u2019s not all peace and tranquillity in the community, which has collective crises to deal with, while her previous life won\u2019t leave her alone. Written in a spare prose, the consistently brilliant Wood delivers yet again. Will Murdoch help Trump again? Credit: The New York Times\nThe Fall: The End of the Murdoch Empire\nMichael Wolff, The Bridge Street Press, $34.99. Out now One thing you can be sure of in a Michael Wolff book is plenty of controversial detail and quotes that are not always fully substantiated and sourced. The American writer has tackled the Donald Trump White House in three books, and now turns his attention back to Rupert Murdoch, about whom he has already written a couple. In this latest volume, he turns his blowtorch on Fox News and the recently retired Murdoch, two players who had massive roles in getting Trump into power. Next year? Surely not.\nMy Life as a Jew\nMichael Gawenda, Scribe, $35. October 3 The former Age editor-in-chief, a left-wing secular Jew, has written a powerful, moving and personal exploration of his roots and the meaning of his life in Australia today \u2013 \u201cthe Jew I was, the Jew I am, and the Jew I am becoming\u201d. It begins with a frank account of why he ended his long friendship with former publisher Louise Adler over an essay she commissioned about the so-called Israel Lobby, and a public letter about coverage of Israel. But there is much more \u2013 memoir, history and literature \u2013 in this brave book. Laura Jean McKay has written a new book of short stories. Credit: Brendan Lodge\nGunflower: Stories\nLaura Jean McKay, Scribe, $29.99. October 3 Laura Jean McKay won the richest writing prize in the country during the pandemic for her timely novel The Animals in that Country about a virulent virus that allowed infected people to understand what animals were saying. She was quickly called prescient, but whether that label sticks in her return to the short story remains to be seen. This collection, written over 20 years, again features plenty of animal life in stories ranging in length from one page to 20. If you haven\u2019t read her, now\u2019s the time to start. Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon\nMichael Lewis, Allen Lane, $55. October 3 This is the astonishing story of Sam Bankman-Fried, the young man who set up his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, in 2019 and three years later was rolling in money.\nBut when the crypto world went pear-shaped, Bankman-Fried\u2019s business hit an irreversible tailspin, and now he\u2019s facing multiple charges and due in court on October 3. If anyone can be relied on to tell this story of a financial Icarus with verve and narrative flair, it\u2019s Michael Lewis, author of Liar\u2019s Poker, Moneyball, and The Big Short. No doubt the updated edition will have the verdict on SBF. The Woman in Me\nBritney Spears, Simon & Schuster, $49.99. October 25 The huge-selling American singer has negotiated the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in her 41 years, but at the heart of this book \u2013 said to have earned her a $US15 million ($23.3 million) advance \u2013 is the controversial \u201cconservatorship\u201d by which her father and others were given almost complete control of her life, but still failed to stop it going off the rails many times.\nSure to be a bestseller, the book is described as a candid account of her life \u2013 exactly what her fans want. Mr Einstein\u2019s Secretary\nMatthew Reilly, Macmillan, $44.99. October 17 Hannah Fischer lived her early life in Berlin, and her next door neighbour was Albert Einstein \u2013 he seems to be having a popular culture moment. She idolised him, and she loved physics. But events intervene and the studious Hannah is forced out of Germany to a new, secretarial life in the US. But this is a Matthew Reilly novel \u2013 he\u2019s a film director now as well \u2013 and Hannah becomes some sort of spy and action hero, getting involved with all the major events and players of the years between the end of World War I and II \u2013 prohibition, gangsters, Nazis, and more. It\u2019s a lot of crash-bang-wallop fun and Reilly fans will love it.\nThe Seven\nChris Hammer, Allen & Unwin, $32.99. October 3 It\u2019s hard to believe that Scrublands, Chris Hammer\u2019s first crime novel, was published only five years ago. Since then, the former journo has followed the crime writer\u2019s timetable of a book a year. His latest brings back Nell Buchanan and Ivan Lucie, whom we met in Treasure & Dirt and Tilt, for a case of murder involving one of the seven families who rule the Yuwonderie district like a fiefdom. You can expect dark secrets to emerge and herrings to be red.\nLife as We Knew it\nAisha Dow & Melissa Cunningham, Scribe, $35. October 3 This account of how the pandemic affected Australia is a timely publication coming only a few days after Daniel Andrews, the man who approved probably the world\u2019s longest cumulative lockdown, left office. While many people may not want to revisit those stressful years, Aisha Dow and Melissa Cunningham, journalists with Nine newspapers, manage to make this a riveting story of discovery, dismay, and recovery.

{"title":"Patriots vs. Steelers FanDuel Picks: NFL DFS lineup advice for Week 14 TNF single-game tournaments","context":"## Patriots vs. Steelers FanDuel Picks: NFL DFS lineup advice for Week 14 TNF single-game tournaments\n\nAfter what was arguably the best Thursday night game of the season, we present to you what might be the worst, as the Patriots head to Pittsburgh to battle the Steelers. Whatever sport these teams will be attempting to play will probably end up setting the sport back 100 years, so much so that even the biggest supporters of defensive battles will be begging for some offense. The NFL probably didn't envision Mitch Trubisky facing off against Bailey Zappe when the schedule was released back in the spring, but sometimes the worst games on paper also bring the biggest profit opportunities. We're once again building a FanDuel DFS lineup so we have something to root for all night long.\nBefore we break down our picks and strategy, here are the most notable scoring rules for FanDuel contests: four-point passing TDs and half-point PPR.\nMORE THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL:\nDK lineup | ATS pick | Top props | Start-sit | Najee update\nPatriots-Steelers FanDuel Picks Week 14: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments\n$60,000 budget, at least one player from each team required\nMVP (1.5x points) RB Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots ($12,000). It doesn't matter whether Bailey Zappe, Mac Jones, Bill Belichick, or Robert Kraft end up taking snaps on Thursday night -- the Patriots' offense will continue to be tough on the eyes. Points will be at a premium between these teams, and controlling the clock is definitely important. That's where Elliott comes in. He's set to start this game with Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) sidelined for the foreseeable future, meaning New England's offense will be hoping for a vintage performance from the former Cowboy. Expect the RB to be fed a ton. Whether that results in a touchdown remains to be seen, but if anyone is scoring a TD on the Pats roster Thursday night, it's Elliott.\nFLEX RB Najee Harris, Steelers ($14,000). Much like the Patriots, this Steelers offense will want to establish the ground game, and that starts with Harris. It wasn't long ago that the RB was the subject of major criticism for looking slow and ineffective, but that narrative has flipped in a big way. With an average of 15 carries per game in the past five, we can expect at least that and maybe more from a Pittsburgh team that is starting Mitch Trubisky on Thursday night. As an added bonus, Harris is also the preferred goal-line back, scoring in three of those games. The Patriots' defense doesn't give up much, making Harris our best bet for success in an old-fashioned defensive struggle between two of the worst offenses the NFL has to offer.\nFLEX D\/ST Steelers ($10,000). The Steelers can get after the quarterback and force plenty of turnovers in any given game. They're facing an offense that's posted 13 points in the past three weeks -- not exactly encouraging for fantasy purposes. We think there's a good chance of a defensive score here, boosting the outlook for Pittsburgh's D\/ST. There will be few yards and even fewer points. Even though the Steelers can be vulnerable against the pass, the Patriots are not a team capable of exploiting that weakness. Don't overthink it.\nFLEX D\/ST Patriots ($9,000). Much like the Steelers, most of that logic also applies here with the Patriots. Trubisky will have to try to move the ball on a team that hasn't allowed more than 10 points in three straight weeks. We can't envision the Steelers scoring 20 points on offense, leaving us with a low-scoring affair. New England's problem is obviously the offense, so don't overlook the defense that continues to give them chances to win every week.\nFLEX K Chris Boswell, Steelers ($8,500). Could we be in for another field goal fest? Last week's contest in New England saw the Chargers kick two FGs en route to a 6-0 victory, so why rule it out here? Pittsburgh is already starting a backup QB and has a tough time scoring against everyone anyway, so it's safe to assume that FGs, not TDs, are on the menu once again.\nBest SuperDraft NFL DFS Picks for Patriots-Steelers\nThis year, we're also listing our favorite weekly DFS plays on SuperDraft.\nFor those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.\nMORE: Win BIG with SuperDraft! Get a free $10 deposit when you use promo code \"TSN\"!\nHere are the most notable scoring rules for SuperDraft NFL contests: Half-point PPR, four-point passing TDs, two-point bonuses for 100 rushing yards, 100 receiving yards, and 300 passing yards.\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS: How to play SuperDraft\nChampion (+50% points): RB Najee Harris, Steelers (Multiplier 1.9x)\nCo-Champ (+25% points): RB Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots (Multiplier 1.4x)\nSuper FLEX: QB Mitch Trubisky, Steelers (Multiplier 1.15x)\nSuper FLEX: TE Pat Freiermuth, Steelers (Multiplier 1.35x)\nSuper FLEX: K Chris Boswell, Steelers (Multiplier 1.8x)\nSuper FLEX: K Chad Ryland, Patriots (Multiplier 1.8x)\nThis week's SuperDraft lineup features our first \"Co-Champ,\" which gives us 25 percent more points for our player of choice.

{"title":"Who Are Mikaela Shiffrin\u2019s Parents? All You Need to Know About Skiing Legend\u2019s Family","context":"## Who Are Mikaela Shiffrin\u2019s Parents? All You Need to Know About Skiing Legend\u2019s Family\n\nWith grit and precision like no other, she gracefully descends the towering snow-capped mountain. Her hair billowing in the wind, her skis effortlessly gliding on the glistening ice as if afloat, she is one with the snow and the mountain. This is the essence of Mikaela Shiffrin. In the world of Alpine skiing, Shiffrin has long been a dominant force to be reckoned with.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nAfter all, the legend has made history by achieving the most World Cup wins by any male or female skier ever. With two Olympic golds, an impressive five overall World Cup victories, and four world championship wins, she is the youngest slalom champion in Olympic Alpine skiing history. Her legacy stands tall in the world of sports, but her roots run deep as well. Here\u2019s all you need to know about the skiing legends\u2019 family.\nHow Mikaela Shiffrin\u2019s parents fell in love through skiing\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nMikaela Shiffrin is the second child of Eileen and Jeff Shiffrin. Eileen had skiing in her blood and grew up with a passion for the sport. When she was a child, her parents would take her and her siblings up Mt. Greylock during the winter, and there, using sickles to cut the meadow grass, they would prepare a slope for their children to ski on. That is where her deep love for the sport took root. However, she had to pause her passion when she started studying at a nursing college. Later, her mother became a nurse, and this noble journey led her to the love of her life. In 1985, fate brought her mother and her father, Jeff, an anesthesiologist who at the time was completing his cardiothoracic rotation, together at St. Elizabeth\u2019s Medical Center in Brighton, Massachusetts. Jeff himself was an avid skier when he was young and would often visit Vermont on the weekend with his family as a child.\nvia Getty PARK CITY, UT \u2013 SEPTEMBER 25: Alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin poses for a portrait during the Team USA Media Summit ahead of the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games on September 25, 2017 in Park City, Utah. (Photo by Ezra Shaw\/Getty Images)\nEileen spoke about her love, saying he was \u201cbrilliant, jovial, and curious, with a solution to every problem\u201d. Unable to resist her charm, Jeff had asked Eileen out on a date, and he even had to convince her to give their love another chance. That\u2019s when the epic love story began. Young Jeff and Eileen took their first vacation together as a couple and visited the snowy wonderland of Aspen. The snowy trails and scenic winter reignited the passionate old flame in Eileen\u2019s heart for gliding down the soft powdery snow, and she even stated, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Jeff, I wouldn\u2019t have kept skiing\u201d. She even stated how Jeff reawakened the love of the sport that had remained in Eileen\u2019s heart over the years.\nGrowing up with skier parents\nIn 1986, a year after they first met, the beautiful couple tied the knot. Five years later, realizing the incredible connection they felt to the snowy trails of Aspen, they moved to the world-class skiing city of Vail. A year after moving to Vail, Jeff and Eileen welcomed Taylor, Mikaela\u2019s brother, in 1992. And three years later, Mikaela arrived in 1995. Jeff and Eileen, both avid and passionate skiers from a tender age, introduced their children to their passion and the world of skiing. The couple would take little Mikaela and Taylor on family outings at Vail and teach the two the art of gliding over the snow. Later, when Taylor was 9 and Mikaela was 7, their parents enrolled them in Ski Club Vail.\nAccording to Aspen Sojourner, SCV\u2019s Rika Moore began to coach the kids, and soon the two rapidly began to progress. When most coaches would not even let other kids try the slalom gates, Mikaela, on the other hand, cleared the slalom gates with her sheer talent. Later, the family moved to New England due to Jeff\u2019s career, and the kids found their safe space at the Burke Mountain Academy.\nThe family moved to Vail in 2009, but Mikaela went back to Burke, and her mother decided to move with her and help her by home-schooling her while monitoring her training. Over the years, the fire and sheer talent within Mikaela couldn\u2019t be tamed. She even won the prestigious Topolino races in Italy, sweeping most of the wins when she was 14. Her parents tried their best to keep the soaring youngling grounded.\nHer dad\u2019s rules for her were, \u201cBe nice. Think first. Have fun,\u201d which Shiffrin has affixed to the back of her helmet. Taylor, too, made immense progress and went on to win two NCAA team titles with the University of Denver. Later in 2011, Eileen became Mikaela\u2019s full-time traveling companion and would also handle her schoolwork, while Jeff began to handle the logistics and would use his PTO to visit them with Taylor. The passion for the sport that had reignited in the relationship of Jeff and Eileen saw its fruition in their history-making daughter, Mikaela Shiffrin.\nA tragic time for the family\nOver the years, Jeff saw his daughter win one downhill, one super-G, and place fourth in a second downhill. She was at the pinnacle of her career, with her sights set on the fourth consecutive overall title. After spending some much-needed family time together in the resort town of Lake Garda, Italy, after the Bansko races, the family said goodbye to each other and made a promise to see each other in five weeks. However Two days later, while Mikaela was training in Italy, she received a concerned call from her brother Taylor asking to speak urgently with their mom. Taylor told the two how Jeff had fallen and that they needed to return home immediately.\nJeff had sustained a head injury due to an accidental fall. The family spent Jeff\u2019s last days together by his side as a family before he passed away on February 2, 2020. This shattered the family and left a huge void in their hearts. The pain of the loss was gut-wrenching for Eileen, who said, \u201cWe learned quickly that people have their crosses to bear, and they aren\u2019t everyone else\u2019s crosses; they\u2019re the ones we have to bear ourselves. You learn to suffer in silence\u201d.\nHow Mikaela Shiffrin recovered from the devastation\nFor Mikaela Shiffrin, this devastating loss broke her heart. She even said she was left questioning how she could ever ski again. Mikaela stated that skiing was \u201cthe place where I feel most connected to him. It\u2019s kind of hard to feel that anywhere else\u201d. She even shared that she was in the middle of a sports-illustrated photoshoot when her dad had the accident.\nThis left her feeling immense pain every time she would see her pictures from the shoot. Without her anchor, the grief would be so immense that she couldn\u2019t even get out of bed, said her mother. Eileen even stated, \u201cShe was so devastated. She couldn\u2019t stop crying\u201d.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nHowever, Taylor, unable to see his sister reeling from the pain one day, suddenly walked over to his mom and Mikaela and told her \u201cYou can\u2019t quit on us\u201d. He spoke in an interview, calling the moment his moment of \u201cselfishness,\u201d and said, It\u2019s what his dad would also want and how he would\u2019ve handled the situation.\nOpinion: Are New Rules by Skiing Federation Enough to Protect the Environment Amid Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup\nHe said his dad would use the phrase he often used when they were children, which was \u201cWhen you\u2019re going through hell, keep going. Don\u2019t stop\u201d. After a lengthy period of absence from the sport, she returned in 2021 for the first of the two slalom races at Levi.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn 2022, when she set the record for the most World Cup wins in Alpine skiing history, she honored her dad by writing on Instagram, \u201cThank you. Dad, I hope you had a good view. Mom, your strength, love, support, and belief in me is the greatest treasure I\u2019ll ever know\u201d.\nWatch this story: 7x Skiing World Champion Mikaela Shiffrin\u2019s Intense Workout Routine Challenges Michael B.

{"title":"Dropout\u2019s dropping CollegeHumor on its 5th anniversary \u2014 here\u2019s why and what the future holds","context":"## Dropout\u2019s dropping CollegeHumor on its 5th anniversary \u2014 here\u2019s why and what the future holds\n\nWhatever happened to CollegeHumor? Fans of the Dropout streaming service will tell you at the drop of a hat: The creatives behind it announced a new subscription service in late 2018, made a few ambitious seasons of comedy and live-play Dungeons & Dragons \u2014 and then got walloped when their corporate owner, IAC, stopped funding CH Media, resulting in layoffs of nearly the entire staff in January 2020 (which was a totally chill month to lose your job, with absolutely no major upheavals in television production on the horizon).\nBut CollegeHumor didn\u2019t drop off: IAC sold the brand to executive producer Sam Reich, allowing shows like Dimension 20, Um, Actually, and Game Changer to keep doing the work, and spinning off their most successful formats on Dropout. On Dropout\u2019s fifth anniversary this week, CollegeHumor is \u201cthe most healthy and sustainable [it\u2019s] ever been as a company,\u201d says Dimension 20 host Brennan Lee Mulligan. And for Dropout\u2019s anniversary, Reich announced in a new video, the company will cease to be CollegeHumor at all.\nPolygon sat down with Reich and Mulligan for the occasion of Dropout\u2019s fifth anniversary to chat about upcoming shows, how a YouTube video brand successfully pivoted to the subscription streaming model, and the big birthday announcement itself: CollegeHumor is no more.\nPolygon: Before we dig into the big news, I want to start with another recent announcement you\u2019ve made: The next season of Dimension 20. Brennan, I know this is Aabria Iyengar\u2019s game, but you\u2019re playing in it, and she\u2019s not here and you are. So: Why stoats?\nBrennan Lee Mulligan: Why stoats?! They\u2019re a marvelous animal. Burrow\u2019s End is a really fun season of Dimension 20. And I say fun because Aabria\u2019s taking us to this wonderful Secret of NIMH, Watership Down \u2014 there\u2019s a certain subgenre. And we find in Dimension 20 that we have our most success when we get specific. It\u2019s not just fantasy, it\u2019s Game of Thrones meets Candyland. It\u2019s not just a mystery, it\u2019s noir, or it\u2019s Agatha Christie \u2014 which is actually two of the Side Quest seasons we\u2019ve done, one of which Sam was a player in. It\u2019s about getting specific with the comparisons that you\u2019re reaching out to and where you\u2019re drawing inspiration from.\n\u201cCute little critters\u201d is a quite broad, fantastical storytelling genre \u2014 within that there\u2019s a subgenre of perhaps the darkest and most grim stories ever told. You know, I guess there\u2019s adult literature that\u2019s as haunting as Watership Down, but something about the juxtaposition of the cute little bunnies, and a story about death, displacement, horror... Lovecraft wishes that he could have the eldritch horror of rabbits trying to describe a road and the cars that drive on it.\nSam Reich: We want to take our audience and expose them to deep trauma. [laughs] And the way that you do that is by luring them into a sense of comfort and security.\nMulligan: The mental mathematics of the season are also a fun thing. The fact that we go like, Hey, it\u2019s tough being a little furry critter, the woods are dangerous. You know, we see nature documentaries where little stoats and bunnies are getting absolutely eviscerated by falcons and stuff, and you watch it and you\u2019re like, Tough break, buddy, and you move on with your day. But we\u2019ve given them names and voices. And now we\u2019ll see! Now we\u2019ll see how glib they are!\nReich: David Attenborough couldn\u2019t do this!\nSam, that reminds me of something you said to NPR earlier this year, about how you found success with Dropout in, instead of going broad for the viral video, going for \u201csomething that feels special to a small group of people.\u201d Has five years of Dropout inspired any advice for creators, or producers, or fans \u2014 basically anyone who\u2019s looking to get away from algorithmically powered viral demand, to other platform structures?\nReich: My advice is find a better business model. I think we live in an era of online content right now that is being defined and shaped by algorithms. And that\u2019s true no matter the platform. I think different platforms are shaping content in different ways, and that\u2019s kind of exciting as a creator. Like, Which of these sports am I most excited to play? Lately, TikTok has been prioritizing videos that are longer than a minute, because they\u2019re trying to encourage watch time, while YouTube Shorts still doesn\u2019t allow you to put up anything that\u2019s longer than a minute. So, platforms compete with each other and themselves, and they yield these kind of Frankenstein products. And even in the midst of all of that I am regularly inspired by a lot of the stuff I see on there. I love hanging out on these platforms. I think some of these creators are getting really, really creative.\nBut I think what the experience of doing Dropout has taught us \u2014 and what I would tell others \u2014 is for you to make this sustainable you need to have something to offer that\u2019s off of those platforms. There\u2019s lots of ways to do that. One of them is to create a subscription offering like on Patreon and try to drive people to it. Another is to try to leverage your online presence into opportunities in traditional Hollywood. Some folks who aren\u2019t content creators first and foremost are using it as a creative way to market their music or market their physical products, and that\u2019s working out well for those folks.\nI think for us, the heart and the soul of what we do is on on Dropout. We are very lucky, very lucky, that social media has turned out to be such a good way for us to market this platform. And we are also gleefully no longer beholden to it.\nThe story of Dropout\u2019s history recounted in your anniversary video is that you kicked off, and you were raring to go, and then immediately got kneecapped by a corporate sale and a global pandemic, and then you succeeded anyway. If there hadn\u2019t been those hurdles, there would have been other hurdles. I\u2019m sure you ran into other things that surprised you about transforming from CollegeHumor to Dropout. What were the hurdles we don\u2019t hear about because getting dumped by your parent company and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic overshadow them?\nMulligan: Susana, every day I awaken and am hurled Wallace and Gromit-style out of my bed into another day of making content and telling stories and doing the stuff we get to do at Dropout. Being asked what our strategy was \u2014 I think Sam is much better, writ large, at top-down, bird\u2019s-eye strategic oversight than I am.\nReich: Zooming out is what you\u2019re saying, I\u2019m good at zooming out?\nMulligan: You\u2019re great at zooming out. Asking me what our strategy was is sort of like \u2014 Susana, you\u2019ve pulled up alongside a man sprinting from a bear, and are like, What was the thought process behind going left at that tree back there? And I\u2019m like [unintelligible gasps]. That\u2019s the headspace that I operate from. But to address the hurdles that you were talking about in terms of what lessons can be drawn, or what do we think would have happened had those obstacles not been there? If those obstacles had not been there, well, my god, I would love for those obstacles not to have been there, I would definitely press that button. Mostly to have prevented COVID, which would be a great boon to the world and global civilization\u2014\nReich: See, I feel like you nailed it, Brennan. The big one I was going to point to is that this is relentless. Not in a bad way \u2014 like, we spent our lives as entertainers starving, and then at some point, we arrive at the all-you-can-eat buffet \u2014 that\u2019s like when we\u2019ve really made it \u2014 and we go, My god, I\u2019m gonna have to eat so much, forever. [laughs] Adam Conover, who is one of my dear, dear friends and also remains pretty mixed about digital versus traditional entertainment, he\u2019s not sure where he wants to fall in terms of those those relative opportunities. He\u2019s like, The thing about digital is you create for yourself a jail, and then you have to live in that jail forever, because your audience wants that from you, again and again and again. Whereas in traditional media, you have a certain amount of seasons, and maybe you get canceled, then you move on to something else.\nI think Brennan and I both are in jail right now. The way in which we\u2019re lucky is we both jailed ourselves inside anthology series.\nMulligan: Yeah.\nReich: So, thank god for that bit of (it turns out) foresight, happy accident \u2014 which is we get to strut our stuff in lots of different ways despite the fact that we\u2019re beholden to these shows, which, so long as Dropout continues to be successful, will never be canceled? Because...?\nMulligan: Yeah, \u201cno gods no masters\u201d is a pretty exciting place to have found that [success]. And to Sam\u2019s point too, yeah, every time that I go, Woof, we make a lot of this show, I turn around and see the ghost of my absolutely starving 25-year-old self being like, [sarcastically] Oh, you got big problems, huh? Ohhh, big guy got big problems! Wow! [villainously] I\u2019ll kill you. And then I go, Ah, yes, back to it.\nReich: Yeah, I watch myself performing at the New York Renaissance faire. And let me just say, those are a bunch of incredibly fierce and talented performers.\nI was there last summer. It\u2019s a good time!\nReich: Incredibly talented, comedic improvisers, so good at thinking on their feet. Those long days, on your feet all day\u2014\nMulligan: Just hoping to get a callback \u2014 hoping to get a callback for the Orbit gum activation in Times Square, where me and 20 other improvisers will be paid $100 to receive 10 hours of abuse from real strangers on the street.\nReich: Dude, I did a month of background work on Third Watch, which was like the worst Law & Order.\nMulligan: I was a camera PA on Criminal Intent, which was the actual worst Law & Order! And it wasn\u2019t even during the Vincent D\u2019Onofrio episodes.\nReich: Oh my god. Didn\u2019t even have the pleasure of watching Vincent work.\nGoing back to your big anniversary announcement, I think a lot of folks will think, Oh, wow! Dropout\u2019s got a big anniversary announcement, is it going to be a new series? New content? Guest stars? and I can see a name change puzzling people. You give a great explanation in the announcement video, but in pure layman\u2019s terms, is this a big deal? I feel like a lot of your fans already know you guys as Dropout.\nReich: Yeah, we told ourselves we would do this when it felt most natural to do it. So in a way, it\u2019s not a big deal at all. And I think a piece of that, to your point, Susana, is intentional. More people who are active fans think of us as Dropout than CollegeHumor now, and this message is almost for everyone else. We do, in the back half of the video, race through a ton of new show announcements.\nDon\u2019t think I was going to ignore that, Sam!\nMulligan: I would say too, to Sam\u2019s point, I think internally, we\u2019re just \u201cus.\u201d We\u2019re a comedy company and we have enough glibness and irreverence to have a healthy sense of humor about something like a brand change, internally as a company. We\u2019re like, Yes, this is something that of course we\u2019re having fun with, and I think you can see the, like, tongue-in-cheek-ness in the video itself, which is super fun, but also very earnest celebration of all the amazing work that everybody that works on the platform has done.\nI would say, Susana, the obviousness of it is a testament to how tapped in you are. People that are very close to us feel in on the joke, people that are very close to us are like, Of course, I\u2019ve known that CollegeHumor was doing Dropout \u2014 I was there in 2018 when the thing launched. But I guarantee you every 18 months, some video creator will be like [in a salacious YouTube thumbnail voice] \u201cWhat happened to CollegeHumor?\u201d and the first 100 comments will be \u201cThey\u2019re the most healthy and sustainable they\u2019ve ever been as a company. What are you talking about?\u201d But that video will still go viral.\nSo there\u2019s a huge track of the mainstream that I think this actually is worth having an internal, well-made, funny statement about. Because it\u2019s definitely saturated our fan base, but my god, every time you go out \u2014 there\u2019s even a joke in the video about how your dad will still call us CollegeHumor. That\u2019s kind of an element of what\u2019s being spoken to.\nReich: The truth is \u2014 and we don\u2019t go into this at length in the video \u2014 we wanted to make the video even before we recognized that we were going to do the name change. We thought five years would be a good opportunity for us to do a little callback to our original announcement video, a kind of update. But we\u2019ve been wanting to do away with the name CollegeHumor almost since Dropout was first formed.\nThe name was \u201cDropout\u201d \u2014 as opposed to \u201cCollegeHumor Plus,\u201d or \u201cPro\u201d or whatever else it could have been \u2014 specifically because we were itching to distance ourselves from that brand name. It\u2019s been a blessing and a curse for a long time, the blessing being one of the few brands with quote-unquote \u201cstaying power\u201d on the internet, so it has recognizability with a few different generations. And the curse being... pretty self-explanatory. We could not be more distant from our frat-y roots at this point.\nYou got Whose Line Is It Anyway?\u2019s Wayne Brady on Make Some Noise this season, and in a Tumblr post you said he told you, \u201cThere are only two people doing taped improv correctly: us and you.\u201d If I said that Dropout is a notable part of the history of improv performance, both in shows like Make Some Noise and Game Changer \u2014 and Dimension 20, that is improvised performance \u2014 does that activate your impostor syndrome, or is that something that\u2019s been on your dream board for five years?\nReich: Every waking moment of my day activates my impostor syndrome. But at the same time, I love that sentiment. And I think some of that\u2019s been a happy accident. We set out with a lot of scripted content on Dropout, and it didn\u2019t really work. It\u2019s once we broke away from IAC that we started to do more unscripted stuff, simply because it was what was working on the platform. And I think it\u2019s allowed us really to explore the world of improv more than we ever thought we would get to. And Brennan I knew as a world-class improviser and comedic performer even before I knew he was a GM.\nBrennan just shot something for us as a part of a new show, that\u2019s an improv-based show, that\u2019s one of my favorite things I\u2019ve ever seen him do.\nMulligan: Aw, thanks, man. That\u2019s very kind.\nReich: And Brennan\u2019s been through [Upright Citizens Brigade], and I\u2019ve been through UCB, and so many of us have had this training. But Hollywood told us for years and years that there was no great way to capture this on film. And here we are. It\u2019s kind of serendipitous and magical.\nMulligan: Yeah. It\u2019s very special. The impostor syndrome is very real, but I find myself bouncing back and forth between the feeling of \u2014 When Wayne Brady says something like that, you sort of can\u2019t accept something that nice. So you deflect it away. But also, I feel like there\u2019s something that would be too glib and dismissive to not be cognizant about the incredible fortune that we\u2019ve had.\nIf you have a sober eye and look around at the entertainment landscape at other places that are able to celebrate improv and celebrate spontaneous comedy, whether on Game Changer or Make Some Noise and things that push the envelope and play with the form \u2014 or even, one of my favorite things to do with Dimension 20 is taking improv comedians, who their entire creative life has been around following game, comedic beats, very in that UCB sketch structure, and let them open their narrative wings and really dip into storytelling in a way they often don\u2019t get an opportunity to do on stage. So on the one hand, yes, very much impostor syndrome, and Oh, something that nice can\u2019t be true. And then on the other hand, I do recognize the rare air we are breathing with having a space like this, so that\u2019s really wonderful.\nI wasn\u2019t completely certain that you\u2019d slipped some stealth reveals into the announcement video, but I figured it was pretty likely. Which of them are you most looking forward to? Or, do you have a favorite Easter egg snuck into the video?\nReich: OK, the one that Brennan did the episode of recently that I was wild about is a show we\u2019re calling Very Important People. And it\u2019s a reboot of something we did 12 or 13 years ago on CollegeHumor.\nMulligan: One of my favorite CollegeHumor things of all time when I was a fan at home watching CollegeHumor.\nReich: [And it was] called Hello My Name Is. And the format was that we would put, specifically Josh Ruben, in really ambitious makeup, and we would sit him down for a Charlie Rose-style interview in that character, which he would have only a minute to create. We rebooted that as Very Important People. Vic Michaelis is hosting, and the cast is this rotating cast of characters from our improv world and it\u2019s so... Every once in a while I get what I call the \u201cquality chills\u201d? I got quality chills while I was watching the Dungeons and Drag Queens shoot; this creepy-crawly sensation on your back like, This is really good. Because this is really good. A lot of quality chills.\nMulligan: Hell yeah.\nBrennan, do you have a favorite Easter egg from the video?\nReich: There are three seasons of Dimension 20 in that lineup of quick titles...\nMulligan: Do I have a favorite Easter egg? All I\u2019m gonna say is this: The bag of chips I eat in the video was a real bag of chips, and I really ate the whole bag by myself. So when you see me finish the bag on camera, I housed that whole bag of chips. And I don\u2019t want anyone to say that\u2019s movie magic. I don\u2019t want anyone to say that that was fake. That was an entire bag of Cool Ranch Doritos hidden in a Chompsky\u2019s bag that the art department made, and I put that whole thing to bed. I don\u2019t ask for much, but I\u2019m gonna good and goddamn get my credit: I ate the whole bag of chips, OK?\nReich: This is not an endorsement. The Chompsky\u2019s company does not confirm or deny that Chompsky\u2019s chips are in fact Cool Ranch Doritos.\n\nThis article, authored by Susana Polo, was published by Polygon on 2023-09-26 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":586}
{"title":"Jack Skellington turned legendary composer Danny Elfman into a weirdo rock star","context":"## Jack Skellington turned legendary composer Danny Elfman into a weirdo rock star\n\nThe last person in the world who thought Danny Elfman would play Coachella was Danny Elfman.\nBut in 2022, the legendary composer behind projects like Batman, Spider-Man, The Simpsons, and countless Tim Burton films took the desert stage, shirtless and ready to rip. Those who witnessed the spectacle of Elfman\u2019s performance were blown away \u2014 \u201cNobody else even came close to bringing that level of chaotic pageantry,\u201d wrote Vulture at the time \u2014 while images of the roaring composer were quick to go viral on social media.\nMost movie buffs knew Elfman as Burton\u2019s bespectacled, goth-adjacent music pal.\nThen, in 2022, most movie buffs did a double take. Wow, yes, that\u2019s frickin\u2019 Danny Elfman.\nElfman\u2019s rock turn may not have surprised those who were clicked into the alternative scene of the late 1970s and \u201980s; before he established his macabre staccato identity in Burton\u2019s Pee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands, Elfman was a member of new wave band Oingo Boingo, which hit its hardest with the 1985 single \u201cWeird Science\u201d (featured in the film of the same name). Founded by Danny\u2019s brother Richard, the band steadily toured and cut records through the early \u201990s. (In fact, members of the band still tour to this day.) When Elfman left the band to pivot to composing, he also left behind his live music career \u2014 for so long that many of his younger superhero-movie-watching\/Hot Topic-shopping devotees never knew his lineage. And even in the Oingo Boingo days, the musician wasn\u2019t going as hard as he did at Coachella.\nSo what brought him back? What rebirthed him as a man who could share a stage with Billie Eilish and Limp Bizkit\u2019s Wes Borland? To my mind, it\u2019s Henry Selick\u2019s The Nightmare Before Christmas. Produced by Burton, the stop-motion project was a black sheep for Walt Disney Animation that blossomed into a cult favorite, and based on the last few years in Elfman\u2019s life, a transformative milestone for a musician born to shred on a stage like no other rocker ever has.\nElfman joined Burton early on in the development of The Nightmare Before Christmas, plussing up the loose animation pitch into a musical worthy of the Disney Renaissance. And after recording demos for Jack Skellington\u2019s big numbers, Elfman became the obvious pick to record the final versions (while The Princess Bride\u2019s Chris Sarandon was hired to match Elfman\u2019s baritone vocals in the spoken dialogue). The rest is history: Elfman went on to win awards for his Nightmare work, and the soundtrack became a cross-holiday staple every October through December.\nElfman did not peak with Nightmare in 1993. His four Oscar nominations for Good Will Hunting, Men in Black, Big Fish, and Milk were all awarded in the years that followed, and his work has extended far beyond film over the decades. In 2005, he premiered the highly baroque Serenada Schizophrana, his first work composed specifically for concert orchestra. In 2008, he wrote the music for the American Ballet Theatre\u2019s Rabbit and Rogue ballet and in 2011 composed for Cirque Du Soleil\u2019s $100 million Iris show. But it\u2019s bops like \u201cThis Is Halloween\u201d and \u201cJack\u2019s Obsession\u201d that will be engraved on his future tombstone, and he\u2019s never been ashamed to play the hits \u2014 unlike Disney, which had no clue how to release the movie to an audience weaned on The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, but has since incorporated its parts into everything from theme parks to 3D re-releases to the Disney Dreamlight Valley sim. And unlike his film score work, The Nightmare Before Christmas gives him the chance to take the stage.\nIn 2013, the former Oingo Boingo frontman returned to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall to perform his scores from Tim Burton movies with a full orchestral backup. This included select numbers from The Nightmare Before Christmas, which he sang in full. The concert appearance was such a hit, Disney invited Elfman to appear alongside his co-stars Catherine O\u2019Hara (Sally) and Ken Page (Oogie Boogie) at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles for a night purely dedicated to The Nightmare Before Christmas. The concert was such a hit, the group has performed it on the regular every October \u2014 and will do so again this Halloween.\nThe hype around his various Burton and Nightmare Before Christmas concerts sparked the idea for Coachella programmers that Elfman could play alongside pop acts of the moment. As Elfman tells it, there was immediate and obvious hesitation on his part: He was not a rock star or a pop star or hip-hop star. But after watching Childish Gambino and Janelle Mon\u00e1e unleash pure theatrical mayhem at Coachella 2019, he saw his way in. The then-66-year-old began immediate work on a set that would blend his film music, Oingo Boingo hits, and experimental songs fit for a rowdy crowd.\nAs he put in a video for the music festival, \u201cComing out and doing something as myself, not as Jack [Skellington], was terrifying and exciting.\u201d\nCoachella 2020 was ultimately canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Elfman was purely activated and kept on creating. He released his new music as a studio album, Big Mess, and eventually took the Coachella stage in his now-notorious 2022 performance. As envisioned, the Elfman revue bounced from known tunes to weirdo grooves, all backed by animated graphics that paired well with, uh, extracurricular substances. But it was not a total upending of expectations; there was still room for Mr. Skellington at Coachella.\nIn a flurry of post-show interviews, Elfman comes off as rejuvenated. While the show hasn\u2019t realigned the trajectory of his career \u2014 he went on to score White Noise for director Noah Baumbach and continues to tour with his symphonic works \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine him shaking the moment in the spotlight. (This is where I want to flag that earlier this year, a Rolling Stone report uncovered a 2018 sexual misconduct lawsuit filed against the composer, which he settled out of court. Elfman has vehemently denied the accusations against him as \u201cvicious and wholly false.\u201d No additional accusations or investigations have come out in the wake of the story, and Disney and his longtime collaborators continue to work with him.)\nDuring the Coachella set, Elfman proclaimed that it was \u201cmy first time onstage as \u2018myself\u2019 in 27 years.\u201d He\u2019s likely referring to his time acting as Jack Skellington, though looking back, it doesn\u2019t seem like Elfman as the frontman of Oingo Boingo was his true \u201cself\u201d either. The act launched at Coachella is not a return to form. It is the final form.\nThere are few musical wanderers like Elfman, capable of swinging between genres and mediums and venues, and his time performing as Jack Skellington has everything to do with that elasticity. He is now unified \u2014 as a six-packed weirdo rock star with floppy red hair and body tattoos head-banging to the theme from The Simpsons.\nElfman has said at the time that there were no plans to tour his laser-lit Coachella act, although he busted it out earlier this year at the North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre in California. It seems entirely possible that Elfman\u2019s rock star persona will explode out of nowhere with the rhythm of his percussive scores. That seems like the best-case scenario for a musician who never wants to be defined, and is often trapped in the conventions of his business. A regular Jack Skellington.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story stated that Elfman performed at Royal Albert Hall in 2014. He performed his Music of Tim Burton concert in 2013. We\u2019ve edited the article to reflect this.\n\nThis article, authored by Matt Patches, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-13 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":587}
{"title":"USA vs Germany player ratings: USMNT defensive errors blight positive performance by Pulisic, Weah","context":"## USA vs Germany player ratings: USMNT defensive errors blight positive performance by Pulisic, Weah\n\nRENTSCHLER FIELD, HARTFORD \u2014 The United States appeared well positioned to fight with a European power through 45 minutes, but the house of cards came crashing down after the break as the U.S. men's national team succumbed to a 3-1 defeat to Germany in Hartford.\nPresented with a chance to test themselves against a world-class opponent on home soil, the U.S. entered the break level as a Christian Pulisic stunner was cancelled out by Ilkay Gundogan's poaching.\nYet after halftime, as Gio Reyna was withdrawn from his first start back under Gregg Berhalter to build his fitness, the U.S. midfield was overrun and the defense committed a multitude of errors to allow the Germans to gain full control of proceedings.\n\"It\u2019s frustrating because its just little moments,\" said U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner after the match. \"Little moments made a big difference at the World Cup, and it\u2019s kinda the same story here.\u201d\nThe Sporting News reviews how each USMNT player performed across the 90 minutes.\nMORE: Recap the 3-1 defeat for the USMNT against Germany in Hartford\nUSA player ratings vs Germany\nUSA starting lineup (4-3-3, right to left): 1. Turner (GK) \u2014 19. Scally, 4. Richards (Carter-Vickers, 66'), 13. Ream, 2. Dest \u2014 7. Reyna (de la Torre, 46'), 6. Musah, 8. McKennie (Cardoso, 75') \u2014 21. Weah (Aaronson, 66'), 20. Balogun (Pepi, 66'), 10. Pulisic (Paredes, 75').\nGK: Matt Turner \u2014 8\nThe only goal Matt Turner conceded in the first half came on a play Turner initially saved, before being slammed home by Ilkay Gundogan as the rest of the U.S. defense just stood there and watched.\nTurner made a host of excellent saves, and while Germany certainly didn't dazzle in the finishing department, he was a critical part of the U.S. performance as the defense melted in front of him. The second half was overwhelming for the U.S. back line, and Turner had little answer for the waves of pressure, but he still made a number of good stops, particularly just after the break with the game still level.\nA quality performance from the U.S. goalkeeper, although he could have done better to help marshal a totally scattered defensive line.\nMatt Turner says no \u274c\n\nWatch USA vs. Germany live on TNT or Max \ud83d\udcfa pic.twitter.com\/x2HslCk3s2 \u2014 B\/R Football (@brfootball) October 14, 2023\nRB: Joe Scally \u2014 6\nJoe Scally was tidy in possession, and while he offered very little in the attack, that was largely by design as they didn't need him on that right side with Tim Weah cooking.\nScally defended ok, and wasn't guilty of any big mistakes, which is more than most of the other U.S. defenders can say. It wasn't a standout performance by any means, and the whole back line has some soul searching to do, but others were far more culpable than the Borussia Monchengladbach man.\nCB: Chris Richards \u2014 4\nStatistically, Chris Richards had a pretty good match, missing with just one pass of his 42 attempted and not being beaten at any point by any German attackers. Yet his lack of volume speaks... well, volumes.\nRichards was off the pace for much of his 65 minutes, and failed to get involved as his teammates were beaten repeatedly on the dribble. It was Richards' positioning that let him down, and he should have been more involved with the U.S. under siege in such an open match.\nCB: Tim Ream \u2014 5\nChris Richards often left Tim Ream on an island, and the 36-year-old just could not cope with the waves of German attackers.\nThe third German goal was emblematic of this lack of chemistry between the two U.S. center-backs: Richards stepped up to guard a free Niklas Fullkrug who got by Sergino Dest, and Ream was unaware as that left Leroy Sane free on goal himself. These two just didn't have it, and Ream was powerless to pick up the slack.\nJamal Musiala dances through the USA defense and Germany lead 3-1 \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\n\nWatch USA vs. Germany live on TNT or Max \ud83d\udcfa pic.twitter.com\/PdjsjkObZR \u2014 B\/R Football (@brfootball) October 14, 2023\nLB: Sergino Dest \u2014 4\nIf it were possible to give Sergino Dest two different scores, one for the attacking half and one for the defensive half, we'd do it, but that's not how this works. Dest was lively up front as he combined with Christian Pulisic and worked very well on the ball. He got Mats Hummels booked on a counter-attack and delivered a few very quality crosses.\nDest was also guilty of some of the game's worst defensive errors. He was completely non-existent as Leroy Sane blazed by him on the first Germany goal, and he nearly got his team in trouble again right before halftime by holding onto the ball too long after making an interception rather than just clearing it out of danger. Filling in for Antonee Robinson at left-back rather than his natural right, Germany targeted him on multiple occasions, to great profit.\nHe had a few good moments guarding Leroy Sane in the second half, but he was a top culprit for Germany's second goal by playing Niklas Fullkrug onside. If the U.S. had profited more from his attacking presence the narrative around his performance might be different, but with the story of the match focused on the defensive errors, Dest is a guilty party.\nCM: Yunus Musah \u2014 6\nAnother player who did well in possession but struggled defensively, Yunus Musah dazzled at times on the ball but was beaten on the first Germany goal by whiffing with his slide.\nMusah's nutmeg of Florian Wirtz was a highlight moment of the match, and he was active on both ends of the pitch. Yet a few bad giveaways or defensive moments betrayed his usual stoutness in the middle of the pitch. Overall, the mistakes didn't take away from his performance quite as much as Dest's, but they were still concerning.\nCM: Weston McKennie \u2014 4\nOther than a pair of critical blocks right before halftime, Weston McKennie was a mess through the first 45 minutes. He was constantly unsure of where he should be as Germany built forward with incisive pace, and he was one of many U.S. players caught unaware on the first-half Ilkay Gundogan goal.\nMcKennie didn't put a first-half pass wrong, going 18\/18 before the break and 28\/30 overall, but his positioning was all wrong out of possession. McKennie was a sieve as the U.S. midfield was invisible defensively, leaving their defenders completely unshielded, particularly at the top of the penalty area.\nIt was only a matter of time before the floodgates opened, and that they did after halftime. McKennie was eventually withdrawn in what felt like one of Gregg Berhalter's only tactical substitutions of the match.\nCM: Gio Reyna \u2014 7\nIn his first 45 minutes of international football under Gregg Berhalter since the World Cup fallout, Gio Reyna was his usual self, drawing the attention of German defenders and proving visionary with his passing. He combined with Folarin Balogun on a number of occasions on the counter, which is a link-up that U.S. fans have been begging for more of.\nReyna was only fit for 45 minutes of play here as he returns from a leg injury, but it's no coincidence that Germany truly secured midfield dominance when he came off the field. A promising performance for the young playmaker who should head back to Borussia Dortmund after this international break with plenty of confidence moving forward.\nRW: Tim Weah \u2014 8\nThough Germany carved the U.S. defense to pieces, their attacking threat remained strong, and almost all the danger came from the wings. While Christian Pulisic starred on the left, Tim Weah was equally devastating down the right, dazzling with electric pace and good link-up.\nWeah's biggest moment came when he scorched Robin Gosens on the wing in the first half, knocking it past the German defender and then beating him with blistering speed to get back on the ball. Weah's statistical haul don't quite do him justice, but he was a threat throughout his 66 minutes of action.\nST: Folarin Balogun \u2014 7\nU.S. fans are salivating for Folarin Balogun to get more touches up front, and as Gregg Berhalter foreshadowed pre-match, they made a clear attempt to do that. Gio Reyna and Tim Weah did the most of the work in that regard,\nLW: Christian Pulisic \u2014 9\nThere's no doubting who remains the most electric and incisive U.S. player is, as Christian Pulisic once again backed up his nickname of 'Captain America'. The first half stunner was emblematic of his performance, but beyond that he constantly proved a threat to German's out-of-position right-back Jonathan Tah.\nPulisic completed 27 of 29 passes, a tidy haul for a player of his attacking intent, and created two chances in addition to getting the goal. His corners remain awful, and it's a wonder why he is still on duty for that role, but otherwise Pulisic was a menace.\nChristian Pulisic with an absolute banger \ud83d\ude80\n\nWatch USA vs. Germany live on TNT or Max \ud83d\udcfa pic.twitter.com\/G7t6KxLjFO \u2014 B\/R Football (@brfootball) October 14, 2023\nPlayer ratings for USMNT substitutes vs Germany\n45th min: Luca de la Torre \u2014 5\nBrought on to replace Gio Reyna at halftime, Luca de la Torre was unable to stem the German tide, despite being a more defensive-minded option than Reyna in what should have been a swap to shore up the midfield.\n65th min: Cameron Carter-Vickers \u2014 7\nWith Tim Ream and even Chris Richards struggling at various stages in this match, Cameron Carter-Vickers remains a top-tier center-back in this U.S. player pool and a clear starter when healthy. He came off the bench due to his recent hamstring troubles, but was stout in his 25 minutes of action.\nThe Celtic defender had 22 touches and gave away possession just two times, completing two dribbles and making two clearances. Carter-Vickers was not a target for Germany to attack nearly as much as the other three defenders on the pitch, a strong nod to his abilities.\n65th min: Brenden Aaronson \u2014 7\nProbably the the U.S. substitute to make the biggest impact, Brenden Aaronson was bright in the attack, dazzling with his dribbling skills and helping usher the U.S. forward amidst a second-half onslaught from Germany. A good showing from the Union Berlin winger who needs confidence at the moment.\n65th min: Ricardo Pepi \u2014 5\nIt wasn't an ideal situation for Ricardo Pepi to enter in, coming on with the U.S. shell-shocked from the quickfire Germany double. Still, he provided very little up front, with just eight touches in 24 minutes of action. He featured his usual pressing, and came close to scoring once on a messy chance that Germany just barely managed to clear, but otherwise he didn't quite cause the opposing back line problems to open spaces up for teammates.\n75th min: Johnny Cardoso \u2014 6\nJohnny Cardoso only had 15 minutes at the end to showcase his abilities, but it begged the question why he or Lennard Maloney weren't the ones introduced at halftime instead of Luca de la Torre. Cardoso lost possession just once in his 10 touches and completed a tackle, although he was also dribbled past a few times as well.\n75th min: Kevin Paredes \u2014 5\nWith 10 touches in his 15 minutes of action towards the end of a mucked up game of numerous substitutions, Kevin Paredes didn't stand out, losing possession four times and completing four passes. Tough to evaluate his time on the field, but he didn't stand out.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Bonn, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-14 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":588}

During the summer, he emerged as a favored MVP candidate. As the Nuggets maintain their key lineup for another championship bid, Jokic consistently demonstrates his game prowess.\nLuka Doncic: Doncic, among the preseason favorites for the past three years, has seen his prospects decline due to the Mavericks' limited support in Dallas, as underscored by their recent playoff absence. Although no one doubts Doncic's skills, questions about the Mavericks' contention capabilities persist.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo: Last season, Milwaukee's surprising first-round departure against the Heat was notably influenced by Antetokounmpo's absence for much of the series. The two-time MVP, arguably the league's premier two-way player, is poised to rebound next season. At 28, in his prime, his resolve is stronger than ever following the Bucks' premature playoff exit.\nJoel Embiid: Reigning MVP Embiid remains a prominent figure among top contenders. Despite the Sixers' playoff setbacks, he dominated the regular season, leading in scoring and showcasing superior rim defense. If he remains injury-free, Embiid is poised to vie for his MVP status again, hopefully with a strengthened supporting cast.\nHow to bet on the NBA MVP\nBetting on the NBA MVP has never been easier, thanks to the number of NBA betting sites and apps now available.

But when is the best time? That comes down to your tolerance for risk versus reward.\nThe odds are so favorable when the lines for NBA Most Valuable Player are first released because the oddsmakers, like you, have very little information to work with.\nThey are basing their odds on past performance and expected future accomplishments, as well as the quality of the team around the top candidates for the award. Thus, the odds are quite favorable.\nWhile waiting for more information, such as a player\u2019s performance during the regular season, the lines shift and become less favorable. That\u2019s because the oddsmakers are gathering information and applying new data and analytics to their lines to make them as accurate as possible.\nYou must decide which approach works best for your betting strategy as a bettor. Do you want to wager when the lines are released with little information at your disposal but the best potential return on your bet, or do you want to wait until you have more solid information to craft your MVP speculation?\nWho decides the NBA MVP winner?\nThe NBA MVP is selected annually by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters who vote for the players they believe are the best in the league.\nThis format, which started in 1980, sees each member of the panel vote for their top three players. Every first-place vote is worth five points, every second-place is worth three, and third-place is worth a single point.\nOne player rarely receives all of the first-place votes. That last happened in the 2015-16 season when Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors earned all possible first-place points.\nBecause there is no set criteria for awarding the regular-season NBA MVP, it\u2019s notoriously difficult to predict who will get the nod. There are often late-season shifts among the favorites, and there are even seasons in which the winner is considered an upset and more prominent players are snubbed.\nA recent history of NBA MVP winners\nHere is a list of the NBA MVPs since 2010.\nSeason Player Team 2022-23 Joel Embiid Philadelphia 76ers 2021-22 Nikola Joki\u0107 Denver Nuggets 2020-21 Nikola Joki\u0107 Denver Nuggets 2019-20 Giannis Antetokounmpo Milwaukee Bucks 2018-19 Giannis Antetokounmpo Milwaukee Bucks 2017-18 James Harden Houston Rockets 2016-17 Russell Westbrook Oklahoma City Thunder 2015-16 Steph Curry Golden State Warriors 2014-15 Steph Curry Golden State Warriors 2013-14 Kevin Durant Oklahoma City Thunder 2012-13 LeBron James Miami Heat 2011-12 LeBron James Miami Heat 2010-11 Derrick Rose Chicago Bulls\nWhat other NBA futures can I bet on?\nThe NBA MVP is far from the only NBA futures bet you can make. Here are some other popular NBA futures odds.\nThe NBA is the second-most popular sport in the US for betting, behind only the NFL. In turn, the bet types run deep.\nIn addition to pregame NBA betting lines such as moneylines, point spreads, and totals, you can bet on NBA player and team props, parlays, teasers, and more with legal and regulated online sportsbooks.\nNBA FAQ\nWhich player has the most MVP awards?\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar has the most-ever NBA MVP awards with six. He won three with the Milwaukee Bucks and three with the Los Angeles Lakers. Behind him, with five each, are Bill Russell (Boston Celtics) and Michael Jordan (Chicago Bulls).\nWhat is an NBA futures bet?\nFutures bets in any sport are wagers on an event usually weeks or months away. These are often settled at the end of a season or a tournament.\nWhere can I bet on the NBA MVP?\nEvery sports betting site will have NBA futures markets, including the NBA Most Valuable Player award, Rookie of the Year odds, regular-season win total OVER\/UNDER bets, and more.\n\nThis article, authored by Sam Eggleston, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-04 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":589}

Here\u2019s how to handle it, according to experts\n\nAttending meetings in pajama bottoms might seem like a job perk, but some remote workers have found that videoconferencing for work isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.\nIn the years since the COVID pandemic triggered a spike in telecommuting, many have complained of so-called \"Zoom fatigue.\"\nThought to be coined by Stanford University professor Jeremy Bailenson, the term refers to a level of exhaustion that comes with interacting with others on camera all throughout the day.\nREMOTE WORKERS RESIST MONDAY OFFICE HOURS, BUT BUILDING 'ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE' IS KEY, SAYS EXECUTIVE\nDr. Kyle Elliott, a tech career coach in San Francisco, defines Zoom fatigue as \"incessant tiredness or lack of energy as a result of spending a large quantity of time on Zoom.\"\nAdditional symptoms can include physical tension (including headaches, eye strain and stiffness), moodiness, a sense of disengagement or difficulty concentrating, according to Dr. Julia Corcoran, a licensed clinical psychologist and board-certified coach, who is currently serving as the director of clinical strategy and experience at Modern Health in San Francisco.\nThe challenge isn\u2019t exclusive to Zoom; other videoconferencing platforms can have the same effect.\nThe pandemic's effect\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, Zoom and other videoconferencing platforms \"exploded in popularity,\" said Dr. Carl Nassar, PhD, a professional counselor based in Denver, Colorado.\n\"We all found ourselves at home looking at the people we worked with, the people we went out for drinks with and the people in our extended family on a computer screen,\" he told Fox News Digital.\nWORKERS FIRED ON ZOOM: HERE'S HOW TO NAVIGATE A 'DEVASTATING' EXPERIENCE AND COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE\n\"Our work went virtual, our social life went virtual, our doctors' appointments went virtual, and even our intimate relationships sometimes went virtual,\" he said. \"And this meant a lot of time looking at each other on-screen instead of in person.\"\nLong after the pandemic, many of these habits have persisted.\n\"This video-ing of each other, it turns out, is far more tiring to humans than actually being together,\" said Nassar.\n\"One reason is that our brains are wired for actual in-person interactions, not wired for interactions on the screen.\"\nImpacts of Zoom fatigue\nWhile video calls can be convenient, Elliott warned that staring at a computer or phone screen for extended periods of time can result in negative mental health consequences .\n\"Zoom fatigue can aggravate stress, anxiety and burnout among workers,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"Our brains are wired for actual in-person interactions, not wired for interactions on the screen.\"\n\"Some people share that spending so much time interacting on screens makes it difficult to interact in real life.\"\nCAN YOU AVOID END-OF-THE-YEAR CAREER BURNOUT? JOB EXPERTS REVEAL SECRETS\nCorcoran agreed, noting that many report feeling livelier, happier and more active during in-person meetings.\n\"Because video platforms artificially limit our perspective, we miss the cues we\u2019re used to from live, in-person interactions,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"As social beings, we\u2019re highly attuned to these cues, and it takes more work for us to look for and process them in the virtual environment, leading to the fatigue we experience.\"\nEven beyond the workplace, Elliott noted that people are using video in more personal contexts than ever before, such as sharing reels on social media and calling loved ones on FaceTime.\n\"Because video platforms artificially limit our perspective, we miss the cues we\u2019re used to from live, in-person interactions.\"\n\"This can further exacerbate the problem if you're already spending a significant portion of your day on Zoom,\" he said.\n\"All these video-based calls can quickly lead to video fatigue if you're not mindful and take care to protect your mental health and well-being .\"\nStrategies that can help\nJust because a meeting is scheduled on Zoom or a similar video conferencing platform doesn't mean you need to be on video for the call, Elliott pointed out.\n\"When it makes sense, particularly if it's a large meeting where your input will be less frequent or nonexistent, you might opt to turn your video off from time to reduce Zoom fatigue,\" he advised.\nThe expert also recommended taking adequate breaks away from the computer, even if it's for just a few minutes, throughout the day.\n\"It can be tempting, but try to avoid looking at another screen, such as your phone, during this break, since you want to avoid swapping one digital toxin for another,\" Elliott said.\nFor those leading a video meeting, Corcoran suggested starting with a quick off-camera stretch break or mindfulness exercise to increase attention and focus.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"Whenever you\u2019re able, suggest audio-only meetings that don\u2019t require screens so people can do things they would naturally do in an in-person setting, like move around or look out a window,\" she advised.\n\"Walking away from our screens can reduce the urge to multitask, reduce eye fatigue and increase our capacity to move around.\"\nTurning off the self-view option can also be helpful, Corcoran said \u2014 \"it can be particularly distracting and draining because we\u2019re not used to seeing our own images so much.\"\nAs the use of video platforms is still relatively new for many professionals, Corcoran noted that the long-term effects aren\u2019t yet known.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"That being said, we know that constant feelings of fatigue, exhaustion and physical strain or tension do correlate with negative mental health outcomes,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s important to take steps to reduce Zoom fatigue before it leads to things like chronic stress or burnout.\"\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-12-01 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":590}
{"title":"The best tabletop RPGs we played in 2023","context":"## The best tabletop RPGs we played in 2023\n\nAfter more than a decade of going on and on about the \u201cboard gaming renaissance,\u201d it\u2019s safe to say that tabletop role-play is finally having its moment in the spotlight. But while Dungeons & Dragons\u2019 OGL fiasco has clearly lit a fire under many players eager to make a change, the fact of the matter is that a sizeable cohort of writers and designers have been toiling away at excellent games for years now. Their tireless efforts have yielded a bumper crop of excellent, some might say genre-defining, TTRPGs. Just like board games, a few modern classics have also cropped up: Look no further than The Quiet Year and The One Ring, both making their second appearance on this list.\nJust as before, Polygon asked nearly two dozen writers, designers, presenters, actors, and personalities from around the world of tabletop gaming to share with our readers the TTRPGs that made an impact on them and their players this year. Here\u2019s what we found.\nCity of Winter\nLinda Codega, Ennie Award-winning entertainment journalist\nMy friends and I still talk about the weekend we spent playing City of Winter. With lightweight rules but a heavy emphasis on the kind of ephemera usually reserved for much crunchier games, creating space for this game is almost as important as who you chose to play it with. Characters travel along a cloth map that illustrates a landscape with only barest indications of topography; the focus instead relies on themes of assimilation, diaspora, and \u2014 most importantly to the narrative \u2014 baggage. As a family of immigrants (bound by blood or by choice), players describe their home, their traditions, and then, as a darkness comes from the west side of the map, they leave it all behind, choosing what traditions and rituals they pick up from the places they visit and what they hold on to from their homeland. As far as games go, there are probably very few out there that require such a strict fidelity to the road laid out before you, but City of Winter uses this structure to facilitate the kind of deeply resonant character arcs and development that many role-players crave in their games. An astoundingly complex game, bringing your best stories to the table will leave you with a sense of loss and belonging that seem to walk together, hand in hand.\nDead After Dinner\nJason Morningstar, owner, creative director, and lead designer at Bully Pulpit Games\nJenn Martin\u2019s game Dead After Dinner combines the relentless procedural revelation of For the Queen with Knives Out-style murder mystery, and it is endlessly hilarious. Everyone is part of a miserable family stuffed with resentment, somebody is getting killed, there will be uncomfortable questions, and a murderer will definitely be revealed. Or will they? Dead After Dinner is a truly pick-up-and-play murder mystery that will delight you and your scenery-chewing friends.\nDesperation\nTim Hutchings, game designer and academic\nThe best game I\u2019ve played this year is a tie between Desperation by Jason Morningstar and Orestes\u2019 Choice by Susanne Vejdemo. Desperation is a card-driven TTRPG with a marvelous mechanic: Players draw a card with a bit of spoken text on it and then assign those words to one of the characters in play. It is so dang smart and makes for rich yet tight storytelling as the cards force new contexts for the actions of the characters.\nThe game comes with two dark American Gothic-flavored scenarios: a starving Kansas town locked in a brutal winter and a cursed fishing boat lost in the north Pacific. The faux woodcuts by Jabari Weathers and Brennen Reece are wonderful to look upon and convey the game\u2019s tone as much as the flavorful card text.\nMy best game experience was Orestes\u2019 Choice, a LARP by Susanne Vejdemo. It\u2019s the first heavy-duty chamber LARP I\u2019ve played since the pandemic; it reset my brain and helped me remember what I value in play. Players continuously swap roles as they play through a very queer Greek myth in which young Orestes returns home and must decide whether to kill his treacherous mother and father-in-law. Never have I planned a murder with such erotically charged practice stabbing.\nDungeon Crawl Classics\nThilo Graf of AAW Games\nI run and play a ton of different RPG systems, but precious few have had such a tremendous and lasting impact on my design and games as Dungeon Crawl Classics by Goodman Games.\nWith aesthetics influenced by all-time greats like Leiber and Moorcock, volatile magic, a relatively flat power curve for a d20-based game, and an emphasis on the skill of the players, as opposed to primarily rewarding the crafting of effective builds, DCC is a joy to run and play. It is not as much of a heroic power fantasy as D&D 5e or Pathfinder, but neither is it as minimalist as many old-school games. With fickle gods, mutating magics, lucky scoundrels, and ferocious fighters, DCC feels like playing through a Bal-Sagoth or Eternal Champion song. It\u2019s also easy to pick up if your group has any experience with D&D\u2019s third edition or Pathfinder. DCC rocks! Its focus on simple, impactful rules was a core design inspiration for the (almost system-neutral) Survivalist\u2019s Guide to Spelunking for 5e, a book I wrote with Douglas Niles and Stephen Yeardley. It warms my heart to know that DCC authors, judges, and players use the book as well!\nDungeons & Dragons\nMike Haracz, corporate R&D chef and host of Heroes\u2019 Feast\nI\u2019m lucky enough to be in the seventh year of a homebrew Dungeons & Dragons campaign, one I play with friends locally in the Chicagoland area. Our campaign is called The Heartsguard Saga, and it\u2019s based off Deven Rue\u2019s map of a place called Euphoros. My players are at around level 15 and I frequently give them a variety of amazing and unique gear that I\u2019ve dreamed up all on my own... which they go on to forget they have, and never use. We used to play in person, but since the pandemic I run the game virtually online from my house. I put a camera hovering over my gaming mat, and make a labeled grid for the players so they call out, \u201cMove me from A5 to B10.\u201d During important rolls, I even make my players face their camera toward their dice for added suspense!\nPetrana Radulovic, entertainment reporter\nI\u2019d wanted to play Dungeons & Dragons since I was in high school, but I never knew how to get into it. Thankfully, in the doldrums of 2020, someone I knew knew someone who knew someone (that\u2019s literally what the connection was) who was interested in running a game. That kicked off my D&D career, but was this year that everything finally clicked in my brain and it went from a hobby I enjoyed to one that I spend every free minute of my spare time thinking about.\nPart of it is finally having reliable groups. After some initial shuffling of members, in 2023 I\u2019ve been blessed to have not one but two separate D&D groups, both with enthusiastic members who are committed to at least trying to meet regularly. And yes, part of it is Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, which helped me to understand some of the more complicated D&D mechanics and just generally made me very excited about combat in a way I never was before.\nI\u2019ve still yet to actually have a game in person! My groups are spread out across North America, but I\u2019m hoping to manifest an in-person session soon. Here\u2019s to 2024 being an even better D&D year for me.\nEating Oranges in the Shower\nSam Dunnewold, Dice Exploder podcast\nThe Golden Cobra challenge is always a deep well of exciting (and free!) new larps from the bleeding edge of the hobby. This year, like a song that\u2019s stuck in my head, I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about Eating Oranges in the Shower by Hazel Anneke Dixon, a game about exactly what it sounds like. You play as members of a group chat who discover the \/r\/ShowerOrange subreddit, a real community dedicated to the \u201cliberating\u201d act of eating an orange while taking a shower. You each decide to try this out for yourself before returning to compare notes, and because it\u2019s a LARP, you actually go do the thing.\nThis game is so strange and delightful, not to mention delicious. The principal act is compelling on its own. It feels forbidden somehow, even as it\u2019s obviously harmless.\nBut Dixon also captures something ephemeral and nostalgic about what it\u2019s like to be in a niche online community and group chat, and the magic of making discoveries in those spaces. On an increasingly centralized internet, that experience has become rare, and I miss it.\nExquisite Biome\nEverest Pipkin, game and software developer\nI\u2019ve heard Exquisite Biome described as \u201cSpore for the kitchen table,\u201d and if that isn\u2019t a great pitch I don\u2019t know what is.\nComing from Caro Asercion (game designer) and Si Sweetman (illustrator), Exquisite Biome is in the world-building TTRPG tradition, but it focuses specifically on ecological biomes and the creatures that populate them. Through short generative prompts tied to a deck of playing cards, you build and witness the lives of animals far beyond the edge of our own world. Playing Exquisite Biome feels a little bit like being David Attenborough on an alien planet.\nWith beautiful, evocative art and short, easy-to-parse rules, Exquisite Biome is my go-to \u201cwhat if we made up some weird little guys and set them in motion for an hour\u201d game. And truly, what higher calling is there?\nFetch My Blade\nDid you know you can play one of the best tabletop RPGs whenever you want, without any scheduling nightmares or unfeasible time commitments? You can when you play Fetch My Blade, a solo journaling role-playing game created by Kelly Tran and Ethan Yen!\nIn Fetch My Blade, you role-play as a friendly or fierce dog of a retired legendary sword master. Create your character by choosing one of six dog breeds, including shih tzu, corgi, mastiff, border collie, husky, and chihuahua, or select your own! Determine three truths about your master and aid them when a mysterious stranger challenges them to a duel. It is up to you to go on a perilous quest of your own to retrieve your master\u2019s fabled weapon in time for their final duel.\nThroughout this transformational quest, you use three six-sided dice to resolve mechanics for racing against time, overcoming treacherous encounters, and uncovering new truths about your master\u2019s shrouded past. Embrace your inner doggy, buy this 17-page game, and begin your adventure today! Swiftly now \u2014 your master\u2019s fate is in your paws!\nHome\nWesley \u201cNox\u201d Crowe, aka Noxweiler Berf, creative director for Hunters Entertainment\nDoug Levandowski and Yeonsoo Julian Kim\u2019s Home drew me in immediately, and has been one of my most recommended tabletop role-playing games. If you know me or my work, then the fact that it\u2019s a horror game probably won\u2019t come as much of a surprise. It\u2019s a haunted house exploration simulator that can be played with a full table of players or alone as a solo journaling experience. It uses custom tarot cards and a whiteboard to track your character\u2019s progress as they dare to shine a light on the chilling danger of a variety of potential scenarios full of ghosts and other dark entities.\n\u200bThe action is propelled through the use of the custom tarot cards \u2014 the Night Deck \u2014 which are filled with prompts that require the creative interaction of players. Each round, players take turn as the director of the story and guide the narrative forward using the guidance of the cards to describe and draw each room of the haunted house that they are exploring. The game encourages collaboration in determining the story\u2019s direction and does a remarkable job of steering the action forward without a single game master putting forth the often large amount of preparation that role-playing games usually require.\n\u200bAs the game progresses, characters collect wounds and push past the terrors that await them and work together to resolve the mysteries at the root of each horror. The solo mode of the game plays just as smoothly as the group experience, leaning on the prompts and player\u2019s imagination to create a journal documenting the character\u2019s harrowing encounter.\nI can\u2019t recommend it enough. Grab a copy of the PDF, turn down the lights, and start mapping your own haunted house!\nThe Luminant Age\nI became an immediate fan of Luminant Age after being invited to be a contributor. What caught my eye at the start was the Four Humanities ancestries named Blood, Clay, Silk, and Horn. This year, many of my Thursday mornings have been a whirlwind of weird as our playtest party encounter teleporting flickrats, heal via esseweaving, and get hunted down by cultists in stryx bonemasques. The city we\u2019re in, Ourichor, is built on giant oil-rig-like platforms in the open ocean. There are no sun nor stars, but three moons... that you\u2019re allowed to see.\nAlso, did I mention the predominant religion featured, the Angelites, memorialize their dead by preserving their eyeballs? You can even wear them as mourning jewelry.\nThis Pathfinder 2nd edition-compatible setting has been as enchantingly addictive as the fictional ichor that propelled Ourichor into the renaissance era that the project is named after. While there are only two exquisitely illustrated supplements on creatures and equipment available currently, I recommend those with a love of the unusual to keep an eye out for more in the years to come, such as the upcoming Paragons of Luminant Age that introduces NPCs and explores their motives through the four moons.\nMarvel Multiverse Role-playing Game\nAs a role-player, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking for a good lightweight superhero RPG. I\u2019ve tried quite a few but had yet to find one that really hit the mark for me until I tried Marvel Multiverse Role-playing Game. I have to say, I was initially dubious about this game but it has blown me out of the water. The game is utterly devoted to giving the players the feeling of playing a hero in the Marvel universe with tons of cool powers and power categories based on key Marvel heroes like Spider-Man and the Hulk. The system is easy, streamlined, and really carries the four-color comic book flavor. Probably one of the coolest aspects of the game is that while there is an exhaustive list of Marvel heroes and villains at the back of the book, you can create your own hero with their own power set and use that \u201cbestiary\u201d of heroic and villainous figures as allies and enemies in your own heroic adventures. For those of us who\u2019ve always wanted to make their own X-Gene Mutant, Spirit of Vengeance, or Spidersona, this is a must-have book that will bring hours of enjoyment.\nMasks of the Masks\nSuperhero comics, for all their many flaws, remain my life\u2019s great passion. That\u2019s why, of all the games I\u2019ve played this year, the one I want to shout about from the rooftops is Masks of the Masks by Hazel Amber Goswick. The game is an incredible piece of art: a tabletop RPG presented as a fully illustrated comic book, an homage to Bronze Age superhero stories just as Watchmen did, that critically explores and examines the violence inherent in its medium. It\u2019s an absolute joy to behold as you flip through it; you can feel the love, consideration, and attention to detail dripping off of every move and every panel. Then, in play, it\u2019s a revelation; a brilliant blend of Belonging Outside Belonging and Powered by the Apocalypse that builds on some of the luminaries of both systems to create something that just sings. Plus, it has some of the most wicked advancement mechanics I\u2019ve run into in years, that both add to the play experience while heightening the ever-looming sense of dread and tragedy that\u2019s so essential to comics of that time period. Cannot recommend enough.\nThe Monster Overhaul\nThe Monster Overhaul, by Skerples, reimagines not just the monsters, but the very notion of what a bestiary can and should be. The book is divided into 20 categories, each containing 10 critters that hew to a theme. The categories are unusual: There is \u201cDragons,\u201d of course, but also \u201cSummer\u201d and \u201cA Wizard Did It.\u201d \u201cSummer\u201d monsters include the Froghemoth and Pyromancers. Some of these may sound similar to classic D&D monsters, others are entirely new. Tables galore help build and flesh out encounters. \u201cSummer\u201d has a set of generic swamp hexes; other entries have lairs and dungeons. There is an entire flowchart table for populating a megadungeon. Every page of this book is designed to make the reader think about monsters, how to make them feel new, or to recontextualize them, or to simply subvert player expectations. Like all great RPG supplements, The Monster Overhaul not only offers answers for these questions and more, it also teaches the reader how to continue answering them long after these published tables and suggestions are exhausted. A monstrous achievement that should be on every GM\u2019s shelf.\nBonus: Reach of the Roach God\nReach of the Roach God is the hardcover high-watermark of A Thousand Thousand Islands (ATTI), a series of zines, that presents a system-agnostic setting inspired by the folklore of Southeast Asia. Odoyoq, the roach god, senses new ways it can insinuate itself into the lives of non-roachkind. The three schemes are presented as both traditional adventures and as collections of facts \u2014 about the setting, about the people living there and their motivations, about the desires of the god and the machinations of its agents. Events will quickly throw a small village, a monastery, and a necropolis into chaos. Two gazetteers and a sourcebook on the roaches follow, giving the GM ample material to expand the campaign. All this is wrapped in Munkao\u2019s fantastically disgusting artwork. His vistas and cultural portraits are gorgeous, but when he brings his talents to bear on feelers and chitin and filth, the results are revolting in the best possible way. Sadly, this is likely the final installment in the ATTI series and unlikely to be reprinted, so get this book while you can!\nMonsterhearts\nFiguring out what to talk about proved trickier than I expected. A lot of the things I played this year were playtests or previews for things not out yet, which would feel more like a humblebrag than a recommendation, or were my own games which were great to play but would feel a bit weird and self-indulgent to suggest as the \u201cbest.\u201d\nA really pleasant TTRPG memory I had from this year was playing Monsterhearts for the first time in three years. This was one of the first games I ever played (for ages afterwards I kept calling playbooks in every game \u201cskins\u201d). I played a one-shot with some friends I was reconnecting with and we mostly group game mastered. We played a gang of messy screw-ups who didn\u2019t hugely get along, my character had traded her old gender to the fae over the summer, and we tried to investigate a potential monster hunter, a NPC most of our characters found too cool to talk to. There was a gag about someone doing a club remix of \u201cDanny Boy\u201d at a memorial service and the group chat with those friends is still named \u201cDanny Boyz (The Pipes, The Pipes).\u201d\nM\u00f6rk Borg\nJasmine Bhullar, writer, content creator, executive producer of DesiQuest\nOf the games I delved into this year, although several afforded hours of entertainment, I felt myself repeatedly returning to one in particular. Although M\u00f6rk Borg was released in 2020, it was only in 2023 that I happily stumbled upon it and was able to somehow get a table together to run a game. The book itself has a stunning and distinct art style that immediately transports you into the doom metal fantasy of the setting; but that\u2019s only a small part of its allure.\nUnlike many TTRPGs that one merely has aspirations of playing one day, M\u00f6rk Borg does everything in its power to make the game easy to run. Although it\u2019s a short read, no line is wasted. Even item descriptions are dripping with hints at nefarious deeds one must have done to acquire them. The optional classes are an absolute delight for those of us that savor the idea of playing the unsavory. From the esoteric introverts that choose to make their hovel far from prying eyes to the unfortunate discarded-at-birth cutthroats who\u2019ve had to scratch out a living any way they can, there is something for everyone. There is always the option of creating something more tailor-made if none of the classes are appealing, but I appreciate that M\u00f6rk Borg offers beginner-friendly ideas and archetypes to help you create something that fits right into the gritty setting. Furthermore, in the process of putting a game together, I found a glut of free online tools from dungeon generators to NPC character sheet generators that made game prep a breeze. I find myself coming back to this game again and again with each game session only giving me ideas for future campaigns. I know I\u2019m not alone in this feeling given the number of M\u00f6rk Borg-compatible games that have sprung up this year, from Pirate Borg to Chris Lockey\u2019s upcoming Abyss of Hallucinations.\nI\u2019m Sorry Did You Say Street Magic\nMadison Durham, writer and journalist, staff writer at Reviewed\nTo me, some of the most joyful moments in tabletop gaming come from the experience of creative collaboration \u2014 the magic of making something new with friends, be it a narrative, a character, a world, or in this case, a city. I\u2019m Sorry Did You Say Street Magic by Caro Asercion is a GM-less city-building game, played between a group of two to six people with a stack of index cards and your favorite writing utensils. The whimsically illustrated rulebook lays out the tools by which you\u2019ll lay bricks for your city, weaving together your ideas and your fellow players\u2019 to establish Landmarks, Residents, and Neighborhoods, all on a quest to find the city\u2019s true names. It\u2019s a beautifully simple game, guided by a Compass, which can be anything \u2014 literally. It\u2019s almost impossible for me to capture the magic of this game with words, because each session we played was so entirely unique, from the verdant turtle-city in the sky we built out in stages to the haunted shell of a city we later used as our D&D setting. It\u2019s a perfect game full stop, but especially for those seeking to rekindle their creativity, or simply to sit down and create with friends.\nTriangle Agency\n\u201cI laughed so hard my face hurt.\u201d \u2014me, 10 minutes after my first session of Triangle Agency\nI love a game with style and a clear, fun point of view, so I\u2019ve been a fan of Triangle Agency since I picked up its player guide in beta form earlier this year (to prep for writing a published adventure for the game). Written in the form of a cheerful, slightly threatening employee handbook, the Field Agent Manual guides you through the creation of your supernaturally powered character, then gets you ready for your role finding and containing Anomalies that threaten the nature of reality. After your team\u2019s morning meeting, of course.\nBeyond the style of the materials, though, playing the game was an absolute blast. The mix of mundane life, weird occurrences, and corporate BS created a fast-paced game experience that was playful and easy to understand (just count those threes!), got every player invested in our characters and each other (even in a group of total strangers), and allowed the whole table to lean into both the strange and ridiculous nature of life. This year, it was just the kind of joy that I needed.\n2023 was a personal tabletop gold mine. We finally got Brennan Lee Mulligan\u2019s first official 5e homebrew; I discovered tabletop meetup hub and game master meat market StartPlaying.Games, where you can, as I have, hire a handsome Scottish man to D&D dominate you and your friends every week; and I played a ton of my new favorite party game, As You \u2019Wich. It\u2019s a dead-simple hand-builder that, for me at least, boils down to convincing your nephews to eat disgusting sandwiches (hair, mustard, and broken glass on marble rye, absolutely not toasted). But the fresh grand dame of my tabletop world is Triangle Agency, a gleaming, razor-sharp new TTRPG that feels like a cross between The X-Files, Annihilation, and playing Control with the Robert Anton Wilson mod turned on.\nIn Triangle Agency, you are super-abled agents investigating and stopping ontological anomalies from destroying reality, with mechanics that feel like the platonic ideal mix of analytic crunch and grand narrative weirdness. And my god, it is gorgeous, with jaw-dropping art and design that puts it on the same shelf as Wanderhome and M\u00f6rk Borg. The full game ships early in 2024, but you can get the digital rules and start playing right now, for the low, low price of \u201cwhatever you think is appropriate.\u201d\nTwilight: 2000\nCharlie Hall, senior editor, tabletop\nI firmly believe that tabletop role-play should always take into account the audience that sits down at the table to play. That\u2019s part of the reason why I hate best-of lists for this particular category of games in particular. What difference does it make if something scores highly on some arbitrary rubric if it doesn\u2019t resonate with the people in your community? And so I look at year-end lists like these as a kind of menu, boards of fare that clever game masters can use to pick just the right flavor for a given table.\nFor me this year was all about reconnecting with the other dads in my neighborhood after years spent locked inside during the pandemic. I spun up a Discord that we used to organize friendly games of Call of Duty\u2019s DMZ mode, organized a few visits to the local brewery to catch up make new connections, and generally just tried to get awkward, middle-aged men accustomed to seeing each other socially again. One night I decided to bust out Twilight: 2000, and it was an instant hit.\nTwilight: 2000 is a game about surviving in the aftermath of a fictional nuclear conflict in the heart of Europe. It\u2019s an alternate history where the Cold War went hot, swallowing up an entire United States Marine division. Players take on the role of soldiers and other hangers-on just trying to make it out alive. The heady mix of dice-driven gunplay and a playing-card-style encounter creation makes it easy to run. But the fun begins even before that with character generation, which uses old school randomized tables to simulate an entire military career. If you\u2019re looking to get your video gaming buddies around the table for something that doesn\u2019t require a headset or shouting down pre-teens in a glitchy public lobby, the all-inclusive starter set comes highly recommended.\nProject ECCO\nIt\u2019s a near-impossible task to get a consistent group together, so solo TTRPGs have become my primary method of gaming. However, the barrier for me is finding a game with a balance of narrative and mechanics that isn\u2019t overwhelmingly crunchy, but also isn\u2019t open-ended to the point of choice paralysis. For me, Project ECCO found that balance.\nA story of time travel and cosmic horror, Project ECCO is easy to get into and relatively quick to play (three to 10 hours per game). Between the hundreds of narrative prompts, unlocking various time travel \u201cdevices\u201d (coins, dice, tarot cards, etc.), and the absolutely stunning layout, this is one of my favorite TTRPGs, period.\nPlayed in the pages of a yearly planner, Project ECCO hits every beat of a good time-travel story: time loops and timeline divergences, a shady and controlling Time Travel Agency, and an unknowable cosmic Entity consuming spacetime. As you play, you (literally) burn through the days of your planner, creating an artifact, marked and changed by the telling of your agent\u2019s story.\nFor an example of gameplay and a masterfully produced actual play, listen to the Project ECCO miniseason of My First Dungeon with game designer Elliot Davis.\nThe Quiet Year\nEm Friedman, associate professor of English at Auburn University and Polygon contributor\nLook, The Quiet Year appeared not once but twice on last year\u2019s roundup, I know. Jay Dragon praised its elegance and Keerthi Sridharan noted the way their game group used it as a prologue (as Friends at the Table and The Adventure Zone have popularized), and it\u2019s a standard early on in my TTPRG class. But for me it was the standout game of this year because after running it for my niece (then 4) and nephew (8), my nephew asked that I run \u201cthe skulls game\u201d for his entire class. While not intended for a dozen grade schoolers, it turns out the mechanics of The Quiet Year \u2014 which ensure everyone gets to have their turn unimpeded by the commentary of others, ritualizes dissent and discussion, as well as having a glorious sheet of blank paper to draw the zombie chicken monster friend of your dreams \u2014 turned out to be a perfect framework to imagine how to work together. All that, and it fits in my pocket.\nWhat Dust Remains\nDanny Quach, Digital Thiccness, TTRPG writer, designer, and performer\nDespite my generally sunny disposition, big smile, and boisterous laughter (as well as being deemed the internet\u2019s emotional support himbo), I love all of my emotions \u2014 the good, bad, and ugly. I love emo\/screamo\/post-hardcore music and exploring the darkness through lyrics. I love the gothic and macabre, finding comfort in losing something you once had. I love horror movies and the inherent queerness of being an outcast being pushed to their limits. And I love games that explore themes of melancholy and loss. Enter: What Dust Remains by 2022 Diana Jones Emerging Designer award winner Bianca Canoza \u2014 aka Momatoes. Taught by the designer herself, I got to play this at Big Bad Con 2023 with two other strangers who quickly became co-collaborators in this tragic world we built in under two hours that told a story of a legacy that wasn\u2019t quite within reach. Impassioned and intriguing card-prompted questions along with focused, intense moments of dice rolls that helped move the story along, What Dust Remains challenged me to discover, explore, and sit in moments of despair and desperation and had the whole table contemplating what parts of us are we going to sacrifice to leave a legacy that would be bigger than we could ever be behind.\nThe Wildsea\nEarlier this year, I searched for the perfect system to kickstart my new actual-play campaign with three \u201cmust-haves\u201d in mind: a vivid world, rich character options, and simple but punchy rules. Through sheer accident (providence?), I stumbled upon The Wildsea by Felix Isaacs and Mythworks \u2014 and it was love at first sight.\nIn this game, players embody wildsailors: swashbuckling adventurers who traverse a strange and vibrant world made of fantastical vegetation. The character generation process encourages delightfully bizarre concepts like pinwolf-taming sharpshooters trapped in amber, omen-speaking moth chefs, or even collections of a thousand spiders wearing skin suits. The mechanics are structured around a d6 dice pool system with bands of success that generate interesting outcomes no matter what you roll.\nThe beautifully illustrated rulebook not only allowed me to add my own twists, but actively endorsed it, with multiple sections dedicated to alternate ways of running encounters and ideas for creating your own unique lore. My players and I had an absolute BLAST playing The Wildsea both on and off stream, and we were stoked (but not surprised!) when it won an Ennie this year. If you\u2019re looking for a narratively focused game with an imaginative world and mechanics that inspire cinematic play, then give The Wildsea a shot!\n\nThis article, authored by Charlie Hall, was published by Polygon on 2023-12-13 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":591}
{"title":"Rogue Trader\u2019s role-playing embraces the brutality and freedom of Warhammer 40K","context":"## Rogue Trader\u2019s role-playing embraces the brutality and freedom of Warhammer 40K\n\n\u201cIn the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.\u201d That\u2019s the tagline of Warhammer 40,000, one of the most over-the-top and brutal sci-fi settings around. But even in a merciless, brutal dystopia that grinds its people into dust, some get to enjoy being on the top of the food chain. Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is about the perils and pleasures of being atop that particular hierarchy.\nRogue Traders in 40K are freelance explorers, scouting the far frontiers of the Imperium of Man. It\u2019s a risky career, but it comes with luxurious rewards: agency, freedom, power, and a giant flagship. As the player, I explore a system of the Imperium with a loyal crew of companions, making impactful choices and determining the fate of those around me.\nRogue Trader is a computer role-playing game in the vein of Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 or Pillars of Eternity. I create my custom protagonist, determining stats and bonuses based on my backstory, home world, and so on. I\u2019m then thrust into a high-pressure job interview as a potential heir to a Rogue Trader aboard her flagship. Little do we know that there\u2019s a coup in the works, and traitors aboard the ship. After a deadly struggle against heretics and demons, I ascend to the position of Rogue Trader. I\u2019m the captain now, and I get to decide how to run my ship.\nThis is a vast game, with tons of features you\u2019d expect from a CRPG \u2014 companions (each with their own narrative paths and conversation trees), top-down strategic combat, and branching choices that impact the world around you. I get to make choices all day \u2014 in fact, that\u2019s part of the gig of a Rogue Trader. Some are more important than others; whenever I get to specific points in the story, I can choose from one of three major paths. Dogmatic choices exult the God-Emperor and loathe the mutant and the witch, the Heretical options pursue corruptive power, and the Ionoclast path is the closest thing we have to modern-day \u201cgood guy\u201d morality.\nAfter the events of the tutorial, my beautiful voidship is run down and my staff is struggling. As the newly anointed Rogue Trader, I have to trek around the various planets of the Koronus Expanse to get a new Navigator, fix my ship up, and avoid any major diplomatic incidents with the locals. My voidship is the size of a modern city; I\u2019m as much a governor as a captain, and I have to manage the ship, its cargo, and its many occupants.\nIn the process of getting back on my feet, I uncover a nefarious cult and a deep conspiracy. It\u2019s not an easy job, but I\u2019m blessed with a handful of companions from the Imperium to help me out. I can call on them to unlock doors or perform other environmental checks, but they come most in handy in combat.\nWhen I meet opposition, it\u2019s deeply satisfying to control my troops in a turn-based battle. Each fight takes place on a grid; it\u2019s very similar to Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 or even XCOM 2. Some positions provide cover, while others are out in the open. Friendly fire is also a very real concern. An arc of auto-fire from a bolter, or a Navigator\u2019s third eye opening, can harm friend as well as foe. My Rogue Trader is a sniper, and she would be lost without her Senechal taking the front lines. There\u2019s a lot of firepower at my disposal, and it\u2019s mostly quite satisfying to use \u2014 even if I occasionally shred my poor Senechal with a devastating AOE.\nI can chat with the companions between battles, learning more about their pasts. Most of them have deep and dark secrets I can uncover with a little time or patience, and they have fascinating stories to tell. Abelard, my Senechal, is a guy who sucks morally but will back me to the absolute hilt. I grew to love hearing about his days in the Imperial Navy, and he was the one guy I felt like I could trust. Augusta, a Sister of Battle, starts as a one-note zealot, but cracks form in that facade when I learn about her past and doubts. Cassia and Pasqal both represent two sub-factions in 40K, and they have lots to share about the Navigators and Tech-Priests.\nMy absolute favorite companion is Marazhai Aezyrraesh, a dark space elf who feeds off the suffering of sentient beings. He\u2019s cruel, depraved, and an absolute hoot. Yes, he may flay a few too many people for my tastes, but he\u2019s the best companion to bring to a party.\nIn the grand scheme of things, this is one of the most complete and detailed explorations of the 40K universe you can find. The game is an homage to the Warhammer 40K RPGs from Fantasy Flight Games, including Rogue Trader and Dark Heresy. I spent years as a teenager and young adult poring over these sourcebooks (which Rogue Trader is inspired by), learning more about the tiny details of life in the Imperium. Developer Owlcat Games has paid the same attention to every detail of the Koronus Expanse. I delve into ancient facilities staffed by tech-priests of the Machine God, the hostile xenos city of Commorragh, or massive cities built to honor the God-Emperor of Mankind.\nI love the characters, the environments, the writing, the lore, and the flow of battles. But I have concerns with the game\u2019s pacing. By the end of the first chapter, I had leveled up 16 times. Each level offered marginal rewards, like being able to move slightly farther during the character\u2019s turn in combat or having a higher parry chance when being attacked. A slow drip-feed system means each level feels less important, and even though I\u2019m growing stronger, I don\u2019t get that sense of long-term satisfaction.\nIt\u2019s especially frustrating to hit a roadblock like the one at the end of Act 1, where an incredibly tough boss rolls out of nowhere and spanks my crew \u2014 and I can\u2019t leave to go grind experience somewhere else. I eventually found out a way to cheese the fight by focusing on my melee fighters\u2019 positioning, but it took far too long banging my head against the wall. The victory tasted like ash in my mouth after all that frustration.\nVoidship combat is another aspect that feels clunky and frustrating. Like the squad-based skirmishes, naval encounters are also turn-based, where positioning is ultra important. Space naval battles should feel tense, but instead, I\u2019m mostly annoyed at having to continually rotate my ship and set up my zones of attack. I wish I could delegate these annoyances to my Senechal \u2014 to delegate the duties of character leveling and ship combat, the better to appreciate all of the things Rogue Trader is doing so well.\nRogue Trader is a dense, vast game, and much of it has clearly been crafted with love for the expansive lore of the 40K canon. While there are small annoyances and clunky features along the way, the political intrigue, cast of characters, and moral choices have me hooked. For 40K fans, this is a rare treat \u2014 a game that digs past the heroic facade of bolters and battles and taps into the grimdark dystopia that makes this particular sci-fi setting so damn compelling.\nWarhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader will be released on Dec. 7 on Windows PC.

{"title":"Pebble, the Twitter alternative previously known as T2, is shutting down","context":"## Pebble, the Twitter alternative previously known as T2, is shutting down\n\nThe grip Twitter, now called X, has on the market may be stronger than some believed. Unfortunately, that\u2019s led to the first casualty among Twitter alternatives, as the startup Pebble (formerly T2), is shutting down. The would-be X rival had grown a small but engaged community on its microblogging service that aimed to dupe Twitter\u2019s features, from its verification systems to functionality like DMs. But the company says they\u2019ve run out of time to make Pebble happen \u2014 the app maxed out at 3,000 daily active users, out of 20,000 registered users. That daily user figure fell to 1,000 daily users following its rebranding from T2.\nIn part, the sizable competition coming from other Twitter rivals was to blame, says co-founder and CEO Gabor Cselle, who had exits to Google and Twitter prior to starting Pebble.\n\u201cI think the competitive landscape evolved faster than we had thought,\u201d he explains. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that quite as many people \u2014 established organizations and newcomers \u2014 would try to do the same thing that we were doing and in very similar ways.\u201d\nToday, the market for Twitter alternatives is a crowded one, to say the least. There are numerous services for consumers to try, including the open source-based platform Mastodon, a soon-to-be decentralized system from Bluesky, plus smaller startups like Spill, Spoutible and Post, as well as a new app from Meta called Instagram Threads.\nThen, of course, there\u2019s the X factor to consider. The default platform for short posts retains some pull, despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 new owner Elon Musk\u2019s antics. Though the company may not have yet succeeded from a business and financial perspective, it\u2019s been hard for others to duplicate its function as a breaking news platform and place for spirited debates.\n\u201cI think Threads and others have encountered this as well,\u201d adds Pebble co-founder and CTO Michael Greer, previously Discord engineering head. \u201cThe durability of the network effect of Twitter is stronger than anticipated,\u201d he says.\nDespite these challenges, Pebble initially had decent retention. By week four, it was seeing retention rates of 30%, in fact. Its invite list was also working, as 60% of people who received a Pebble invite converted to become users. In addition, some 10,000 users arrived at that list from early press, like TechCrunch\u2019s coverage of its first outside funding \u2014 a $1.1 million angel round that included investors like former Google VP Bradley Horowitz, Android co-founder Rich Miner and the former CEO of Wikipedia, Katherine Maher. Data from Similarweb indicates the Pebble website topped 99,300 visits last month, indicating repeat usage.\nThe company\u2019s hypothesis was that consumers were hungry for a Twitter alternative that prioritized trust, safety and moderation from the start. To that end, Pebble\u2019s founding team included co-founder Sarah Oh, Twitter\u2019s former human rights advisor.\nPebble continues to believe its approach to moderation was correct, even if it was not ultimately a factor in driving growth.\n\u201cWe came in with a particular angle: kinder, safer. Trust and safety. And I think our approach to moderation that we did have on the site did work,\u201d says Cselle, adding that Pebble didn\u2019t have some of the issues other federated platforms faced. For example, TechCrunch reported that Bluesky earlier this year had strained its relationship with Black users, as it failed to crack down on bigotry on the site. Later, users on Bluesky were even creating usernames with racial slurs, and yet the platform didn\u2019t issue a public apology. Pebble never faced any such controversies.\nBut it may have positioned itself a little too far into the \u201ckindness\u201d territory, the founders now believe.\n\u201cWe were really seized by people saying they wanted something that felt safer, where they could speak openly without dogpiling,\u201d says Oh. \u201cAnd so we were confident that was an important thing to hit. Are there other things that are equally important and a great user experience? Yes.\u201d\n\u201cTwitter is you have real people\u2026saying real things,\u201d Oh continues. \u201cAt the expense of using a word that\u2019s overused, \u2018authentic.\u2019 And our theory was always if you can create a space where people really feel like they can let down their hair, then you would get that authentic content. We didn\u2019t quite get there,\u201d she admits.\nCselle agrees, noting that, perhaps, Pebble should have opened up enough space for disagreement to happen, while still drawing a hard line on the most disagreeable parts of running a Twitter-like platform.\n\u201cI think we could have maybe moved a little bit further towards that,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nice things that are said on Pebble, but maybe not enough breaking news. Not enough conversation.\u201d\nThere were other things that may have hurt Pebble\u2019s traction, too, including its lack of a native mobile app. As T2, the startup prioritized building for the web to be agile and more flexible, but lost out on the opportunities for discovery driven by the app stores. Notes Greer, \u201cthat might have been a mistake.\u201d\nIn retrospect, Cselle also questions if the rebranding from T2 to Pebble may have been an issue.\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering if the Pebble rebrand had actually softened the value prop[position] because T2 just encapsulated it so much \u2014 that it was really duplicative [of Twitter],\u201d he says.\nLike most startup shutdowns, the answer as to \u201cwhy\u201d is not any one thing but a combination of factors. For Pebble, that\u2019s certainly true. It was a perfect storm of competition, X\u2019s continued traction, the lack of a native app, a brand that didn\u2019t resonate and a space that was maybe a little too safe to be as addictive and as fun as the original.\nWith Pebble\u2019s winddown, being announced to users today at 9 AM PT, early adopters will have the option of exporting their Pebble archive as a zip file that loads a mini web page showcasing all their old posts. Pebble won\u2019t be directing users back to X however, or any other social network.\nAs for where the founders will now hang out?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe LinkedIn,\u201d Cselle jokes.\nPebble is also returning a small amount of the funds left over to its investors, more as a courtesy to show financial responsibility. The Pebble website will be shut down on November 1st and there aren\u2019t further plans for the IP at this time.\nThe founders don\u2019t regret their experience building Pebble, even though it didn\u2019t turn out as they hoped, they said.\nSays Cselle, \u201cOne thing that I learned is that there\u2019s absolutely an audience that wants to see a new kind of Twitter-like platform built and will ask for the features that Twitter has.\u201d He suspects the team might stay together to work on something new after Pebble wraps, taking the learnings from Pebble with them. That includes better communicating to users what great content should look like on a platform, and how they can win.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection point in social media,\u201d says Oh. \u201cWe had one hypothesis with T2 and Pebble. It obviously didn\u2019t pan out the way that we wanted it to.

He encourages all of us to continue to look at the positives in life.\"\nThe ideal living donor for Lucas is someone with type O blood, aged 20 to 49, with a BMI below 30.\nChallenges facing pediatric transplants\nBeyond seeking a liver for their son, the Goellers are looking to raise awareness about the critical need for donors to help the more than 100,000 individuals on the organ donor list.\nChildren on transplant lists in the U.S. face three key challenges, Mazariegos said.\nTINA TURNER SUFFERED FROM KIDNEY DISEASE BEFORE HER DEATH: 'I HAVE PUT MYSELF IN GREAT DANGER'\n\"First, there is a great demand for life-saving transplants, and there are 10 times the number of adults on the liver transplant list as there are children,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"This creates a challenge to allocate the right or the best organ for the children who are waiting on the list.\"\nWhile Mazariegos noted that the allocation policy is slowly improving, it's still imperfect and doesn't always prioritize children appropriately.\nEach year, dozens of children in the U.S. die while awaiting a new liver.\nMazariegos is determined to eliminate this \"wait list mortality\" through the use of partial liver transplants. That's when either a living or deceased donor\u2019s liver is donated to two different recipients.\n\"Saving lives is not about competition \u2014 it\u2019s about collaboration.\"\nAnother challenge is that not all the centers in the country have the capacity to perform highly complex transplants like the one Lucas needs.\n\"We need to train centers across the country on the techniques that will allow them to transplant these children,\" Mazariegos said.\nBoth the Goeller family and the UPMC doctors stressed the importance of raising organ donor awareness so that more families register as organ donors.\nMazariegos noted that people need to be made aware of living donation, which is when donors give part of their liver to a recipient.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nIn 2018, UPMC started a learning network, the Starzl Network for Excellence in Pediatric Transplantation, in honor of Dr. Thomas Starzl, who is recognized as the father of transplantation.\n\"This is an effort to level the playing field and extend the expertise to centers that want to provide the same level of care their patients deserve.\"\nIn Pennsylvania alone , 18 children are waiting for liver transplants, while 300 children are on the list nationwide, Goeller pointed out.\n\"Life-saving donation is only possible through somebody else's love,\" she said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShe said she hopes \"this campaign will inspire others to keep the conversation going and keep talking about Lucas and about other children and adults who need transplants.\"\nShe added, \"Saving lives is not about competition \u2014 it\u2019s about collaboration. It\u2019s going to take more than a village to get this message across the entire world.\"\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-12-09 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":594}
{"title":"The best Prime Day deals on headphones for October 2023","context":"## The best Prime Day deals on headphones for October 2023\n\nEngadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nWe're into day two of Amazon's latest storewide sale for Amazon Prime members, Prime Big Deal Days, and there are still plenty of hefty discounts on headphones, earbuds and gaming headsets we recommend. We\u2019ve sorted through the best headphone deals of the October Prime Day event below, which include new lows on the AirPods Pro, Sony WF-1000XM5, Beats Studio Pro, Amazon Echo Buds and more. Just note that some, but not all, of the offers are only accessible if you subscribe to Prime.\nSony Prime Day headphone deals\nSony WH-1000XM4\nSony WH-1000XM4 $248 $348 Save $100 See at Amazon\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4 is back down to $248, which is $20 more than its all-time low but roughly $80 below its average street price. This is Sony\u2019s last-gen pair of wireless noise-cancelers, but it still delivers powerful ANC, 30-ish hours of battery life and a similarly rich feature set as the newer WH-1000XM5 (which isn't on sale as of this writing). Unlike its successor, it can also fold up for easier storage. It doesn\u2019t have the XM5\u2019s adaptive ANC system, however, and its mic quality isn\u2019t as clear. It\u2019s slightly heavier too, plus it sounds a bit boomier out of the box. But for less than $250, it remains a great value. We gave the XM4 a review score of 94 back in 2020.\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony WF-1000XM5 $278 $300 Save $22 See at Amazon\nThe in-ear Sony WF-1000XM5, meanwhile, are on sale for $278. That\u2019s only $20 off, but it marks the first discount we\u2019ve seen for the top pick in our wireless earbuds buying guide. We gave this true wireless pair a score of 87 earlier this year: Like Sony\u2019s over-ear models, it comes with a range of useful features, powerful noise cancellation and a warm yet detailed default sound. The design here is also much more agreeable than previous Sony earphones.\nSony LinkBuds S\nSony LinkBuds S $128 $200 Save $72 See at Amazon\nThe Sony LinkBuds S are on sale for $128, which is a price we\u2019ve seen in the past but still takes about $30 off the pair\u2019s average street price. We highlight the LinkBuds S as an honorable mention in our wireless earbuds guide, as we like its compact design, decent noise cancellation, handy bonus features and warm sound. It can\u2019t match the ANC strength or battery life of the WF-1000XM5, but it also costs a fair bit less, which helps.\nApple Prime Day headphone deals\nAirPods Pro\nApple AirPods Pro (USB-C) $189 $239 Save $50 See at Amazon\nThe USB-C version of Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro is down to $189, which is $60 off Apple\u2019s list price and a new low. The Lightning version is available for the same price. This is the \u201cbest for iOS\u201d pick in our buying guide. Both models still deliver strong ANC, a superb transparency mode and a pleasingly warm sound. They also come with a variety of Apple-specific features, including hands-free Siri access, Find My tracking and fast pairing with other Apple devices. A recent update added an \u201cAdaptive Audio\u201d mode that dynamically blends its ANC and transparency modes based on your surroundings, while the new USB-C model comes with improved dust resistance alongside the new charging port. That said, you really need to be committed to the Apple ecosystem to get the most out of this, and the six-hour battery life is just OK. We gave the AirPods Pro a score of 88 last year.\nApple AirPods (2nd Gen)\nApple AirPods (2nd Gen) $89 $129 Save $40 See at Amazon\nApple\u2019s second-gen AirPods, meanwhile, are back down to $89. That\u2019s $10 off their usual street price. We can\u2019t broadly recommend the base AirPods to most people these days, as their one-size-fits-all design won\u2019t work for everyone and there are better-sounding options for the money. However, if you\u2019re all-in on Apple devices and just want the usual AirPods perks in an unsealed design, this deal makes the pair a little more palatable.\nBeats Prime Day headphone deals\nBeats Studio Pro\nBeats Studio Pro $180 $350 Save $170 See at Amazon\nThe Beats Studio Pro is on sale for $180, which is a new low and a sizable $170 discount. We gave these wireless over-ears a review score of 81 in July: We can\u2019t recommend them over the top picks in our guide, but they offer a pleasant, even-handed sound, helpful ANC and the ability to stream higher-quality audio over a USB-C connection. Like most Beats headphones, they also play nice with Android. That said, multi-device pairing doesn\u2019t work with iOS, there\u2019s no wear detection and the mostly plastic design isn\u2019t super premium. But at this price, the Studio Pro could make sense if you really dig the Beats aesthetic.\nBeats Fit Pro\nBeats Fit Pro $160 $200 Save $40 See at Amazon\nThe Beats Fit Pro is down to $160, which is a price we\u2019ve seen multiple times in recent months but still takes $40 off the pair\u2019s MSRP. The Fit Pro is the \u201cbest for workouts\u201d pick in our wireless earbuds guide, as it offers most of the Apple-friendly perks you\u2019d get from a set of AirPods \u2014 Beats is a subsidiary of Apple \u2014 in a sportier, more stable design. Its punchy yet refined sound is a plus, and it uses physical control buttons instead of touch panels. However, it lacks multi-device pairing and wireless charging, and its ANC is a step down from the AirPods Pro. We gave the Fit Pro a review score of 87 in 2021.\nAnker Prime Day headphone deals\nSoundcore Space A40\nAnker Soundcore Space A40 $54 $100 Save $46 See at Amazon\nThe Anker Soundcore Space A40 is on sale for $54, which matches its all-time low and comes in $25 less than usual. The Space A40 is the top pick in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds, as it includes a host of features that belie its price: adaptive ANC, multi-device pairing, wireless charging, a transparency mode and up to 10 hours of battery life. Its audio quality and ANC aren\u2019t quite as powerful as more expensive pairs, but both are more than effective enough for the money. Unlike many budget wireless headphones, its default sound doesn\u2019t completely blow out the bass. Just note that its call quality is mediocre, and it lacks wear detection, so it won\u2019t auto-pause when you remove an earbud.\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC $80 $100 Save $20 See at Amazon\nThe Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC carry most of the same benefits as the Space A40 but use a \u201cstem\u201d design reminiscent of Apple\u2019s AirPods. They put a little more emphasis on the bass by default, but you can change that sound profile up with a few EQ tools in Anker\u2019s app. They also support wear detection. If you prefer this sort of form factor, the Liberty 4 NC is down to $80, which is a $20 discount and matches its lowest price to date.\nAnker Soundcore Space Q45\nAnker Soundcore Space Q45 $100 $150 Save $50 See at Amazon\nThe Anker Soundcore Space Q45 is on sale for $100, which is a $50 discount and an all-time low. While not as nice as most of the pricier models in this roundup, the Space Q45 is a fine value if you can\u2019t spend more than $100. Its adaptive ANC is better-than-average and can be set to a manual mode if needed, it supports multi-device pairing and its design is comfortable to wear for hours at a time. Sound quality is where the price is most evident, as it\u2019s a little too uneven in the treble, but its bass-heavy profile should work for fans of hip-hop and EDM. You can tweak the sound somewhat through the EQ tools in Anker\u2019s Soundcore app.\nAnker Soundcore Life Q30\nAnker Soundcore Life Q30 $56 $80 Save $24 See at Amazon\nIf you want a decent set of noise-canceling over-ears for as little as possible, the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 is also worth considering. It\u2019s now down to $56, which is $24 less than usual. This pair isn\u2019t built as well as the Space Q45, nor does it sound as nice out of the box, as it massively inflates the bass and degrades when ANC is active. Call quality is worse too. That said, it\u2019s comfortable, its battery can last more than 40 hours and the ANC itself is excellent for less than $60. You still get multi-device pairing and a customizable EQ as well.\nBose Prime Day headphone deals\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds II\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds II $199 $279 Save $80 See at Amazon\nThe Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II are available for $199, which is an all-time low and roughly $75 off their average street price. This pair has technically been replaced by Bose\u2019s new QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, which add a new spatial audio mode. That model isn\u2019t discounted as of this writing, however, and the two pairs are largely similar otherwise. The QC II\u2019s chief selling point is its ANC performance, which is still among the most powerful on the market. If that\u2019s your chief concern, saving $99 to buy the older pair may still make sense. Just note that it lacks multi-device pairing and wireless charging, and that its earpieces are on the bulky side. We gave the QC IIs a review score of 87 last year.\nBose QuietComfort 45\nBose QuietComfort 45 $229 $329 Save $100 See at Amazon\nAlong those lines, the Bose QuietComfort 45 are down to $229. That\u2019s $30 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked for these over-ears but still $80 below their average street price as of late. This is another noise-canceling set that Bose recently replaced, but the differences between the QC 45 and the new QuietComfort Headphones appear to be small, so the older model is worth a look when it\u2019s discounted like this. We gave the QC 45 a review score of 86 in 2021, and we still like its lightweight design, upper-tier ANC and easygoing sound. You can\u2019t manually adjust the intensity of the ANC, unlike the newer model, and Sony\u2019s XM5 and XM4 provide longer battery life and a more versatile feature set for those willing to pay up. But if that\u2019s not you, the QC 45 is a fine alternative at this price.\nSennheiser Prime Day headphone deals\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 $142 $280 Save $138 See at Amazon\nThe Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 is available for $142, which is a new low. This pair has normally retailed around $180 in recent months. This is the runner-up pick in our wireless earbuds guide, as Engadget\u2019s resident audio expert Billy Steele considers it the best-sounding true wireless pair he\u2019s tested. That warm yet customizable sound is joined by a solid adaptive ANC system, though Sennheiser\u2019s pair isn\u2019t as effective as the Sony WF-1000XM5 in that regard, nor does it have the same deep feature set.\nSennheiser HD560S\nSennheiser HD 560S $150 $229 Save $79 See at Amazon\nWe\u2019re mostly sticking to wireless headphones here since that\u2019s just the way the market has moved, but if you want a quality wired model, the Sennheiser HD 560S is worth a look at $150. While not an all-time low, that\u2019s about $35 below the pair\u2019s typical street price. We recommend the HD 560S in our guide to the best gaming headphones. Its open-back design lets in and leaks a ton of noise, but it sounds spacious, detailed and well-balanced, which makes it a treat for critical listening. It\u2019s comfortable to wear for extended periods as well. Just don\u2019t expect much in the way of deep sub-bass response.\nOther Prime Day wireless headphone deals\nAmazon Echo Buds (2023)\nAmazon Echo Buds (2023) $35 $50 Save $15 See at Amazon\nPrime members can get the latest Amazon Echo Buds for $35, which is $15 off and an all-time low. This is another pick in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. Specifically, the Echo Buds should appeal to those who prefer a more open design, one that lets in outside noise but doesn\u2019t insert directly into your ear canal. They can sound solid for the price with a bit of EQ tweaking, and they support features we don\u2019t often see for less than $50, such as wear detection and multipoint connectivity. They also have Alexa baked in, natch. Their IPX2 sweat-resistance rating isn\u2019t enough for workouts, and their five-ish hours of battery life is just average, but they\u2019re worth a look if you\u2019re on a tight budget and hate the feel of traditional in-ear headphones. We gave them a score of 77 earlier this year.\nShokz OpenRun Pro\nShokz OpenRun Pro $125 $180 Save $55 See at Amazon\nThe Shokz OpenRun Pro is down to $125 for Prime Big Deal Days, which is $25 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked but still $55 below its usual going rate. This is a recommended pair of bone conduction headphones, which means it hugs the side of your head and delivers sound by passing vibrations through your skull. (It\u2019s not as uncomfortable as it sounds.) The main benefit is that this leaves your ear canals completely open, so you can enjoy a playlist or podcast without being shut out from the outside world. The downside, usually, is that you don\u2019t get as full a sound as you would with a traditional pair. That\u2019ll still be the case here, but we\u2019ve found the OpenRun Pro to deliver more low-end depth than most of its peers. They\u2019re fairly comfy and get up to 10 hours of battery life beyond that.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro $120 $200 Save $80 See at Amazon\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro are on sale for $120, which is a new low and $80 off Google\u2019s list price. This is the \u201cbest for Android\u201d recommendation in our wireless earbuds guide, and it earned a review score of 87 last year. Its ANC and V-shaped sound profile aren\u2019t as superlative as our top picks, but they\u2019re fine, and the whole package integrates tightly with Google\u2019s line of Pixel phones. An upcoming firmware update promises improved call quality \u2014 one of our review\u2019s chief complaints \u2014 and the ability to automatically pause music when you\u2019re speaking, similar to what pairs from Sony and Apple offer. Those with smaller ear canals may find the fit to be tricky, though we had few issues with comfort in testing.\nJLab Go Air Pop\nJLab Go Air Pop $16 $25 Save $8 See at Amazon\nThe JLab Go Air Pop is down to $16.44 for Prime Big Deal Days, which is about $6 less than usual. We highlight this set in our budget wireless earbuds guide, as it gets you a compact shape, IPX4-rated water resistance, eight or so hours of battery life and a full set of functional touch controls for dirt cheap. Its boomy sound isn\u2019t exactly great, but it\u2019s serviceable, which is a victory when we\u2019re talking about $16 wireless earbuds. Plus, while it lacks a companion app, JLab bakes three EQ presets into the earbuds themselves.\nPrime Day gaming headset deals\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2 $35 $50 Save $15 See at Amazon\nThe top budget pick in our gaming headphones buying guide, the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2, is on sale for $35. That\u2019s just a modest $5 discount but matches the lowest price we\u2019ve seen. The Cloud Stinger 2 doesn\u2019t have the most balanced or detailed sound, but its V-shaped signature gives action scenes a nice level of impact, and its mic quality belies the dirt-cheap price. The design is comfortable too, though it\u2019s made from cheap-feeling plastic.\nHyperX Cloud Alpha\nHyperX Cloud Alpha $60 $100 Save $40 See at Amazon\nIf you\u2019re willing to pay a little more, the HyperX Cloud Alpha is another decent value at $60, which is $15 or so lower than its typical street price. We note this as an honorable mention in our guide: It\u2019s been around for a few years now, but it\u2019s comfortable, and its detachable mic is solid. It\u2019s better built than the Cloud Stinger 2 as well. At this price, they don\u2019t sound bad either, though an underemphasized treble means they aren\u2019t especially detailed.\nLogitech G535\nLogitech G535 $80 $130 Save $50 See at Amazon\nIf you\u2019re looking for a wireless headset, the Logitech G535 is back down to $80, which is about $25 below its average street price. This is an honorable mention in our gaming headsets guide, as we like its lightweight design, Bluetooth support and agreeable, relatively well-balanced sound. It forces you to crank the volume to reach a listenable level though, and its mic makes voices sound a little too thin. It also doesn't work with Xbox consoles. But if you really want a wireless gaming headset for less than $100, it\u2019s well worth a look.\nYour October Prime Day Shopping Guide: See all of our Prime Day coverage.

No friends. She won\u2019t even know if it\u2019s day or night. There\u2019s no light down there.

No party. No friends. She won\u2019t even know if it\u2019s day or night.\"\nBillboards with images of Israelis held hostage in Gaza will also appear in 1,500 other locations in 48 cities across the United States.\nIt\u2019s part of an effort to remind Americans that some 240 Israeli civilians, including children like Emily, were snatched from concerts, from their homes and even from their beds in a surprise attack by Hamas terrorists against unarmed civilian targets.\nBring Them Home Now, an organic volunteer group that came together in the hours after the attack, heads the international outreach effort.\nEmily, even at 9, is older than many of the hostages. The youngest was just 9 months old when snatched away as a trophy of terror.\nThomas Hand\u2019s suffering over the past 40 days has made international headlines. He was first told in the days after the terror attack that his little girl was dead.\nCHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE BY TERROR GROUP: \u2018BRING THEM HOME NOW\u2019 SAYS IT WON'T REST UNTIL ALL ARE RETURNED SAFELY\nHe said in one interview that he welcomed her death because it was better than her being held captive and tortured by Hamas.\nHe found out later that his daughter had been taken hostage by Hamas.\nEmily, \"just loved life and music,\" her father said. \"Beyonc\u00e9 is a favorite because Beyonc\u00e9 is a beautiful singer and a very good dancer. And so Emily would copy her.\"\n\"She had this gift that she could memorize movements, she could just memorize whole routines, and she would do it within a very short time.\"\nHer natural dancing talent was apparent to everyone in Be\u2019eri, not far from the border of Gaza.\n\"Every holiday they'd have performances of little kids and older kids, so she was always in it. But she was always there front and center because she would always remember the moves if the kids at the back didn't.\"\n\"Beyonc\u00e9 in particular is a favorite because Beyonc\u00e9 is a beautiful singer and a very good dancer \u2026 Emily would copy her.\"\nHand shared stories of his beautiful girl and the ugly circumstances of her abduction in an interview at Central Synagogue in Midtown Manhattan.\nHand himself is not Jewish.\nHe was born in Dublin, Ireland, and raised Roman Catholic before moving in 1992 to Israel \u2014 a nation he called a multicultural \"paradise\" up until Oct. 7.\nHe last saw Emily the night of Oct. 6 at dinner in the communal dining room of the kibbutz.\nShe asked after dinner if she could sleep over her friend\u2019s house.\nHe agreed and kissed her goodbye.\nISRAELI MOM RECOUNTS LAST CALL FROM TERRIFIED DAUGHTER AS \u2018BRING THEM HOME NOW\u2019 VOWS FIND HAMAS HOSTAGES\nInitial reports that Emily had been killed were later refuted by official accounts.\n\"We had an eyewitness seeing her being led away by the terrorists with her friend where she was doing a sleepover and the mother of that friend. So it's absolutely confirmed that she was taken away by the terrorists and is in the tunnels of Gaza now.\"\nEmily and the others in the family she was staying with hid, like many of the hostages taken from homes, in the household bomb shelters common in Israel. They're designed to protect Israeli citizens from frequent missile attacks.\nOfficials told Hand \"in all probability she's in Gaza because there was no blood in the bomb shelter and there was no blood in the house that matched Emily's DNA,\" he said.\nLife has been almost unbearable for him since that day.\nHand was described as \"fragile\" by one person working with family members of the Israeli hostages.\nHand spoke to Fox News Digital beside Michael Levy, whose brother Or was also taken hostage by terrorists.\nHand said he's lost about 18 pounds since his little girl was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\nThey were accompanied by Israeli mental health expert Dr. Ofrit Shapira-Berman.\n\"I'm Irish, so I have a couple of beers before I go to bed and that sets me off because I don't want to think,\" the father said. \"I wouldn't be able to sleep. I'm eating very little.

I always wanted an American hot dog, and I was full after that.\"\nHe's lost interest in news amid his own pain and the ongoing pain of the entire nation of Israel.\n\"I'm a refugee. I have no home to go back to.\"\n\"At first it was a morbid curiosity to maybe see Emily amongst it all. And then it was just too much. I couldn't watch it anymore. I don't watch the news. I don't watch these videos.\"\nHe\u2019s also been homeless since Be\u2019eri was savaged.\n\"I'm a refugee,\" he said. \"I have no home to go back to.\"\nThe community \"lost 112 murdered and so many, many more kidnapped\" among a population of about 1,200.\n\"Your whole community was devastated. Yeah, we\u2019re all refugees,\" he said. \"We\u2019re all living in various hotels all over the country.\"\nYehudit Weiss was one of the residents of Be\u2019eri taken hostage on Oct. 7. Israeli Defense Forces reported on Thursday that they found her body in a building adjacent to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, which Israel says Hamas had been using as a headquarters.\nHand expressed hope that the billboards going on display in Times Square on his daughter\u2019s birthday, and then around the U.S., will remind Americans of the ongoing terror and antisemitism suffered by Israeli families \u2014 and do so in a medium that can't be defaced or removed from public view amid ongoing anti-Israeli hatred.\n\"The great thing about these billboards is that these \u2014 I don\u2019t know what to call these people \u2014 won\u2019t be able to rip down the images,\" Hand said.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\"That\u2019s the one thing I can\u2019t understand.

He shouted out angrily, while the woman moved quickly down the sidewalk. She raised a hand behind her as if to mock the suffering father's pain.\n\"My daughter, she doesn't know if I was killed or kidnapped or somewhere else. She's in terror every day.\"\nFurther pain is still to come, Hand said, if and when the hostages return and find out loved ones have been killed and entire families massacred.\nHe's also haunted by the fear Emily has suffered since Oct. 7 and now here on what should be her joyous birthday celebration embraced by the love of their kibbutz.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"My daughter, she doesn't know if I was killed or kidnapped or somewhere else,\" Hand said.\n\"She's in terror every day.\"\nSydney Borchers and Brittany Kasko of Fox News Digital contributed reporting.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Lifestyle on 2023-11-17 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":596}

The good news: We watch it all so you don\u2019t have to. Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\nComedy can feel like an ignored genre in modern moviemaking.\nHorror\u2019s having a fantastic 2023. Thrillers come out on a weekly basis. Even action movies have had some stellar recent releases. But Hollywood has been in a comedic rut in recent years, with fewer and fewer notable releases from big studios.\nBut fear not, dear reader \u2014 we know how to find some good laughs. We\u2019ve compiled a list of the best comedy movies you can watch at home, scraping streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and HBO Max, as well as free services, to find the best of the best.\nWhether it\u2019s a romantic comedy that makes your heart sing while bringing out a smile or a gut-busting laugh-out-loud comedy, we have a variety of options sure to bring you laughter and brighten up your night.\nHere are our picks for the best comedy movies you can watch at home right now. If you\u2019re only looking for the best comedy movies on Netflix, we\u2019ve got you covered there, too. Our latest update to this list added The Road to El Dorado as an editor\u2019s pick.\nEditor\u2019s pick\nThe Road to El Dorado\nYear: 2000\n\ufeffRun time: 1hr 29m\nDirectors: Eric \u201cBibo\u201d Bergeron, Don Paul, Jeffrey Katzenberg\nCast: Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez\nThe Road to El Dorado came out at the wrong time.\nThe animated buddy comedy came out during the transition point between the Disney Renaissance and the eventual wave of crass CG movies ushered in by Shrek (what I\u2019ve dubbed the Beloved Failures era). But even though it failed spectacularly in theaters, home video turned it into a cult classic and a meme powerhouse. So many frames of the movie have been repurposed as reaction GIFs and meme templates, but while the vivid facial expressions and body movement of the animated characters certainly lends itself to memeable formats, the movie itself is truly hilarious.\nThe setup is already promising: two runaway con men from Spain somehow end up in South America, where the locals of El Dorado believe them to be gods. But the banter between pragmatic Tulio and idealistic Miguel is absolutely amazing, with Kline and Branagh slipping into an easy and comedic repartee (not to mention the shipping potential that comes from their married-couple-like banter). Toss in snarky Chel (Rosie Perez), a local who wants out of the city, and the trio is electric \u2014 and distinctly made up of morally gray lying characters, a rarity in that era of animation where heroes and princesses save the day.\nThe three of them attempt to leave El Dorado with buckets of gold, but first they must play along with the charade, which only gets them into increasingly ridiculous situations. They partake in local festivities, go 2-vs-15 in a sports game, and eventually have to defend El Dorado from Conquistador Hernan Cortez. With each impossible feat, the ragtag trio of schemers pulls it off again and again, heightening their antics and plans \u2014 all with excellent banter (and a banging Elton John soundtrack). \u2014 Petrana Radulovic\nThe Road to El Dorado is available to stream on Netflix.\nBook Club\nYear: 2018\nRun time: 1h 44m\nDirector: Bill Holderman\nCast: Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, Mary Steenburgen\nThis delightful and raunchy romantic comedy stars Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen as a group of best friends who have been a part of a long-standing book club. Each of them, though successful in their careers, are dealing with crises of life or love. When one of them picks Fifty Shades of Grey as the next book they\u2019ll all read together, it opens the group up in a lovely story of personal acceptance and self-realization, no matter what stage of life you find yourself in. \u2014PV\nBook Club is available to stream on Paramount Plus and FuboTV, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.\nCatherine Called Birdy\nYear: 2022\nRun time: 1h 48m\nDirector: Lena Dunham\nCast: Bella Ramsey, Andrew Scott, Billie Piper\nLena Dunham\u2019s adaptation of the beloved children\u2019s novel is an outstanding coming-of-age story that is the rare book-to-movie adaptation done right. It\u2019s a warm story about the difficulties of teenage girlhood and all the expectations that come with it in any era (but especially medieval times), anchored by excellent central performances from Bella Ramsey (Game of Thrones) and Andrew Scott (Fleabag).\nRamsey plays a young girl named Birdy, whose father (Scott) is attempting to arrange a marriage for her in order to save the family\u2019s finances. A strong-willed girl with a penchant for playfulness and mischief, Birdy is intent on disrupting her father\u2019s plans for her. The movie excels through its layered portrayals of Birdy and her father \u2014 neither is pure hero or pure villain, and Dunham complicates the book\u2019s portrayal of the two to much success.\nI put Catherine Called Birdy on one Saturday afternoon, expecting it to be enjoyable background fare while I played some games and did some work around the house. Instead, I was completely enthralled for all 108 minutes. It\u2019s one of the most delightful movies of the year, and I can not recommend it highly enough. \u2014PV\nCatherine Called Birdy is available to stream on Prime Video.\nCharade\nYear: 1963\nRun time: 1h 54m\nDirector: Stanley Donen\nCast: Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau\nThe heist at the center of Charade was successful years prior to the movie, and without realizing it, Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) has been living off the profits from her husband\u2019s crime. When he is suddenly murdered, she realizes she didn\u2019t really know anything about him \u2014 or, for that matter, the new man in her life, Peter Joshua (Cary Grant). To make matters worse, the remaining money is missing, and a lot of terrible people think Reggie knows where it is. As more people are pulled into the orbit of the money, it becomes less clear who, if anyone, Reggie can trust.\nHepburn and Grant, two famously talented and charming stars, are at their most charming and talented in Charade. In the span of a single scene, Hepburn might move from pragmatic to seductive to fearful with believable ease. Grant\u2019s initial discomfort with their age gap \u2014 25 years, a still-not-uncommon chasm in Hollywood \u2014 resulted in rewrites to the script to make clear that Reggie was pursuing him; it remains one of the few movies in which the gap is acknowledged and dealt with believably, rather than taken for granted. Their chemistry is immediate and undeniable; it\u2019s key in carrying off the film\u2019s snappy dialogue and mixture of flirtatious comedy, captivating mystery, and genuine thriller. It\u2019s His Girl Friday by way of Hitchcock. \u2014Jenna Stoeber\nCharade is available to stream on Prime Video, for free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy, or for free with ads on Vudu, The Roku Channel, Freevee, Tubi, and Pluto TV. It is also available for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.\nClueless\nYear: 1995\nRun time: 1h 37m\nDirector: Amy Heckerling\nCast: Alicia Silverstone, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd\nThere have been many adaptations of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma over the years \u2014 and many actresses taking on Jane Austen\u2019s self-proclaimed unlikable heroine. There\u2019s Gwyneth Paltrow in the pastel-swathed 1990s version who makes Emma haughty, yet lovable; Joanna Sotomura in the 2013 webseries Emma Approved turns the socialite into an ambitious, albeit misguided lifestyle guru; and more recently, Anya Taylor-Joy\u2019s rendition of the character gives her a piercing mean streak worthy of the original.\nAll these Emmas have their own merits, but sometimes the most memorable Emma isn\u2019t an Emma at all, but a Cher.\nClueless takes the general framework of Emma \u2014 a rich, bored young woman who just can\u2019t stop getting involved in everyone\u2019s business \u2014 and transports the story from Regency-era England to 1990s Beverly Hills. Emma is now Cher, played wonderfully by Alicia Silverstone, a chic, stylish, and popular high school student who thinks she knows what\u2019s best for everyone.\nThe beats of Jane Austen\u2019s original story still play out. Cher takes an unpopular new student under her wing and tries to set her up with a hot match that\u2019ll catapult her to social fame. All those matches end up being catastrophic failures. Cher goes too far and learns a bit about herself along the way. All of it is done with bright, bold 1990s fashion and slang, with iconic quotable lines and the very best that teen movies have to offer. Come for young Paul Rudd, stay for the sentiment that stories are timeless and that human traits transcend eras (and also Cher\u2019s digital closet). \u2014Petrana Radulovic\nClueless is available to stream on Paramount Plus or for free with ads on Pluto TV.\nComing to America\nYear: 1988\nRun time: 1h 56m\nDirector: John Landis\nCast: Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones\nEddie Murphy stars in the 1988 romantic comedy Coming to America as Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African country of Zamunda who, tired of his mother and father\u2019s meddling in his love life, journeys to the borough of Queens in New York City with his personal aide Semmi (Arsenio Hall) to search for a wife. Directed by John Landis and based on a story by Murphy, Coming to America is packed with endlessly quotable performances by Samuel L. Jackson, James Earl Jones, Louie Anderson, John Amos, and Murphy and Arsenio in multiple roles. The movie is an absolute riot front to back and an enduring classic for good reason: It\u2019s one of Murphy\u2019s finest films. \u2014Toussaint Egan\nComing to America is available to stream on Netflix, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.\nDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart\nYear: 2011\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 55m\nDirector: Johnnie To, Wai Ka-fai\nCast: Louis Koo, Daniel Wu, Gao Yuanyuan\nJohnnie To is one of our great modern directors, equally adept in hard-boiled triad crime dramas and light-hearted romantic comedies alike. 2011\u2019s Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart falls in the latter category, and is one of the many high marks of the Hong Kong director\u2019s legendary career. Fresh off the end of a long-term relationship, Chi-yan (Gao Yuanyuan) is an analyst for an investment bank who finds herself in the middle of a love triangle. On one side, there\u2019s Sean (Louis Koo), a CEO who works across the street from Chi-yan and yearns for her through the tall corporate glass windows that separate them. On the other, there\u2019s Kevin (the always-dreamy Daniel Wu), an alcoholic former architect who helps Chi-Yan move on and is inspired by her to start creating again. What follows is a sincere, funny, and truly charming romantic time. \u2014PV\nDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart is available to stream on Netflix.\nEega\nYear: 2012\nRun time: 2h 14m\nDirector: S.S. Rajamouli\nCast: Sudeepa, Nani, Samantha\nOne of the very best movies on Netflix, the logline for Eega will clue you in right away as to whether this movie is up your alley or not. A whirlwind slapstick comedy revenge thriller from the director of RRR and the Baahubali movies, Eega is about a man who is murdered by a romantic rival and reincarnated as a fly, teaming up with the woman he loves to exact revenge on the man who killed him. It\u2019s joyously fun and absolutely bonkers (complimentary), with exciting action sequences, groundbreaking visual effects, and plenty of laugh-out-loud jokes. Much to its benefit, the fly in Eega is completely silent, instead pushing director Rajamouli to employ some classic tricks from silent cinema for laughs and gasps alike. \u2014PV\nEega is available to stream on Netflix.\nThe Gold Rush\nYear: 1925\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 28m\nDirector: Charlie Chaplin\nCast: Charlie Chaplin, Georgia Hale, Mack Swain\nCharlie Chaplin\u2019s adventurous comedy is nearly 100 years old, and it absolutely still holds up for the modern sense of humor. In The Gold Rush, Chaplin\u2019s \u201cLittle Tramp\u201d is a prospector living on a shack in the middle of the Klondike. Extreme slapstick and farce ensue, as Little Tramp\u2019s blown by Canadian winds, stoops to eating a leather shoe for sustenance, and eventually performs his legendary fork dance. Chaplin \u2014 even more than the muscle icons of the 1980s \u2014 is the key DNA to modern action entertainment, and if you\u2019ve never seen one of his classics, The Gold Rush is a hilarious entry point. \u2014Matt Patches\nThe Gold Rush is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel or for free with ads on Freevee, Tubi, and Plex. It is also available for for digital rental or purchase on Amazon and Apple TV.\nI Married a Witch\nYear: 1942\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 16m\nDirector: Ren\u00e9 Clair\nCast: Fredric March, Veronica Lake, Robert Benchley\nRen\u00e9 Clair, who made his name in early French silent and sound cinema, spent a few years making movies in the U.S. during World War II. Among them is the exemplary black-and-white romantic comedy I Married a Witch, which stars the incomparable Veronica Lake as a witch who hopes to exact revenge on the descendant of the man who imprisoned her by making him fall in love with her.\nWhen two witches \u2014 Jennifer (Lake) and her father, Daniel (Cecil Kellaway) \u2014 are burned at the stake by Puritans in colonial Salem, they curse the man who denounced them. He and his descendants (all played by Fredric March) will be doomed to be unhappy in love, always marrying \u201cthe wrong woman.\u201d Jennifer and Daniel awake 270 years later, and she begins pursuing her target: Wallace Wooley, the latest descendant of the man that caused her execution and also a leading candidate for governor. Oh, and his wedding to the daughter of his top political supporter is tomorrow.\nWith costumes by the legendary Edith Head, charming practical effects (the two witches are represented by wisps of smoke before inhabiting bodies), and plenty of hilarious gags (there\u2019s a \u201cpopped maize\u201d vendor during the \u201cintermission\u201d of the witches\u2019 execution), I Married a Witch is a breezy 77 minutes of Classic Hollywood delight. \u2014PV\nI Married a Witch is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon and Apple TV.\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang\nYear: 2005\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 42m\nDirector: Shane Black\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang is, without a doubt, one of if not the funniest and most effortlessly cool movies I have ever seen. Partially based on Brett Halliday\u2019s 1941 novel Bodies Are Where You Find Them, Shane Black\u2019s neo-noir black comedy crime thriller stars Robert Downey Jr. as Harry Lockhart, a petty thief who, due to a series of extraordinary circumstances, is mistaken for an actor and whisked away from the back alleys of New York to the twinkling lights of Los Angeles for a screen test. While there, Harry inadvertently finds himself ensnared in a murder mystery involving his childhood crush (Michelle Monaghan), a sarcastic private detective (Val Kilmer), and a retired actor named (Corbin Bernsen) with a terrible secret to hide.\nRelentlessly meta, wickedly funny, and boasting one of the coolest opening title sequences of its time, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is the rough-and-tumble blueprint to Black\u2019s 2016 movie The Nice Guys, and by all degrees the better film of the two. \u2014TE\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang is available for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\nYear: 2004\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 58m\nDirector: Wes Anderson\nCast: Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett\nWes Anderson\u2019s eccentric 2004 ensemble comedy is dedicated to Jacques Cousteau and is a loving (and hilarious) homage to the legendary French oceanographer. Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is an oceanographer\/documentarian who loses his best friend to a shark attack while working on his project. Zissou sets out for his next project: to find and kill the shark, and film the whole thing.\nThe hilarious ensemble cast includes Anjelica Huston (Zissou\u2019s estranged wife who finances his projects), Willem Dafoe (an emotionally insecure German first mate), Owen Wilson (a Zissou super-fan who believes he is Zissou\u2019s son), and Jeff Goldblum (playing Zissou\u2019s rival, a more successful oceanographer). With an excellent soundtrack of Portuguese David Bowie covers by Brazilian singer-songwriter Seu Jorge and Anderson\u2019s typical attention to detail in composition, The Life Aquatic is a cinematic feast of the senses. \u2014PV\nThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is for free with a library card on Hoopla, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nLittle Monsters\nYear: 2019\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 34m\nDirector: Abe Forsythe\nCast: Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Alexander England, Josh Gad\nDirector Abe Forsythe\u2019s 2019 horror comedy Little Monsters stars Alexander England (Alien: Covenant) as Dave, a foul-mouthed and down-on-his-luck rock musician living with his sister and nephew after a rough breakup. Attempting to get on the good side of Miss Caroline (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), his nephew\u2019s kindergarten teacher, Dave agrees to come along and chaperone the class\u2019 field trip to a petting zoo. Unfortunately for them, the petting zoo sits right next to a U.S. Army base that happens to be experiencing a zombie outbreak. As the class finds itself cornered by the undead horde, Dave will have to help Miss Caroline to make sure everyone gets out alive. Can he win her heart, or at the very least grow as a person for the experience? We won\u2019t spoil it, but we will tell you Josh Gad gets attacked by zombies in the process. \u2014TE\nLittle Monsters is available to stream on Hulu.\nLove & Friendship\nYear: 2016\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 30m\nDirector: Whit Stillman\nCast: Kate Beckinsale, Xavier Samuel, Emma Greenwell\nWhit Stillman\u2019s uproarious adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Lady Susan stars Kate Beckinsale in one of her richest (and most hilarious) roles. Beckinsale plays Lady Susan, a young widow looking to secure appropriate matches for both her daughter (Morfydd Clark) and herself. Susan flirts and schemes her way throughout the movie to the delight of the audience and the frustration of her suitors and friends.\nLove & Friendship features terrific supporting turns by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny (as Susan\u2019s supportive best friend), Tom Bennett (playing a hilariously dense wealthy fool), and the rest of the cast, as well as Stillman\u2019s characteristic biting dialogue and an attention to detail in sets and costuming. But the whole thing is brought together by Beckinsale\u2019s transcendent performance, one of the more recent examples of how comedic roles get ignored during awards season. \u2014PV\nLove & Friendship is available to stream on Prime Video.\nMagic Mike and Magic Mike XXL\nYear: 2012 (Magic Mike); 2015 (Magic Mike XXL)\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 50m (Magic Mike); 1h 55m (Magic Mike XXL)\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh (Magic Mike); Gregory Jacobs (Magic Mike XXL)\nCast: Channing Tatum, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello\nTwo joyous celebrations of bodies in motion contained within working class stories of trying to Make It Work in the face of a grueling world? Pure excellence. Channing Tatum, Joe Manganiello, and the rest of the ensemble cast soar, and both movies contain unforgettable set-pieces sure to get you off your feet.\nSteven Soderbergh\u2019s Magic Mike is an excellent subversive rom-com, inverting many standard gender tropes in the genre. The follow-up, Magic Mike XXL, is even more rapturously joyous than the first, celebrating pleasure in its many forms (in this way, you could say it is like Hellraiser without the pain). XXL also doubles as a road trip movie and a \u201cthe crew gets back together for one last job\u201d movie. Also: Manganiello goes all out in a minimart dancing to \u201cI Want It That Way.\u201d Perfection, no notes. \u2014PV\nMagic Mike and Magic Mike XXL are available to stream for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nMoonstruck\nYear: 1987\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 41m\nDirector: Norman Jewison\nCast: Cher, Nicolas Cage, Vincent Gardenia\nThe joy is in the smaller moments in Moonstruck. A mother cooks an egg-in-a-hole for her daughter. An older couple trades barbs with each other before the conversation shifts on a dime to expressions of eternal love. An elderly man basks in the moonlight with his five adorable dogs.\nA widow (Cher) is convinced her ill-fated first marriage was doomed by bad luck after a hasty engagement and wedding. When a suitor (Danny Aiello) proposes, she accepts, but ends up falling for his estranged brother (Nicolas Cage) instead.\nWith warm sets that feel lived-in, loving depictions of food (the egg-in-a-hole has since been colloquially dubbed \u201cMoonstruck Eggs\u201d) and romance, hilarious family conversations (\u201cOld man, you give another plate of my food to those dogs, I\u2019m going to kick you till you\u2019re dead!\u201d), and complementary lead performances by an assured Cher and an intense Cage, Moonstruck is a touching, uproarious romantic comedy about superstition, love, and family. \u2014PV\nMoonstruck is available to stream for free with ads on Pluto TV, Tubi, and The Roku Channel, with a library card on Hoopla, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nMultiple Maniacs\nYear: 1970\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 31m\nDirector: John Waters\nCast: Divine, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce\nThe early transgressive comedies of John Waters have been anointed by Criterion as art, and one can only imagine what Waters circa 1970 would make of that. Multiple Maniacs, the provocateur\u2019s second film, is just batshit nutso, constructing a flimsy scenario in which Lady Divine (Waters\u2019 go-to collaborator) spirals out of control on a murder spree and her ex-lover (David Lochary) plots to kill her first with other members of Waters\u2019 Dreamlander acting troupe. In true Waters fashion, the plot is an excuse for bodily fluid expulsion, flamboyant performance, and a moment of backdoor penetration courtesy of a sacred religious object. Today, with scrutiny from every side of the ideological spectrum, it would be almost impossible to do what Waters pulled off back in the \u201970s. Criterion knew what it was doing preserving these jaw-dropping memories. \u2014MP\nMultiple Maniacs is available to stream on HBO Max and Criterion Channel, for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon and Google Play.\nThe Paper Tigers\nYear: 2020\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 48m\nDirector: Bao Tran (Tran Quoc Bao)\nCast: Alain Uy, Ron Yuan, Mykel Shannon Jenkins\nTran Quoc Bao\u2019s kung fu action comedy stars Alain Uy, Ron Yuan (Mulan), and Mykel Shannon Jenkins as the eponymous Paper Tigers: three former martial arts prodigies who, after a lifetime of strenuous training and hard fighting, have grown into beleaguered middle-aged nobodies. But when their master is murdered, the three swear an oath to avenge his memory and bring his killer to justice.

Plus One, from Pen15 writers Jeff Chan and Andrew Rhymer, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival before quietly settling into a place on streaming and has been largely overlooked. Don\u2019t miss it: Maya Erskine (Pen15) and Jack Quaid (The Boys) star as best buds who\u2019ve seen all of their friends get hitched and have become go-to plus ones for the endless marathon of nuptials. Formula works to the movie\u2019s advantage, finding sweet humor in modern situations and wringing Erskine and Quaid for every drip of charisma they have to offer. A gem that could easily been mistaken as product in our current era of rom-coms. \u2014MP\nPlus One is available to stream for free with a library card on Hoopla, for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nSingin\u2019 in the Rain\nYear: 1952\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 42m\nDirectors: Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen\nCast: Gene Kelly, Donald O\u2019Connor, Debbie Reynolds\nWhat is there to say about one of the most well-loved movies of all time? I\u2019ll tell you this: If Singin\u2019 in the Rain wasn\u2019t on this list, we wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs right.\nStanley Donen and Gene Kelly\u2019s timeless 1952 classic is as joyous and funny as you remember \u2014 Donald O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cMake \u2019Em Laugh\u201d bit will leave you in stitches \u2014 but it\u2019s probably a bit stranger, too. In addition to all the industry jokes and the contemplation on the addition of sound to movies, the 13-minute dream sequence \u201cBroadway Melody\u201d is absolutely hypnotizing. \u2014PV\nSingin\u2019 in the Rain is available to stream on Max, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nSpy\nYear: 2015\n\ufeffRun time: 2h\nDirector: Paul Feig\nCast: Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham\nAs the biggest blockbusters in the world have become more and more comedy-oriented, there\u2019s been less space for true comedies in theaters. Spy is the rare exception, and it\u2019s finally more broadly available to watch at home after its addition to the Max catalog.\nA sendup of espionage movies from director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Freaks and Geeks), it stars a pitch-perfect Melissa McCarthy as a desk worker for the CIA who is forced into active duty when her partner (Jude Law) is killed by the daughter of an arms dealer (Rose Byrne, who is positively delightful in this). Add in scene-stealing turns from Jason Statham as an overconfident Bond parody, Allison Janney as McCarthy\u2019s skeptical boss, and appearances by Bobby Cannavale, Peter Serafinowicz, and Miranda Hart, and you\u2019ve got a rollicking good time (with terrific action shot by Day Shift director J.J.

Hall\u2019s Lisa is a protective force in the lives of her girls, able to put on a brave face in front of them (and in support of them) even when the circumstances around them seem on the verge of a total spiral. Haley Lu Richardson (as the peppy Maci) and Shayna \u201cJunglepussy\u201d McHayle (as the no-nonsense Danyelle) stand out among the movie\u2019s many great supporting turns.\nFunny, heartwarming, and undeniably tangible in its ground-level depiction of a hectic workplace, Support the Girls is a movie about looking out for each other in a trying world. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \u2014PV\nSupport the Girls is available to stream on Prime Video, Hulu, The Criterion Channel, for free with a library card on Kanopy or Hoopla, for free with ads on The Roku Channel, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nTampopo\nYear: 1985\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 54m\nDirector: Juzo Itami\nCast: Tsutomu Yamazaki, Nobuko Miyamoto, K\u014dji Yakusho\nThis 1985 \u201cramen western\u201d is a hilarious romp that also happens to be one of the most gorgeous depictions of food ever put on screen. When a pair of truck drivers stop at a run-down ramen shop, they befriend the widowed owner and help her turn the restaurant's fortunes around. A lovely story of community, passion, and human nature all filtered through the appreciation of good food, Tampopo is a cinematic feast. \u2014PV\nTampopo is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nTo Be or Not to Be\nYear: 1942\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 39m\nDirector: Ernst Lubitsch\nCast: Carole Lombard, Jack Benny, Robert Stack\nErnst Lubitsch\u2019s 1942 masterpiece is an uproarious and touching anti-war story about a group of actors who use their theatrical skills to dupe a group of Nazi soldiers in occupied Warsaw. Superstar acting couple Joseph (Jack Benny) and Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) run a theater planning to put on a performance of \u201cGestapo,\u201d a comedic play satirizing Hitler. But when Germany invades and a Nazi spy schemes to give a list of secret identities of Resistance fighters to the Nazis, the troupe uses every theater trick in the book to outmaneuver the Nazis (including a visiting Hitler himself) and do their part in the war effort.\nWith hilarious repeated gags, disguises galore, and a rock-solid emotional foundation of a group of people trying to look out for each other in the face of evil, To Be or Not to Be is a high mark in the history of American cinema and one of my personal favorite movies ever made. \u2014PV\nTo Be or Not to Be is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel.\nThe Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience\nYear: 2019\n\ufeffRun time: 30m\nDirector: Mike Diva, Akiva Schaffer\nCast: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer\nThe Lonely Island dropped this musical movie \u2014 a spoof of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade focused on Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire\u2019s notorious 1980s home run streak \u2014 out of nowhere in 2019. It deserves more love.\nIn line with their previous efforts, like Tour de Pharmacy and 7 Days in Hell (co-starring Kit Harington!), The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience explores the shared psyche of Canseco and McGwire through poetry, abstract imagery, and profane lyrics. Alana Haim, Maya Rudolph, Hannah Simone, Jenny Slate, Jim O\u2019Heir, and Sterling K. Brown \u2014 as Sia \u2014 all appear. Surprisingly, Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer don\u2019t skimp on the darkness of the Bash Brothers. With lyrics like \u201cStab that needle in my ass until I am rich \/ Make me a god with the chemical sciences,\u201d the Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience eventually finds McGwire begging a vision of his father to save his life as Canseco raps about how therapy is for the weak. \u2014MP\nThe Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience is available to stream on Netflix.\nWheels on Meals\nYear: 1984\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 38m\nDirector: Sammo Hung\nCast: Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao\nFew creative teams have ever managed the consistent level of excellence that Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao did with their Hong Kong martial arts action comedies in the 1980s, and Wheels on Meals is one of the best of an outrageously good group of movies (and my personal favorite). Set and shot in Barcelona, the movie centers on Thomas (Chan) and David (Yuen), a pair of cousins who run a food truck (with skateboarding tricks to boot) and find themselves enamored with a local woman (Lola Forner). When they run into a somewhat incompetent private investigator (Sammo Hung) who is also looking for the woman, the group bands together to save her when she is suddenly kidnapped.\nWheels on Meals features some of the very best fight scenes of Jackie Chan\u2019s prolific filmography, as he squares off against legendary kickboxer Benny Urquidez (the two would later fight again in Dragons Forever), who at the time was among the most prominent and successful fighters in the world. The whole movie is worth your time, but if you want to just find their six-minute marathon fight session on YouTube, there are few things better in this world.\nIf you like this, you should also check out Project A, which came out a year before and features one of the most daring and jaw-dropping stunts of Chan\u2019s illustrious career. \u2014PV\nWheels on Meals is available to stream for free with ads on Plex and FreeVee, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon.\n\nThis article, authored by Toussaint Egan, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-16 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":597}
{"title":"Palestine\u2019s growing tech industry has been literally blown apart by Israel\u2019s war on Hamas","context":"## Palestine\u2019s growing tech industry has been literally blown apart by Israel\u2019s war on Hamas\n\nPalestine\u2019s growing tech industry has been literally blown apart by the war between Israel and Hamas\nGaza, despite being one of the most economically challenged regions in the world, has ironically always been a tech hub \u2014 not only for Palestine and Palestinians, but also for the world: International companies have, for many years, sought out a presence there to collaborate with talented tech freelancers and the startups that gradually emerged from the region. For example, according to sources who helped build those bridges, Nvidia, famed for its role in the new AI boom, has been working with at least 100 engineers from the region for years. (Tragically, the initiative to employ Palestinians in this outsourcing was that of Mellanox founder Eyal Waldman, whose daughter was brutally murdered in the attacks by Hamas).\nSince at least 2008, TechCrunch been covering technology companies out of Palestine, some serving their direct audience, some serving the tech world internationally. Silicon Valley had taken an increasing interest in Palestine as a tech hub, but like the ecosystem itself, it\u2019s nascent: To date, those working in the region estimate that as much as $10 million has been invested in the Palestinian tech ecosystem.\nNotably, in 2017, Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff joined Silicon Valley luminaries in backing the first-ever coding academy to be created in Gaza.\nGaza Sky Geeks, an Alphabet-backed initiative based in Gaza that provides pre-seed investments, training and technology resources to Palestine\u2019s Gazan population, has been a beacon of entrepreneurship in the region.\nAll of that is now effectively gone, like the buildings in Gaza itself.\nIsrael is currently retaliating militarily against the attacks on its people, on its soil, and the hostages subsequently taken by Hamas \u2014 the ruling organization in Gaza that kidnapped at least 150 people and took them into Gaza during brutal attacks on Israel last weekend that killed 1,300 people.\nThat strategy has seen Israel pummeling the \u201cGaza Strip\u201d with bombs to eradicate it of Hamas and to get its hostages back. Over 1,500 people in Palestine so far have been killed as a result. The tech industry in Israel \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest export and its biggest single contributor to GDP \u2014 is also taking a big knock, but inevitably the impact on the smaller and more fragile ecosystem in Gaza has been significantly more serious. The physical, economic and societal destruction resulting from that leaves any future for the tech industry there in doubt.\nQuite simply, there is no escaping the consequences of the war for anyone, let alone tech workers.\n\u201cWhat is happening to tech in Gaza is that Israel is crunching it. Obliterating it,\u201d one source inside the territory told TechCrunch.\nIsrael has now amassed soldiers near the north of Gaza, ahead of an expected ground offensive into the densely populated enclave. About 1.1 million people living in northern areas have been told to leave in the next day. The UN has warned of \u201cdevastating humanitarian consequences\u201d from these latest moves. A total blockade on the territory is being enforced with fuel, food and water running out. Israel says it won\u2019t lift the restrictions unless Hamas frees all hostages.\nSpeaking to Ryan Sturgill, an American national and former head of the Gaza Sky Geeks (GSG) accelerator run by sponsor Mercy Corps, an NGO aid organization, the situation on the ground appears dire, after waves of shelling by the Israeli military.\n\u201cThe area around the the Mercy Corps building, which housed Gaza Sky Geeks, has been leveled. The structure is standing but blown out. The front of it is sort of ripped off,\u201d he said.\nGaza Sky Geeks is the largest tech hub in Palestine, providing a wide range of tech training at scale. In 2022, 5,000 coders and developers from across the West Bank and Gaza graduated from the program.\nVideo evidence (and pictured above) posted on LinkedIn shows a blown-out building with the Mercy Corps sign.\n\u201cWho knows what\u2019s going to happen. The offices are destroyed, the fiber lines are destroyed. The universities are destroyed. Three main universities in Gaza that produce all the computer science grads are leveled. I don\u2019t even know if people will ever be able to go back to Northern Gaza after what\u2019s happening today.The educational institutions that are there are gone,\u201d Sturgill added.\nHe had been helping Palestinian tech startups raise capital in the West Bank and Gaza since January.\n\u201cUntil now, there had been a pretty significant growth. A lot of companies in Saudi Arabia have been setting up back offices [in Palestine] for development for all sorts of new companies and even apps that are now growing in the Gulf, because Saudi has been growing so quickly on the tech front. Nvidia, and other international companies, has outsourcing operations in Palestine. Apple has outsourcing operations, Microsoft has R&D, and they would even like to see those expand. There\u2019s companies that had 200 developers sitting in offices in Ramallah,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to all of the heads of these different offices; most of them are in in Israel. They are very positive people who want to try to support the tech industry there and those efforts have been working well and growing,\u201d he added.\nIndeed, one of the main Palestinian VC funds, Ibtikar, had recently raised its second fund of $30 million.\nHigh-growth companies emerging from Palestine include Mena Analytics (data analytics, invested in by Flat6Labs); Olivery (last-mile logistics, Flat6Labs, Gaza Sky Geeks Ibtikar Fund); Coretava (employee and customer loyalty); and SellEnvo (an Amazon fulfillment partner).\nSturgill said that as well as the intensely difficult conditions in Gaza, which is being hit by Israeli missiles, the situation in Ramallah is \u201csuper tense. I feel like the situation is going to get significantly worse there over the coming weeks.\u201d\nIliana Montauk, co-founder and CEO of Manara \u2014 a social impact startup funded by Y Combinator, Seedcamp, Reid Hoffman, Eric Ries, Marc Benioff, Paul Graham, and Jessica Livingston, among others \u2014 told TechCrunch via email that connectivity has decreased significantly in the past 24 hours.\n\u201cThough Gaza has been bombed many times before, this time is completely different for the tech sector for several reasons. Electricity was cut off to the entire [Gaza] strip. A significant amount of infrastructure has been bombed (including both ISPs and many tall apartment buildings that hold cell phone towers). Entire middle-class neighborhoods are being destroyed.\u201d\nShe said in the past if an entire neighborhood got destroyed, it was usually one bordering Israel and a poorer area, thus less impacting the tech sector.\n\u201cThe tech sector is almost completely unable to function in Gaza right now,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people are in too much danger to be able to work; some have evacuated three times in the past 24 hours, moving from friend\u2019s house to family house, because each neighborhood they end up in is the next one being bombed. They usually receive warnings to evacuate their homes 10 minutes before a bombing, so they don\u2019t sleep and monitor the situation constantly ready to evacuate in a minute\u2019s notice.\n\u201cMost people have lost cell phone connections and internet access completely, or have some access to 2G only on their cell phones. Electricity is no longer being provided even for a few hours a day now, and people are running out of gas for their generators,\u201d she added.\nManara has around 100 software engineers in Gaza, some working remotely for tech companies in Silicon Valley\/Europe.\nMontauk said one software engineer who works at Upwork disappeared for several days, until being found alive.\nDalia Awad, whose Medium post about getting into Google from Gaza went viral in 2021 (it was at one point #1 on Hacker News and tweeted by Paul Graham), returned to Gaza after her internships at Google and Datadog to graduate from university. She had a full-time job offer at Datadog in Paris but decided to stay home in Gaza and look for a remote job so she could be close to family.\nOn Tuesday she wrote to Montauk, saying: \u201cTonight was the worst night ever. My family and I are good, thankfully. The bombing was everywhere and we couldn\u2019t know where it was because there was no internet. Many of my friends lost their houses in the Rimal area. There is no wifi internet, we connect to the cellular data on our phones but it\u2019s only 2G and it connects for a few minutes then cuts off. We can only send Whatsapp messages. So we can\u2019t really read news on social media. In the morning we saw these videos from our friends who shared it on whatsapp but it takes FOREVER to download a video of a few seconds.\u201d\nMontauk said Awad had not responded to her in the past day.\nMontauk, a former director of Gaza Sky Geeks, said: \u201cBefore this escalation, the Gaza tech scene was growing. I was just in Riyadh and met companies that hire entire software development teams in Gaza. Upwork and other Silicon Valley companies are now hiring software engineers remotely from Gaza. In addition, some had left to work abroad at companies like Google, Amazon, Qualtrics, etc. Last time I was in Gaza a year ago, almost everyone I talked to asked me how they could get a job and leave Gaza. They were worried about more bombings and wanted to bring their children up in a place without such a high risk. These people just want to live normal lives.\u201d\nThose who are living in the West Bank say the activity in Gaza has had an inevitable impact.\n\u201cFor a Palestinian young woman like me living in the West Bank, I can confirm that there has been a noticeable freeze in terms of activity,\u201d said Leen Abubaker of Flow Accelerator and co-founder at Sawaed19. \u201cTech companies are either operating on a very limited scale, with employees struggling to reach their offices in the West Bank due to unsafe roads blocked by Israeli occupation forces and settlers, or they have been forced out of business entirely in Gaza.\u201d\nShe added that a number of buildings in Gaza that are key to the tech industry there, such as Burj Al-Watan, had been destroyed by Israeli airstrikes and that the tech industry is not the first priority for people in the urgent situation. \u201cHow can you possibly detach from the distressing reality and cling to the remaining shreds of hope for your business?\u201d\nMohammad Alnobani is a Palestinian founder of The Middle Frame, an Arab stock image platform powered by AI tools that aims to shatter stereotypes about the Arab world through images and reducing bias in AI.\nHe told me he was on his way back from the One Young World Summit in Belfast, speaking about peace and reconciliation, and about to reach the borders to cross to Palestine to get back to his family, when the war broke out.\n\u201cThe borders closed down and I had to turn around and go back to Jordan,\u201d he said. \u201cI am still there, continuously checking on my family in Jerusalem, and trying to reach out to my connections in Gaza.\u201d His co-founder, Raya Fatayer, is in Ramallah, staying at home with her baby and husband, not able to travel.\n\u201cOur fellow entrepreneurs in Gaza had their homes demolished by air strikes, some we can\u2019t even reach anymore since the electricity is out and they have no power,\u201d he said. \u201cDealing with the situation while trying our best to move forward with our work is a daily challenge.\u201d\nHe said this outbreak of hostilities with Israel is clearly different: \u201cBefore, every time Gaza faced air strikes, we knew that certain areas were almost safe. Clearly today, nobody is safe.\u201d\n(This piece was later edited to include relevant information about the attacks by Hamas).\n\nThis article, authored by Mike Butcher, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-14 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":598}
{"title":"Consistent policy is key to unlocking the climate tech boom, but the UK\u2019s U-turn isn\u2019t helping","context":"## Consistent policy is key to unlocking the climate tech boom, but the UK\u2019s U-turn isn\u2019t helping\n\nWhen British prime minister Rishi Sunak appeared in front of the hastily assembled press on September 20, the letter-crammed slogan on his lectern caused the country to squint: \u201cLong-term decisions for a brighter future,\u201d it read.\nWe now know, of course, there was little in the speech that followed that brought hope. Certainly not concerning the technological fight for our future climate.\nNot that long ago, the UK seemed a rather brighter beacon in the industrial transition toward reversing the global climate breakdown. The countrywide goals were laid out. COP26 at least offered a forum and a spotlight. London has made strides in establishing itself as a hub for green tech startups. On the narrow but viable path toward net zero, leaders were at least taking the right steps.\nThen came the nadir of the last few weeks.\nLast week, with the government\u2019s already infamous U-turn on its green pledges, the nation joined in a consternated chorus with global leaders to lament the prime minister\u2019s short-sighted choice. Sunak has pushed back the British net-zero transition timeline by at least five years.\nThe first and most galling concern is, obviously, the consequences for the future of our species on this planet. The next biggest issue, currently being voiced by leaders across industries and especially within the climate tech and climate finance sectors, is the message it sends out to those of us in the trenches actually trying to build technology to change the world and enable a sustainable future.\nThat message is loud and clear: The U.K. government isn\u2019t willing to be consistent when it comes to climate crisis response policy, which, aside from capital and the support of nascent tech markets, is one of the most critical things anyone in our sector can hope for.\nFor entrepreneurs, innovators and businesses to thrive and unlock the economic potential that comes from creating new industries, we need a consistent approach from the government.\nI care about this because, as Americans who chose to build a biocatalyst engineering company here in the U.K., we\u2019re acutely aware of the impact such a reversal of policy has on every stage of our sector\u2019s existence. All major technological innovation ultimately comes from government support at the very beginning. We wouldn\u2019t have affordable solar panels, microchips, mobile phones or the internet without government funding, government subsidies, government encouragement and government infrastructure. You can\u2019t scale technology that is going to make a considerable impact without upfront capital to match.\nIn January of this year, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt unveiled a long-term vision to grow the economy, saying, \u201cI want the world\u2019s tech entrepreneurs, life science innovators and clean energy companies to come to the U.K. because it offers the best possible place to make their vision happen.\u201d Unless his long-term vision was only meant to last until the end of the summer, for entrepreneurs, innovators and businesses to thrive and unlock the economic potential that comes from creating new industries, we need a consistent approach from the government.\nWe have enormous fiscal potential. Within the U.K. climate tech community, we are working to create high-paying jobs and value for investors across just about every asset class. And collectively \u2014 hell, individually \u2014 our solutions could genuinely change the world.\nOf course, this is the common cause we should be united around. Our company is trying to move industry away from a reliance on fossil fuels to make chemicals, among other things. But the impact of these political spasms and contradictions in our climate commitments has on, say, an EV battery business \u2014 which has just seen the market demand for its output slide down the road by five years \u2014 isn\u2019t hard to appreciate. If giants like Ford are feeling the frustration, imagine the mood at a small green tech startup.\nSo what\u2019s the play? How can the government support those striving against an increasingly insecure (and insincere) backdrop?\nThe response of any tech company impacted by last week\u2019s news surely has to be this.\nFirst, we need a consistent macroeconomic policy. This has a major impact on startups raising and deploying capital into climate R&D. The global economic contraction has made it difficult for these businesses to raise any money. Overall approaches to the economy have trickle-down effects on how we, as businesses, make money and run our operations. Right down to salaries, which alone are hard to keep up with inflation-based pay rises.\nThe second is a consistent tax policy. One of the most critical things for startups is research and development (R&D) tax credits. This was a lifeline that gave small, research-intensive companies months of budget runway every year, as it effectively saw them get a third of the money spent in R&D back. The government announced it would be scrapping that last year, and it is only thanks to a lobbying effort spearheaded by the Startup Coalition that, at the last minute, a portion of that tax credit was able to be preserved.\nWhich leads to the third and most important point: A consistent climate policy. The impact of not having one is playing out in real time, right now. Sunak\u2019s public U-turn doesn\u2019t just undermine science and play into the hands of the climate skeptics. It also plows headlong into the future of any climate tech company whose launch plans have to be aligned around decarbonization timelines. This will damage economic confidence. People will lose jobs. And action, alas, will be further delayed.\nIn the end, it\u2019s simple: Inconsistency breeds uncertainty. So give us consistency. It is possible for our sector to succeed in spite of bad policies. But to thrive, we need consistent resolutions and behavior from a government that actually cares about leading in this critical fight. Given the colossal stakes, which were at least recently taken seriously, is that really asking too much?\n\nThis article, authored by Carrie Andrews, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-13 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":599}

The Air can handle some light video editing if the need arises, but if you need more power, spring for one of the newer, beefier options.\nMacBook Pro Photograph: Apple\nWe really only recommend this MacBook Pro (7\/10, WIRED Review) if you want the touch bar. It does have the same M2 chip as the 13-inch MacBook Air (our top pick in our Best MacBooks guide), but it still comes with the same 13.3-inch display, 720p webcam, and two Thunderbolt USB-C ports. Performance is great, and there's reliable battery life, but we don't suggest it for processor-intensive workloads.\nMacBook Air Photograph: Apple\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first large-screen option within the Air family. It packs all the same features as the 13-inch MacBook Air including a redesigned chassis, 1080p webcam, and M2 chip\u2014while still maintaining a lightweight and thin design. It's an excellent option for those who spend all day working off a laptop and don't want to plug into an external monitor.\nThis is our favorite external keyboard in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. It's a great option if you're a fan of the Magic Keyboard and are looking to fully replicate your MacBook setup. However, this version is fairly bare-bones\u2014it doesn't come with a Touch ID button or the same function row keys as the M-series MacBooks (that model isn't on sale, sadly). But it does come with the standard keys like playback controls, a Mission Control key, as well as a number pad. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this keyboard, so far.\nApple Studio Display Photograph: Apple\nThe Studio Display (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) has a spacious 27-inch display that's perfect for juggling multiple apps at the same time and a 5K resolution that's stunningly sharp (there's no HDR though, so colors look slightly more contrasty and saturated compared to the neutral tones on Apple's Pro Display XDR). Although it's pricey, this is an excellent monitor for those who want a really accurate and sharp screen. Equipped with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers, it's ideal for video calls too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, yet.\nIf you're constantly working on the go, a portable monitor is a great way to get more screen real estate. This one from Mobile Pixels attaches to your laptop screen using magnets (you'll have to be comfortable with sticking and leaving adhesive magnets on the back of your laptop) and connects via a USB-C cable. Simply slide it out to reveal a 13-inch display. It adds some bulk and thickness to your laptop, but you can remove it when it's not in use.\nWe love this laptop stand for those who prefer working from your bed or couch. The stand's height isn't adjustable, but you have the option to raise the base to position it at the best angle for typing, watching a movie on a tablet, or sketching. There's also extra space for your coffee mug and a small drawer for storing knickknacks.\nTwelve South StayGo Mini USB-C Hub Photograph: Twelve South\nWe've used this hub with iPads, but it's also great for MacBooks. Plug it in via the USB-C port on your laptop and you'll have access to another USB-C port for passthrough charging, a USB-A port, an HDMI output, and a headphone jack. It's also fairly compact and thin, so it won't add to much bulk to your laptop.\nThis is the runner-up to the aforementioned Twelve South StayGo Mini in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. With support for up to three displays at once (either DisplayPort or HDMI for each), it's an excellent choice for anyone using multiple monitors to get work done. The dock also packs six USB 3.0 ports (two on the front, four in the back) and a gigabit Ethernet port. All you have to do is plug in your MacBook for a multi-monitor setup instantly. With an output of up to 60 watts, you can also the dock to charge your laptop as well. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\nWe recommend Satechi's 108-watt wall charger if you own a MacBook Pro. It comes with three USB-C ports, each with the ability to charge at 100 watts if only one device is connected (making it perfect for the 16-inch MacBook Pro). But if you want to charge three gadgets simultaneously, it'll charge them at 45, 30, and 30 watts, respectively, 58, 30, and 20 watts, or 65, 20, and 20 watts, depending on what you're charging. It's also on the larger side, but it's not as big as the one from Apple, and the plug folds up too.\nSatechi 165-Watt GaN Four-Port Charger Photograph: Satechi\nThis handy charger has enough power to juice up two MacBook Pro models simultaneously. But it's also great if you have a lot of devices around your desk that constantly need to be charged. It has a little stand to prop it up, a short cord that goes out to an outlet, and four USB-C ports that output 100 watts each. It dipped lower to $90 back in July, but this is still a great deal.\nWe've featured this deal a few times during previous shopping holidays. It's still a good one. This tablet stand is included in several WIRED guides, including the Best iPad Accessories and the Best Work-from-Home Gear. The stand is lightweight, portable, and easy to use.\nApple Watch and Strap Deals\nRead our Best Apple Watch and Best Apple Watch Accessories guides for more.\nApple Watch SE Photograph: Apple\nIf you don't need all the extensive capabilities that come with the Apple Watch Series 9, then the second-generation Apple Watch SE is a great option for most people. It can still track important health and fitness features, and with the latest S8 chip, you'll also get the redesigned Compass app and Crash Detection. It has support for WatchOS 10 too, so you don't have to worry about missing out on the latest software updates. This is the lowest price we've tracked yet. The larger 44-mm version is also on sale for $229 ($50 off).\nApple Watch Ultra 2 Photograph: Apple\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old but it's already on sale. It's our favorite smartwatch for outdoor sports. It packs a new (and bright) 3,000-nit display, the latest S9 chip for faster processing, and the new ultra-wideband chip for precision-locating your phone. As with last year's version, it also comes equipped with a useful Action button and the three-mic array. It's a great option if you're heavily into outdoor sports and are looking for a rugged, full-functioning smartwatch to take along with you. It's also the Apple Watch with the best battery life thanks to its massive size.\nApple Silver Milanese Loop Photograph: Apple\nThe Silver Milanese Loop band is a great metal band for when you're not using your Apple Watch for workouts. It's made from stainless steel, the thin mesh is extremely flexible, and the magnetic clasp makes it easy to adjust the sizing. This deal applies to the 41-mm size in silver and graphite, but the 45-mm band is also on sale.\nThis is the best band for the Apple Watch Ultra in our Best Apple Watch Accessories guide. It's made from an elastomer with a titanium buckle. We specifically like that it's stretchy, bright, and fits small wrists. The band is also easy to wash and shows dirt much less easily than the fabric bands. It's compatible with the large 45-mm Apple Watch Series 8 as well.\nWe like this microfiber mat since it keeps your desk looking nice and clean, and doubles as a giant mousepad. It's pretty minimalist and only comes in black, but at this sale price that's all we need.\nEarbud and Headphone Deals\nRead our Best Wireless Earbuds guide for more.\nAirPods Pro Photograph: Apple\nThe latest version of the AirPods Pro (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) was just announced last month at Apple's hardware event and they're already on sale. These buds are identical to the old pair on the outside, but they pack some changes internally. In addition to slightly improved sound, there are also new Adaptive Audio features and a new Conversation Awareness mode (that turns audio down and lowers the sound of the background so you can hear someone talking to you). The version with the Lightning port is currently out of stock, but who wants those anyway?\nThe Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones (7\/10, WIRED Review) pack excellent calling and noise canceling, good sound quality, and fantastic wireless range. They also offer a stable fit and compact design. These headphones are missing a few key features though, including sensors for auto-pause and multi-band EQ. But with improved sound quality and ANC, along with a few cool extra features for both Android and Apple devices, these are still a solid option\u2014especially if they're on sale. This is the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\nBeats Fit Pro Photograph: Beats\nThe Beats Fit Pro (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) deliver a comfortable fit, great sound, and seamless integration with both iOS and Android. They also feature active noise canceling and decent mics. Equipped with Apple's proprietary H1 headphone chip, they work like AirPods when used with an iPhone. These work great on Android too\u2014complete with an app that allows you to perform a fit test and customize the controls. They dipped to $125 back in August, but this is still a good deal.\nWIRED associate editor Parker Hall says the Studio Buds fit better than most buds he's ever tried. He also likes that they have extremely useful physical buttons on the outside to play and pause audio as well as control noise cancelation. They'll also stay put in your ears even when breaking a sweat and sound as good as Apple's AirPods Pro. This is the same price we saw on Prime Day in July, but it's also the lowest the price has dipped.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro Photograph: Beats\nThe Powerbeats Pro (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) came out in 2019, but these are still our top recommendation for earbuds with the most secure fit\u2014making them an excellent option for the most intensive workouts. With an IPX4 water-resistance rating, they'll also stay protected from sweat. They have excellent sound quality and offer an impressive nine hours of battery life (with an extra 18 hours in the case). It's worth noting that many of the features won't work with an Android phone, but the core functions will.\nApple Charger Deals\nCheck out our Best Apple 3-in-1 Wireless Chargers and Best MagSafe Power Banks guides for more.\nAnker 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Cube Photograph: Anker\nThis 2.5-inch cube from Anker is a great compact charger. It comes with a MagSafe pad on top (that charges at up to 15 watts), a top section that hinges to a 60-degree angle to reveal a charging surface for your AirPods, and a shelf on the side that has a built-in Apple Watch charger (which can comfortably accommodate any Apple Watch including the Ultra). You'll also get a 5-foot cable and a 30-watt charger in the box. It supports fast charging too.\nAnker 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Charging Dock Photograph: Anker\nThis is another excellent and compact 3-in-1 wireless charger from Anker. A MagSafe pad charges iPhones up to 15 watts at a slanted angle, and on the side is a standard Apple Watch puck (no fast-charging support). In the space inside the triangle is where you can place your AirPods Pro (or any other wireless earbuds case) to top them up.\nBelkin 3-in-1 Wireless Charger Photograph: Belkin\nThis is currently our favorite Apple 3-in-1 wireless charger. The T-shaped design is compact, so it won't take up that much space on your nightstand or desk, and the charging tree suspends two of your devices midair. You can use it to charge your iPhone (at the fastest 15-watt charging speed Apple allows), fast-charge the Apple Watch Series 7\/8\/9\/Ultra, and use the base to charge your AirPods Pro (or AirPods with a wireless charging case) simultaneously all from a single outlet. It's normally around $150 but was discounted to $100 in August, so it's possible that Prime Day won't be your last opportunity to snag it for less.\nAnker MagGo 637 Photograph: Anker\nAll you have to do is stick your iPhone to this adorable little orb and it'll start charging. On the back, you'll also find two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and three AC outlets. It's both cute and tidy. It fluctuates in price very often, but it's still a good deal.\nSatechi's fold-up wireless charging stand has a 10,000-mAh capacity (complete with LEDs to show you how much juice you have left) and can wirelessly charge both your phone and a wireless earbuds case (as long as it's Qi-certified). There's also a USB-C port to power up a third device. The only gripe we have is that it's slow\u2014delivering 10 watts of wireless charging power for phones (7.5 watts for iPhones), 5 watts for earbuds, and 10 watts via the USB-C port.\nApple 35-Watt Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter Photograph: Apple\nApple's dual USB-C port power adapter is an essential accessory if you have a tendency to forget to pack chargers for your devices on the go. With two USB-C ports, you can use it to recharge both your iPhone and MacBook simultaneously. Rated at 35 watts, it's also powerful enough to recharge an iPad Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nThe MagSafe Duo makes for an excellent travel companion if you own an iPhone and an Apple Watch. Rather than packing separate chargers, the MagSafe Duo combines chargers for both all within a compact, foldable form factor. You can also use it to charge your AirPods (if it comes with a wireless charging case) and other Qi-certified devices.\niOttie Velox Pro Magnetic Wireless Cooling Car Dash Mount Photograph: iOttie\niOttie's Velox Pro Magnetic Wireless Cooling Charger is great for those who prefer a mount on your dash or windshield and have an iPhone 12 or later. The suction cup attaches to a dashboard pad or windshield and proved secure in our testing. The telescopic arm (combined with a ball joint) also delivers a wide range of movement to help you find the ideal position. Unfortunately, it maxes out at 7.5 watts for charging, but you can remove the USB-C charging cable when the iPhone is fully charged. There's also a built-in fan to help keep the temperature down when it's hot out.\nAnker Nano USB-C Power Bank Photograph: Anker\nThis is a great power bank if you don't want to worry about carrying a cable around, since it simply slots into the bottom of your phone\u2014thanks to the built-in rotating USB-C or Lightning connector (MFi certified). It also offers 5,000 mAh of energy, and there's a USB-C port for recharging it, complete with a short cable. However, it might not be a good pick if you have a thick case.\nThis 2-in-1 charger is featured in our guide to the Best MagSafe Accessories. The price matches the lowest we have tracked. It doesn't have a built-in Apple Watch charger, but it can top off your compatible wireless earbuds whilst simultaneously charging your iPhone. It charges at the maximum 15-watt rate, and you can turn your iPhone sideways for iOS 17\u2019s new StandBy mode, converting it into a bedside alarm clock.\nAnker 737 Power Bank Photograph: Anker\nWe just added this power bank as our top upgrade pick in our guide to the Best Portable Chargers. It's pricey, but today's deal makes it more accessible. It charges from zero to completely full in an hour and boasts a whopping 24,000-mAh capacity. And it's powerful enough to charge laptops and tablets as well as phones and other gadgets. There's even a built-in display to monitor stats like temperature and remaining battery percentage.\nNomad's wireless charger is one of our favorite MagSafe wireless chargers. It delivers the maximum 15-watt charging speed possible, but it's not meant to be held up while you use the phone. It doesn't have a power adapter but includes a USB-C-to-USB-C cable. It'll sit securely on your desk and can charge an Apple Watch, too.\nThis travel kit from ESR works well if you want something that can prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. It can also display your Apple Watch in Nightstand mode, so you can peek and see how long before you must get out of bed. The main body folds open with a MagSafe charging pad for your iPhone and a slot behind for your AirPods. Unfortunately, it doesn't support fast charging and it's capped at 7.5 watts and 5 watts for the iPhone and Apple Watch, respectively. But it's a good, affordable charger. It dipped a little lower to $40 back in July, but this is still a solid deal.\nPhone Cases and Accessory Deals\nBe sure to read our Best MagSafe Accessories and Best iPhone 15 Cases guides for other picks.\nPhotograph: iOttie\nWhat we like best about this phone mount is that you can use it one-handed. The arms automatically close around the phone when you place it against the trigger button. To remove it, press the release bars. There's also a telescopic arm and ball joint that allows you to tweak the placement and set an ideal angle. We also love the clever magnetic tab that attaches the charging cable to the back of the mount, to keep from having to fish around for it. Plus, it's super sturdy\u2014even on bumpy roads.\nIf you're tired of people glancing over at your display in public, the Glass Elite Privacy 360 will block anyone from seeing content on your screen from the sides. It also feels great and is fairly easy to apply. Our only gripe is that Zagg's screen protectors are expensive. This has hit as low as $24, but it's a solid deal if you're in need of a screen protector sooner rather than later.\nCasetify Case Photograph: Casetify\nCasetify offers an overwhelming variety of case designs, but they can get pricey. So, if you've been eyeing one, we suggest taking advantage of the storewide sale. We like the Impact MagSafe cases, which have chunky bumpers and edges to protect the screen and are also made of plant-based materials as well as upcycled Casetify cases. The Bounce case is another solid choice that feels more rugged, but they're quite bulky. It's worth noting the sale doesn't apply to iPhone 15 products.\nOtterBox Figura Photograph: Otterbox\nWe like OtterBox cases, and many are 20 percent off, including chargers, cables, and other accessories. We've got recommendations in our iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 case guides.\nCase-Mate Blox Photograph: Case-Mate\nIf you're looking for a trendy case, look no further than this blocky and rectangular one. The bright neon color makes the phone pop, and it also looks super unique. Aesthetics aside, it's also a fairly well-rounded case. The cutouts are all accurate, the buttons are great, and it comes with MagSafe support. We tested this case with the iPhone 14, but this one is for the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nPhotograph: Apple\nApple AirTags are our favorite Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users. This isn't a crazy sale, but getting these in a bundle of four means you can keep track of every set of keys, your luggage for a trip, or even your kids' backpack all at once.\nThose with an iPhone 14 or earlier can never have too many Lightning cables. These cables from Nomad are durable, available in different lengths, and come with the choice between USB-C and USB-A for the other end.\nRetailer Sale Pages\n\nThis article, authored by Brenda Stolyar, was published by Wired on 2023-10-10 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":600}
{"title":"NTPC: Why investors can accumulate this stock","context":"## NTPC: Why investors can accumulate this stock\n\nThe Power Ministry has scheduled tenders of around 50 GW annually of renewable energy for the next five years, to achieve the target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity. Alongside the government\u2019s thrust on ramping up renewable energy capacity, building incremental thermal capacity has also been a priority. This is because energy security has become an important issue with consistent increase in demand in recent years; power demand is now at all-time high\/peak levels.\nPSU thermal major NTPC appears to be well-placed to capture both themes \u2014 energy transition and energy security.\nSince our accumulate rating on NTPC in bl.portfolio dated August 13, 2023, the stock has gained around 48 per cent. This has been majorly on account of growth in earnings as well as re-rating in the stock from the trailing P\/E of around 10 times then, to 12 times now. During FY23, the company\u2019s revenue increased by around 32 per cent. While there was flattish growth in PAT during the period on account of increase in fuel cost, the same grew nearly 30 per cent YoY in H1FY24. NTPC is now trading at a one-year forward P\/E of around 11 times, which is around 35 per cent higher than its historical five-year average P\/E of around 8.2 times.\nThe re-rating in the stock has happened mainly due to company-specific and industry-level structural positives (which justify current premium to historical average) and the company\u2019s aggressive capacity addition plans. We maintain our postive stance on NTPC and investors can continue to accumulate the stock on account of growth plans in place, along with the strong revenue and earnings visibility due to assured return model. Further, it is offering a decent dividend yield of around 3 per cent.\nBusiness\nNTPC earns majority of revenue from sale of power generated from thermal-based generating stations. More than 90 per cent of its revenue is tied to long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) under cost-plus based tariff regime, which ensures pass-through of costs such as plant capacity charge, supplementary capacity charge (emission control system cost), interest on loan, interest on working capital and energy cost (fuel) and allows ROE (Return on equity) of 15.5 per cent over and above these costs.\nThe complete recovery of capacity charges is allowed when the plant shows technical availability (plant availability factor) over and above the normative level i.e. typically 85 per cent wherein the plant should be technically available to generate power with sufficient coal in place. However, do note that pass-through is allowed subject to normative parameters and provisions defined in the PPA.\nNTPC has assured coal supply, given its long-term fuel supply agreements (FSAs) with Coal India Limited (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) for supply of coal for 20 years for total Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ) of 183 MTPA. Further, the company has captive coal mining with capacity of 71 MMT.\nRecent performance\nDuring H1FY24, the company reported PAF (plant availability factor) in its coal-based generation stations to the tune of 93.32 per cent as against 92.05 per cent in H1FY23. Further, PLF (Plant Load Factor) i.e. capacity utilisation for the period has been 76.62 per cent against 77.27 per cent in the last year and national average of 68.75 per cent. The company reported a YoY increase in generation of around 4 per cent, reaching 212 billion units (BUs) in H1FY24. Coal supply during H1FY24 was 113 MMT, including 4 MMT of imported coal. The coal consumption during the corresponding previous period was 112 MMT, including 10 MMT of imported coal.\nThe company has reported flattish revenue growth in H1FY24 reaching close to \u20b988,058.44 crore. This has been on account of shutdown in certain plants due to repair work and grid restrictions, which is expected to improve, going forward, in the upcoming quarters, as per the management. The company saw a YoY growth of around 18 per cent in EBITDA reaching \u20b925,091 crore and thereby EBITDA margins expanded from 25 per cent to 29 per cent on a YoY basis. This has been mainly on account of lower fuel cost due to reduced share of imported coal. The imported coal price rose steeply in FY23, the pass-through of which might not have been allowed completely, which resulted in decline in margins in FY23.\nGrowth triggers in place\nNTPC plans to have 130 GW of installed power generation capacity comprising 60 GW of renewable energy from the current level of 3.3 GW. While this is quite a long-term target, in the near term, NTPC plans to add 15-16 GW of renewable energy by FY26. Currently, around 7.7 GW of RE capacity is under construction and 11 GW under different stages. Further, as all-time high peak power demand makes the case for having thermal-based capacity as an energy security, NTPC plans to add 10-11 GW of thermal-based capacity by FY26. The target for the same has been raised from 7 GW earlier. This will imply capacity growth during FY23-26 to the tune of 10-11 per cent CAGR from the current levels.\nThe management has given the guidance of capex to the tune of around \u20b928,373 crore for FY24. For FY25 and FY26 it will be on similar lines while capex will shoot up on account on growth in renewable-related capex post then as per the management.\nDuring our previous call, we highlighted that NTPC was attempting to monetise its stake in its renewable energy arm NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) by way of selling stake to a strategic partner. However, during Q1FY24 earnings call, management highlighted that the company is now looking to unlock value by way of IPO rather than onboarding strategic investor. However, the timeline is not yet certain as it will depend on market-based factors and within how much time substantial RE capacity is there on the ground.\nThe company has a D\/E of around 1.24 times as on H1FY24 and can, on account of its stable business model, access debt at a cheaper rate as compared to private power generation companies. The reasonable D\/E gives NTPC scope for further debt financing to fund its capex requirements.\n\nThis article was published by Business Line on 2023-11-11 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":601}
{"title":"The world came tantalizingly close to a deal to phase out fossil fuels","context":"## The world came tantalizingly close to a deal to phase out fossil fuels\n\nWhat would have been a historic deal to tackle a planetary crisis slipped out of reach at the eleventh hour. Even so, climate-vulnerable countries and environmental advocates scored some key wins with clean energy after heated climate negotiations wrapped up in the United Arab Emirates, a top oil- and gas-producing country.\nThis was the closest yet that countries have gotten to striking a global deal to phase out the use of coal, oil, and gas. But the summit was arguably still a home game for fossil fuel interests who threw their weight around the United Nations climate conference, called the 28th Conference of the Parties or COP28, where tens of thousands of delegates and activists from nearly every nation on Earth have gathered over the past two weeks to wrangle over the future of fossil fuels.\nNow that the dust has settled, these are some of the biggest decisions made in Dubai that could determine how we power our world in the future.\nThe beginning of the end for fossil fuels?\n\u201cThis text is a step forward on our path towards phasing out fossil fuels, but is not the historic decision we hoped for.\u201d\nMore than 100 countries came to the table pushing for an official agreement to \u201cphase out fossil fuels.\u201d Doing so would address a glaring omission in the 2015 Paris accord, which never actually mentions coal, oil, or natural gas despite being an international agreement to stop global warming. Alas, countries still aren\u2019t facing the root of the problem.\nBringing the deal to the finish line required nearly 200 countries to agree on the same language. Ultimately, draft language explicitly calling for the phaseout of fossil fuels was stricken from the final text of agreements brokered at this year\u2019s climate talks. What the world got instead is a weaker call for \u201ctransitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade.\u201d A landmark United Nations-backed climate report in 2018 found that countries need to cut their emissions nearly in half by 2030 to meet goals set in the Paris climate accord.\nThe final text also calls on countries to work toward \u201caccelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power.\u201d To be clear, every word in that phrase is pretty dirty. Coal of course is the most polluting fossil fuel, one reason why it\u2019s hard to ignore in a climate agreement. But a commitment to phase down its use is decidedly weaker than one to phase it out. It mirrors language in a recent letter addressed to participating governments from COP28 president Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber \u2014 who also happens to be the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.\nThe UN\u2019s decision to hold the summit in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer, wound up giving the fossil fuel industry unprecedented access. There were more fossil fuel lobbyists in Dubai than at any climate conference in the 28 years the United Nations has convened it. Industry representatives for fossil fuels outnumbered delegations from every country present at the talks except the United Arab Emirates and Brazil. Al Jaber even used his position as COP28 president to lobby for oil and gas deals with other governments, according to an investigation by the BBC and the Centre for Climate Reporting.\nEven so, there were hopeful signs last week when draft documents coming out of the conference included options to incorporate language that called on countries to phase out fossil fuel use (there was also an option not to include such a clause). Then the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sent a letter to its member states pressuring them to \u201cproactively reject any text or formula that targets energy i.e. fossil fuels rather than emissions.\u201d\nFollowing the letter, language that had previously called on countries to phase out fossil fuels vanished from subsequent draft texts. Backlash was swift. \u201cThis obsequious draft reads as if OPEC dictated it word for word,\u201d former US vice president Al Gore posted on X on Monday. \u201cCOP28 is now on the verge of complete failure.\u201d\nThat brings us back to the language coming out of COP28 to phase down unabated coal. Using the word \u201cunabated\u201d \u2014 whether for coal, oil, or gas \u2014 carves out a huge loophole for fossil fuels. It means that polluters can continue burning fossil fuels as long as they pair it with emerging technologies that capture greenhouse gas emissions (though typically not 100 percent of those emissions) that are still unproven at scale.\n\u201cThis text is a step forward on our path towards phasing out fossil fuels, but is not the historic decision we hoped for ... given the overwhelming momentum among countries in support of a renewable energy package and a long overdue fossil fuel phase out, we needed a far more ambitious result.\u201d Andreas Sieber, associate director of policy and campaigns for environmental group 350.org, said in a statement before the draft agreement was finalized at the conference\u2019s closing plenary.\nClean energy on the rise\nEven though the lack of a clear plan to phase out fossil fuels is a blow to climate action, this isn\u2019t exactly a zero sum game. Solar and wind power are already cheaper alternatives to coal, oil, and gas in most of the world when it comes to meeting new electricity demand. Nearly all of the world\u2019s new electricity supply over the next few years is expected to come from renewable and nuclear energy, according to the International Energy Agency. The agency, which was initially founded to safeguard the world\u2019s fuel supply after the 1970s oil crisis, called a global transition to clean energy \u201cunstoppable\u201d earlier this year and forecast that demand for coal, oil, and gas would peak this decade.\nWhen it comes down to it, getting cleaner sources of energy online looks inevitable at this point. There were some notable new commitments on the clean energy front in the final texts coming out of COP28, too. It calls for the tripling of renewable energy capacity globally by 2030, something that more than 100 countries had already pledged to do while negotiations were taking place last week.

{"title":"Daye now offers tampon-based STI screening \u2014 starting in the UK","context":"## Daye now offers tampon-based STI screening \u2014 starting in the UK\n\nU.K. femcare-turned-gynaecological-health startup, Daye, has expanded its tampon-based home screening service to add STI testing. The startup is billing this \u201cnon-invasive screening\u201d service for sexually transmitted infections as a \u201cworld first\u201d.\nThe \u201cSTI Diagnostic Tampon\u201d service uses Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing tech to detect the presence of pathogens. Daye is launching with the ability to test for five STIs \u2014 namely: Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomonas, mycoplasma and ureaplasma \u2014 which were selected because they are the most common STIs. But more tests are planned.\nThe move comes a year after the startup took the wraps off an ambitious push into gynaecological health \u2014 with the launch of a vaginal microbiome screening service. Daye tells TechCrunch it\u2019s had \u201cthousands\u201d of customers for that service \u2014 which is a little more complicated to engage with as samples need to be sent back along with an ice pack (and hopefully minimal postal delays) in order that the lab can detect live pathogens.\nThe STI test is simpler as the PCR test is looking for genetic material \u2014 dead or alive; this type of test doesn\u2019t distinguish \u2014 so the user just needs to pop their sample in the extraction solution provided before they post it off for analysis.\nDaye sells tampons for regular, menstrual use too, of course. But it\u2019s always been interested in doing more with the staple female hygiene product than just catching flow. Its signature product is a CBD-infused tampon for combating period cramps. Though it also sells a \u201cnude\u201d version (i.e. no CBD) \u2014 and that core offering is the basis for a growing range of vaginal- and sexual-health-screening services which repurpose the basic tampon as a novel sample collecting device.\nThe clever twist here is it makes what could be an intrusive test into something its customers are likely to be intimately familiar with \u2014 and literally as easy as inserting and removing a tampon.\nDaye didn\u2019t invent the idea of using tampons to test for STIs, as founder Valentina Milanova explained when we dug into its wider mission last year. U.K. university researchers pioneered menstrual tampon screening back in the 1990s. But Milanova is on a mission to expand the technique\u2019s use and utility \u2014 seeing it as a convenient way to help women learn a heck of a lot more about their own bodies from the comfort of their own bathrooms.\nThe startup also claims tampons make a better testing device than the swabs or other protocols a patient might be administered at a sexual health clinic or doctor\u2019s office since its test tampons collect more vaginal fluid and cover a larger surface area \u2014 so it contends this is both a more accurate way to STI test than a swab and more comfortable than a speculum.\nPCR testing, meanwhile, has gotten very familiar after the COVID-19 pandemic. Daye\u2019s STI test uses the same principle as this gold standard detection test for coronavirus \u2014 but in this case it\u2019s looking for trace (or more) amounts of genetic material from pathogens that cause STIs.\n\u201cThe specificity of PCRs ensures that false-positive results are reduced, providing a more reliable diagnosis,\u201d it suggests, also noting the test can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens in a single sample. So full marks for convenience.\nMore convenience is coming, too, as it adds more tests, too: Daye says HPV is next on its list \u2014 an STI which has been linked to increased cervical cancer risk.\nAnother on its list to add \u201csoon\u201d is to offer GBS screening for pregnant patients. \u201cGBS is a common bacteria often carried in the intestines or lower genital tract. While usually harmless in adults, it can cause severe infections in newborns if transmitted during delivery. Testing pregnant women for GBS allows for the timely administration of antibiotics during labour, significantly reducing the risk of neonatal infections,\u201d Daye tells us.\nThe startup also plans to offer herpes screening for everyone down the line.\nThe STI testing service is being launched in the U.K. first \u2014 at a cost of \u00a399 a pop \u2014 with the US slated to get the service \u201csoon\u201d. Daye is also aiming to expand screening services elsewhere in Europe, saying it\u2019s currently working on building out an aftercare offering to support patients across the EU.\nHow does the STI testing service work? The user receives a test kit in the post and, after self administering a vaginal swab by inserting and removing the test tampon and then preserving their sample as instructed, they post it sample back to Daye\u2019s partner lab for analysis \u2014 getting results digitally, via Daye\u2019s app, in a few days.\nFor a further \u00a329 they can also get a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d consultation about their results with a nurse. Users who don\u2019t purchase this optional extra, but do test positive for an STI, will receive a free five minute call to walk them through their results and advise on next steps, per Daye.\nOne question we had is related to how sexual health clinics may routinely test for HIV when a patient attends \u2014 i.e. even if they\u2019re at the clinic for another sexual health worry. So if more people choose to adopt at-home testing for STIs, thanks to Daye\u2019s convenient alternative, they may be missing out on the chance to acquire important health info \u2014 since clinics or doctor\u2019s offices can often nudge an attending patient to take the opportunity to test more widely while they\u2019re there in person.\nAsked how it\u2019s mitigating this risk, Daye told us: \u201cWe enable our patients to book in-clinic appointments for HIV screening, and in the future, we may also expand to at-home blood testing for HIV. We ensure that our patients are well-educated on the risks associated with HIV and are reminded of the need for regular testing. We\u2019d like to play a meaningful role in destigmatising sexual health and provide medically-backed advice on the recommended cadence of screening.\u201d\nThe startup also gave us a breakdown of the main customers for its novel vaginal microbiome screening service a year+ on from that launch \u2014 saying there are three main groups:\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-06 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":603}
{"title":"Cannabis use in pregnancy linked to small birth size, other poor outcomes","context":"## Cannabis use in pregnancy linked to small birth size, other poor outcomes\n\nUsing cannabis during pregnancy may come with a higher risk of poor outcomes, such as babies being born small for their gestational age, a new study suggests.\nAmong pregnant people who use cannabis, the risks are the highest for those who use the drug in both the first trimester and later in gestation, as opposed to only the first trimester, according to the study, published Tuesday (Dec. 12) in the journal JAMA .\n\"What I think this study evaluates, that has not been evaluated previously, is whether the timing and amount of exposure matters, and what we saw was that higher levels of cannabis exposure were associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes,\" first study author Dr. Torri Metz , an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Utah Health, told Live Science in an email. Using cannabis in the first trimester still carries risk, but the findings hint that stopping cannabis use within the first trimester could help prevent that risk from growing larger.\nNotably, the study reveals only a link between cannabis and certain poor pregnancy outcomes \u2014 it doesn't directly demonstrate that cannabis causes these effects. But it does suggest that \"cannabis use should be avoided during pregnancy to optimize maternal and neonatal [newborn] outcomes,\" the study authors wrote in the report.\nRelated: Eating just 2 cannabis gummies can put small kids at risk of toxic effects\nIn the study, the researchers screened frozen urine samples that had been collected from 9,200 pregnant people at eight U.S. medical centers. The participants were originally recruited between 2010 and 2013 for a long-term study on pregnancy outcomes and their samples have been stored since then.\nThe samples were taken during three time windows that respectively fell within the first trimester, the early second trimester, and the late second trimester into the third. For the new research, each sample was screened for a specific molecule that appears in urine when the body breaks down tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ), the psychoactive compound in cannabis.\nIn addition, the researchers reviewed the participants' medical records to look at their pregnancy outcomes. They took note of preterm births, stillbirths and instances when a newborn was born small for their gestational age; \"small\" was defined as being below the fifth percentile for their age and sex. They also noted when the mother experienced pregnancy-related high-blood-pressure disorders, such as gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.\nThese outcomes have been tied to dysfunction of the placenta, the organ that supplies a growing fetus with nutrients and oxygen while removing waste from the womb. Research in monkeys has suggested that cannabis exposure can alter gene activity in the placenta, and it's also linked to reduced oxygen and blood flow through the organ. In humans , cannabis exposure has been linked to slower-than-typical growth of the fetus, which can be related to problems with the placenta.\nIn the study, urine screening flagged 610 participants who had used cannabis in pregnancy. Nearly 200 used cannabis only in the first trimester, while the rest tested positive for cannabis both in the first trimester and later in pregnancy.\nParticipants who used cannabis had a higher risk of experiencing at least one of the poor pregnancy outcomes \u2014 nearly 26%, compared with 17.5% in the group that didn't use cannabis. The risk was highest for those who used cannabis late into pregnancy, and the risk also appeared to rise with the overall concentration of THC byproduct in a person's urine.\nThe researchers initially considered the pregnancy outcomes as a group, rather than separately, because \"we knew we did not have a large enough sample to examine all of these outcomes independently,\" Metz told Live Science. But as a secondary analysis, the researchers then zoomed in on specific pregnancy outcomes, to see which were most common in the available data.\nIn that analysis, cannabis use was linked to a higher chance that a baby would be born small, but it was not linked to a higher risk of high-blood-pressure disorders in pregnancy.\nCannabis use was also tentatively linked to a risk of stillbirth, with the group that used cannabis showing a higher rate than those who didn't use the drug. However, in a model that adjusted for other influential factors \u2014 such as nicotine exposure and the mother's age and insurance status \u2014 the cannabis-related stillbirth result was no longer statistically significant.\n\"There are other studies that have also found an association between cannabis use and stillbirth , so it is concerning that we also saw this association in unadjusted analyses,\" Metz said. However, because the link disappeared in the adjusted model, \"this also means that we likely needed a bigger cohort to look specifically at stillbirth as an outcome.\"\nFortunately, based on the current study's data, \"stillbirth is a rare outcome,\" Metz emphasized. Its risk just warrants further study in larger groups.\nThe current study has other limitations. For instance, the molecules in the frozen urine samples may have degraded somewhat over the years, although they were stored appropriately. The way people used cannabis is also unknown, so it's unclear if inhaling or taking edibles would come with different levels of risk, for example.\nAnd again, the study's design allows a link to be drawn between cannabis and pregnancy outcomes, but it can't say whether or how the drug actually caused the outcomes.\nThat said, \"I think this lends more evidence to the idea that there are potential risks, and really talk to patients about alternative methods of treating whatever it is they're hoping to treat with cannabis,\" Metz told JAMA in a podcast interview .\n\nThis article was published by Live Science: The Most Interesting Articles on 2023-12-13 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":604}
{"title":"Walks, tech and protein: how to parent your own parents","context":"## Walks, tech and protein: how to parent your own parents\n\nParenting no longer starts and stops with our children. Nor is it confined to those who have children. In a time of unrelenting change and ever-extending life, most of us will \u2013 at some stage \u2013 find ourselves \u201cparenting\u201d our own parents.\nIndeed, many of us \u2013 particularly those who had families later \u2013 will find ourselves simultaneously parenting our kids and our parents. In one breath we\u2019ll be begging our children to swap French fries for vegetables, and in the next breath we\u2019ll be urging our parents to exchange cake for sardines. Little wonder today\u2019s midlifers are known as the sandwich generation.\nThe relentless pace of technology \u2013 accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 has made everything infinitely more complicated, leaving many older (and not-so-old) people baffled and frustrated. In the last few years I\u2019ve witnessed friends and family dashing to help parents with poorly designed online banking systems, unruly fridge alarms, \u201cupgraded\u201d software that has changed beyond recognition, apps and phones that don\u2019t function as expected, and numerous other technical challenges.\nFrankly, technology is often baffling to me, too. Luckily I have kids who delight in parenting me \u2013 advising, explaining and guiding me on all things digital. But studies suggest that this helpfulness might not be as beneficial as we think. Grappling with new and baffling things forces the ageing brain to work in novel ways. A recent study from the University of Texas involving more than 200 elderly adults found that those who engaged with technology had better cognition and memory than their non-engaging peers.\nDigital engagement \u2013 whatever the device \u2013 protects the brain\nEven the stress we experience while battling with our computer can be helpful, sharpening our mental acuity. The study authors concluded that digital engagement \u2013 whatever the device \u2013 protects the brain. These findings reflect earlier studies that discovered that older people who made active use of technology were less likely to get dementia.\nDr Eamon Laird, researcher in health and ageing at Limerick university, agrees that we should be encouraging older parents to try new things. And the further out of their comfort zone they feel, the better. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to keep the mind active and fresh,\u201d he told me. \u201cNew challenges can help build and maintain new brain connections and can be good for brain and overall health.\u201d\nIf older people use technology to keep in touch with extended family and friends, that\u2019s a double whammy. When my 84-year-old mother recently joined Instagram, she not only expanded her grey matter but she also found an effective means of staying in touch with her grandchildren. Being social, says Laird, is as important as trying new things: \u201cResearch shows that those who are more social are also more resilient to chronic conditions and often have a stronger immune system.\u201d\nAnyone with older parents should be urging them out for a walk five days a week Dr Eamon Laird, health and ageing researcher\nDepression among the elderly is on the rise and often goes unnoticed. Gerontologists now believe that it is one of the most common psychiatric disorders among the elderly \u2013 with half of all cases going undiagnosed. When elderly parents become depressed (many of them come from a generation not accustomed to talking about their mental health), it can be difficult to know how to respond. But Laird\u2019s latest report suggests that a daily walk could help. His study of more than 4,000 older adults found that as little as 20 minutes of daily walking could cut the risk of depression by up to 43%. \u201cAnyone with older parents should be urging them out for a walk five days a week \u2013 and when they have a companion, the walk also doubles as a social occasion,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf they can walk for longer than 20 minutes, even better. Our study showed that the risk of depression fell in proportion to the time spent walking.\u201d\nAs well as a daily walk, Laird recommends vitamin D and B12 supplements \u2013 both of which appear to moderate the chance of depression in older people. \u201cDepression matters,\u201d he added. \u201cNot just because it reduces quality of life, but because in older people there seems to be a link between depression and dementia which we\u2019re still unpacking.\u201d\nHealth coach Susan Saunders found herself \u201cparenting\u201d her mother (who had dementia) while her own daughters were babies. \u201cI\u2019d advise anyone with a parent in the early stages of dementia to investigate all the available research trials. Start by joining Dementia Research, a nationwide register that matches volunteers to research programmes.\u201d\nEven if your parents don\u2019t require such intensive \u201cparenting\u201d, a simple supplement could help. A recent study from Columbia University involving 2,200 adults aged 60 and over found that an inexpensive multivitamin formulated specifically for older people improved cognition, memory and focus. In fact, the results were so marked that the researchers said the supplement could slow age-related memory decline by three years.\nBut while most of us can probably persuade our parents to take a multivitamin, suggesting they change their diet might be more complicated. Appetites fade as we age, chewing becomes more difficult and those living alone don\u2019t always feel inclined to cook. The important thing, say both Saunders and Laird, is that older people consume plenty of protein.\n\u201cOlder adults should be taking at least 1 to 1.5g of protein per kilogram of body weight,\u201d says Laird. \u201cDairy, fish or non-processed meat can help maintain muscle strength and function, reducing the risk of frailty as we age.\u201d\nIn truth, anyone over 50 would do well to follow these simple guidelines: engage with something new every day, take a daily walk of at least 20 minutes, socialise regularly, take a daily multivitamin for seniors and check the protein content of our meals. Perhaps we should think of it as self-parenting.\nGood groups for elders\nAge UK has a database of social activities and groups for older folk\nThe Walking Football Association keeps keen amateur footballers playing long into their 50s and 60s\nAction for Elders offers social and exercise programmes\nThe Centre for Ageing Better provides information on working and living as an older person\nu3a, a charity collective, provides local opportunities for people no longer in work to acquire new skills and knowledge\nAnnabel Streets is the co-author of The Age-Well Project: Easy Ways to a Longer, Healthier, Happier Life (Piatkus) and co-founder of The Age-Well Project\n\nThis article, authored by Annabel Streets, was published by The Guardian on 2023-10-10 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":605}
{"title":"Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a perfect end for the Switch","context":"## Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a perfect end for the Switch\n\nThe second level of Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a musical. Or, to be precise, it can be a musical. Whether or not the universe breaks into song depends on which words of the title \u201cSuper Mario Bros. Wonder\u201d you prefer.\nIf you\u2019re here for the \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d of it all, this level (and every level) can be enjoyed as a loyal continuation of the plumber\u2019s work in the 2D platformer genre that has maintained a healthy and consistent cadence since the series debuted in 1985. Dash from left to right, jump over pits, concuss enemies, collect the occasional power-up, and after a few minutes of adventuring ever eastward, leap onto the flagpole that ends one level and unlocks the next.\nPolygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it\u2019s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun \u2014 and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch .\nBut, if you\u2019re curious about the \u201cWonder\u201d \u2014 if you\u2019re not too precious about video game tradition \u2014 you can find within each Wonder stage a Wonder Seed, a Mario-sized ball of botany that morphs the environment into something indeed quite wonderful. Like a musical number.\nTo choose wonder is to flood the atmosphere with lava-lamp plasma, send gravity into convulsions, or transform your hero into any variety of creatures \u2014 or even inanimate objects. As my stoned college roommate once postulated while ripping an apple bong: \u201cYou always see the scenery, but have you ever wanted to be the scenery?\u201d Reader, he dreamt so we could live. For a moment, Mario gets to be the background.\nThe brilliance of Super Mario Bros. Wonder is that the choice is one of \u201cand,\u201d not of \u201cor.\u201d The traditional and the topsy-turvy coexist. Across six worlds, the creators of Wonder offer a menu of familiar stages that, should you like, can be prepared with extra spice \u2014 or paired with the family-friendly equivalent of ayahuasca. That particular drug comparison isn\u2019t flippant: At one point Toad licks the ol\u2019 Wonder Seed, and suddenly he\u2019s riding a dragon.\nWonder Seeds can add a splash of difficulty, but help is perpetually available in a fashion that\u2019s considerate rather than patronizing. Gone are time limits. Extra lives can be purchased at a low cost with the game\u2019s abundant purple currency. A new badge system allows players to select from a growing collection of special abilities that range from helpful (a high, floating leap) to playful (a Piranha Plant grappling hook) to silly (a triple jump tied to a musical rhythm).\nPrince charming Badges are worn by a little royal bug named Prince Florian who joins you on your journey and provides the majority of conversation on this road trip, alongside very talkative flowers sprouting across every corner of the Flower Kingdom, eager to provide a tip for a metatextual wink.\nEach unlockable upgrade or special move is assigned to a badge that can be found or purchased. One collected badge can be selected before each stage, so I found myself rotating abilities based on need. For example, when later stages added a bunch of instant-death bottomless pits, I opted for the Safety Bounce badge: When I plunge into an abyss, the darkness spits me up like a piece of hamburger caught in its throat.\nI expect many players will brag that their favorite badge is the \u201coverpowered one,\u201d which is sort of always true. No matter what you use, you will feel like you\u2019ve been given an unfair advantage as you casually float over chunks of the stage or vacuum coins through walls. To maintain balance, the designers layered on new challenges, keeping Wonder within the Goldilocks window. Not too hard, not too easy. Just right.\nThe wonder of playing Super Mario Bros. in 1985 came from the discovery. Nintendo not only predicted players would climb outside the confines of the level, it placed shortcuts in the hidden crevices to reward the most rule-breaking players. Badges cleverly build upon that sense of freedom with skills that let you soar over towering enemies or use that Piranha Plant grappling hook to climb high above the confines of the stage \u2014 now a Mario tradition.\nAnd sometimes Wonder goes further. With Wonder Seeds, the levels themselves collapse and contort, disobeying the laws established by decades of Mario games. Giant, sudsy, rainbow-tinted bubbles fill a stage and burst through the ceiling; a colossal snowball knocks down a flagpole, extending the stage beyond its official conclusion.\nThis is the most significant difference between 1985 and 2023: Mario\u2019s creators have joined in the fun of breaking the machine.\nPlay Mario for the first time a second time\nMiddle-aged Mario fans (read: me) have speculated since its announcement that Wonder could be the first \u201ctrue new Mario game\u201d since Super Mario World in 1990.\nTo younger (or just less obsessive) readers, that theory might sound strange. Nintendo has released many iterative entries of Mario \u2014 including the cheekily named New Super Mario Bros. series. However, for the village elders, the first four 2D Mario games stand apart.\nMario multiplayer Wonder shines as a solo experience, but like other recent 2D Mario games, Wonder allows up to four players to play together. Multiplayer is both a delight and utter chaos. The humanoid characters (Mario, Peach, Toad, etc.) are like M&Ms \u2014 they have different exteriors but effectively play the same. The critters are perfect for players who prefer a little extra help. Nabbit and Yoshi won\u2019t take damage, and the Yoshis have their familiar tongue attack and floaty jump.\nWith each Super Mario Bros. on the NES and SNES, Nintendo\u2019s designers learned from the previous entry, cutting what didn\u2019t work, making audacious additions (there was a time when adding a dinosaur named Yoshi felt like a gimmick!), and gradually accumulating the pieces and tropes that would appear in every game for the following 30-plus years.\nThen, with Super Mario 64, 3D Mario games became the de facto labs for Nintendo\u2019s greatest experimentation: Magical hats! Water guns! Galactic travel! 2D Mario, conversely, defaulted to a vessel for nostalgia.\nI can say with confidence that Wonder shares those early games\u2019 inventiveness, and their disregard for what should and shouldn\u2019t be in a Mario game. When playing Wonder, I\u2019ve imagined how it came to be: In my fantasy, since the \u201990s, every time a Nintendo developer had an idea that \u201cdidn\u2019t fit the tone\u201d or \u201cwasn\u2019t Mario enough,\u201d they wrote it into a notebook. And eventually, with no space left, someone had the gall to say, \u201cLet\u2019s turn this stuffed notebook of chaos into a game. Because why shouldn\u2019t Mario be an elephant? Why shouldn\u2019t Wigglers wear roller skates? And why shouldn\u2019t Luigi skydive?\u201d\nWonder\u2019s creators have so many new ideas to share that their creativity is unapologetically wasteful, which I say as a compliment. Many gimmicks in Super Mario Bros. Wonder could be stretched to fill entire games, but here, we\u2019re lucky to see them last a few minutes.\nFor example, one stage might feature platforms that drop when you step on them. The next stage will feature platforms that drop, but only after you\u2019ve jumped on them a certain number of times \u2014 a countdown clock at their center. After that, the stage will have platforms made of batteries, each dropping as it runs out of energy. And then, to wrap things up, there will be a stage in which you build the stage out of huge batteries of different shapes, the platform rapidly growing and shrinking as it skims above a yawning abyss.\nIn the current era of AAA \u201cforever games\u201d filled with endless lists of chores and artificial rewards, Wonder\u2019s willingness to juice each idea of its fun, then toss the rind in the trash, is a potent alternative. The reward isn\u2019t XP or limited-edition outfits. It\u2019s the play itself.\nDon\u2019t mistake the creative abundance (and refusal to wear out one\u2019s welcome) for a short game. Levels are everywhere. Wonder\u2019s map features six worlds, but levels can also be found in the hub area, along with... to avoid spoilers, let\u2019s just say elsewhere. The familiar rhythms of a Mario game have been broken, with bosses appearing without warning, some worlds ending with no boss fight at all, and the occasional surprise stage that materializes like a mirage.\nWhether or not Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the unofficial Super Mario Bros. 5 that dorks like me have long wanted, I\u2019ll leave to the forums. But I will say this: What a joy it is to play a Mario game and not already know how to read it, to not have my muscle memory do more work than my brain.\nWith rumors that the Nintendo Switch\u2019s successor could arrive early next year, I would be fine if Wonder were this console\u2019s last big release. To survive after the Wii U, Nintendo had to bring together its console and handheld designers and create something unlike anything on the market, without sacrificing what had gotten the company to that point. As the sun sets on the Switch, after an unprecedented run of success, along with arguably the best entries in many of the company\u2019s biggest franchises, we get Super Mario Bros. Wonder.\nLike the Switch itself, Wonder is a collision between the traditional and the new. A game that\u2019s the same as it ever was and nothing like Mario has ever been.\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder will be released Oct. 20 on Nintendo Switch. The game was reviewed on Nintendo Switch using a pre-release download code provided by Nintendo. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

Also, a lot of people who are very cranky with Mint, and trust me, I feel you on that.\nOne note before we get into it: you should, of course, be careful about where you manage your money and financial information and to whom you give access to any of that data. Many of the apps we\u2019re about to talk about are popular and highly regarded, but you should always be cautious with this stuff. My credit score also once got dinged because I had signed up for too many personal finance apps \u2014 true story \u2014 so there are lots of reasons to be thoughtful here.\nCool? Cool. Let\u2019s run through some of your ideas and findings:\nYNAB is the big winner. YNAB, which stands for You Need A Budget, was the overwhelming most popular recommendation I got this week. Folks liked that you can sync all your accounts and cards, that it\u2019s an independent app you pay for instead of being bombarded by ads and credit card deals, and that it has a specific set of principles and systems you can just pick up and start using.\nYNAB, which stands for You Need A Budget, was the overwhelming most popular recommendation I got this week.

Copilot is the other go-to. Copilot is much more polished than YNAB, and people love the app\u2019s design, its dataviz tools, and just how easy it is to interact with. It\u2019s only for iOS and Mac, which is unfortunate, but as finance apps go, it seems to be unbeatably fun to use.\nCopilot is much more polished than YNAB, and people love the app\u2019s design, its dataviz tools, and just how easy it is to interact with.

Don\u2019t sleep on spreadsheets.

Or maybe just use your bank. A lot of banks now offer budget tools from right within your banking app, so you can manage your money right next to where it lives. (I hear good things about SoFi\u2019s features on this front.) If you do most or all of your banking in one place, a few folks said this is the way.\nPersonally, after reading all your notes and doing some research, I\u2019m going to give Copilot a run. I\u2019ve tried YNAB in the past, and it\u2019s great, but I just did a bad job keeping up with it. I\u2019m also going to make an epic 2024 budget spreadsheet and see how far that gets me.\nScreen share\nKevin Nguyen, a deputy editor at The Verge, warned me when I first asked him to do this that he had four different writing apps on his homescreen. To which I said: sold, bring it on, we love an obsessive homescreen setup.\nThen Kevin followed up and said, \u201cOh, sorry, it\u2019s actually five writing apps.\u201d Kevin gets it. Here\u2019s Kevin\u2019s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:\nThe phone: iPhone 15 Pro (already lightly scratched my screen).\nThe wallpaper: My background is actually my partner, but she would be mortified if I posted a photo of her here, next to a bunch of apps, so you guys just get Toshiro Mifune.\nThe apps: Years ago, I read this interview with novelist Donna Tartt about her writing process. I assumed, as a famous person of letters, she would have an elaborate, possibly pretentious system \u2014 at least an especially fancy leather Moleskine. It turns out she just kept four different notebooks: cheap ones, sporting different Beatles album covers, each serving a different purpose. I forgot what each was for, but it was something like \u201cRevolver is for characters, Sgt. Pepper\u2019s is for plot.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know if I was channeling Tartt when I decided to regularly use a rotation of five different writing apps. They are iA Writer, Google Docs, Bear, Apple Notes, and Scrivener, and they all have more weaknesses than strengths. Each feels like it\u2019s been designed for a fairly specific use case. But that\u2019s not really the point. I know that when I open iA Writer, it\u2019s to try and get words down as quickly as possible. Docs is for revising and fidgeting. Bear is for thoughtful notes. Notes is for garbage notes (I really hate that app, but it also syncs our household grocery list). Scrivener is its own beast, built from the ground up for real sickos (authors).\nI\u2019m sure five apps that do essentially the same thing sounds like a nightmare to some people. But for me, writing and editing is a messy process, like trying to capture lightning in a bottle. Or I guess, in this case, five different bottles.\nNon-writing apps: Wallet, Google Authenticator, Photos, Camera, Google Maps, Settings, Clock, Chase, Arc (the iOS app is fairly incomplete, but it will sync with your sidebar, so I\u2019ll open a bunch of tabs, then read those links on my phone when I get on the subway), Slack, Hello Weather (my salvation since the death of Dark Sky), Pins (I use Pinboard to save longform stories, and I meticulously tag them with the kind of notes you might expect from a features editor), Letterboxd (quietly the best social app and a great way to triangulate what\u2019s out, streaming, or in theaters \u2014 if two or three friends have all logged an older film recently, it probably means it just hit Criterion or there\u2019s a revival at IFC).\nAs always, I also asked Kevin to share a few things he\u2019s into right now. Here\u2019s what he sent back:\nSurround by Hiroshi Yoshimura . This recently released ambient record was originally made to be the music of\u2026 prefab homes? But it reveals so much on closer listen: shimmering drone, swirls of pleasing synths, a touch of humor. Still, if you\u2019re lazy like I am most days, you can just put it on while you work and let it wash over you.\nThis recently released ambient record was originally made to be the music of\u2026 prefab homes?

{"title":"Meta to offer ad-free subscription in Europe in bid to keep tracking other users","context":"## Meta to offer ad-free subscription in Europe in bid to keep tracking other users\n\nMeta is to offer an ad-free subscription version of Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, EEA (European Economic Area) and Switzerland, confirming the core of a report in the WSJ earlier this month. The new ad-free subscription will be available from next month, per a Meta blog post.\nThe move follows years of privacy litigation, enforcements and court rulings in the EU \u2014 which have culminated in a situation where Meta can no longer claim a contractual right (nor legitimate interest) to track and profile users for ad targeting. (Although, at the time of writing, it is still doing the latter \u2014 meaning it is technically operating without a proper legal basis. But this summer Meta announced an intention to switch to consent.)\nUnder regional data protection law the only available basis left for Meta\u2019s tracking and profiling ad business is to obtain freely given consent from users. However the adtech giant\u2019s interpretation of free consent with this \u2018pay us or be tracked\u2019 subscription proposal will, justifiably, leave privacy advocates fuming \u2014 since the choice it\u2019s offering here boils down to \u2018pay us money; or pay us with your privacy\u2019.\nPer Meta\u2019s blog post, the fee it plans to charge users to escape its tracking and targeting (i.e. the ad-free subscription) is \u20ac9.99\/month on web or \u20ac12.99\/month on iOS or Android per linked Facebook and Instagram accounts in a user\u2019s Accounts Center. After March 1, 2024 it also says an additional fee \u2014 of \u20ac6\/month on web and \u20ac8\/month on iOS or Android \u2014 will apply for each additional account listed in a user\u2019s Account Center.\nSo the cost for using Meta\u2019s services without being tracked and profiled could quickly stack up for anyone with more than one account on Meta\u2019s social networks.\nEven for a user with just one account (on either Facebook or Instagram) the cost for protecting their privacy from Meta\u2019s tracking and profiling would be almost \u20ac120 per year (for web use) or just over \u20ac155 (on mobile).\nAs we reported earlier this month, Meta is relying on a line in a ruling handed down by the bloc\u2019s top court, the CJEU, earlier this year \u2014 where the judges allowed the possibility \u2014 caveated with \u201cif necessary\u201d \u2014 of an (another caveat) \u201cappropriate fee\u201d being charged for an equivalent alternative service (i.e. that lacks tracking and profiling). So the legal fight against Meta\u2019s continued tracking and profiling of users will hinge on what\u2019s necessary and appropriate in this context.\nnoyb, the European privacy rights group which has driven much of the strategic litigation against Meta\u2019s tracking and profiling, has already \u2014 since 2021 \u2014 been challenging similar \u2018pay or okay\u2019 practices by news publishers by filing a series of complaints with data protection authorities.\nIn a press release earlier this month after the WSJ reported Meta plans to charge users for their privacy, noyb\u2019s founder and honorary chairman, Max Schrems, wrote: \u201cThe CJEU said that the alternative to ads must be \u2018necessary\u2019 and the fee must be \u2018appropriate\u2019. I don\u2019t think \u20ac160 a year is what they had in mind. These six words are also an \u2018obiter dictum\u2019, a non-binding element that went beyond the core case before the CJEU. For Meta this is not the most stable case law and we will clearly fight against such an approach.\u201d\nContacted for a response to the development, Meta\u2019s lead regulator in the EU for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC) sent us a statement. \u201cMeta notified the DPC on July 27 of its intention to implement an alternative, consent-based model in which users would be given a choice between ads-funded versions of its platforms, and subscription versions in which, in return for payment of monthly fee, it is said that users will not receive targeted advertising,\u201d the Irish regulator wrote.\n\u201cWhile February 2024 was initially identified by Meta as the earliest date by which its consent model would be operational, it agreed to bring forward that date to November 2023 at the direction of the DPC, the DPC having been concerned to ensure that changes would be implemented to the platforms as soon as practicable in light of earlier findings to the effect that Meta had failed to demonstrate its entitlement to rely on the legal bases on which it was then relying when processing users\u2019 data for behavioural advertising purposes. These included findings made by the Court of Justice of the European Union when delivering judgment on July 4, 2023 in a case in which the Court examined the legal bases on which Meta\u2019s processing of users\u2019 data for behavioural advertising purposes is grounded.\n\u201cActing in consultation with its fellow European supervisory authorities, the DPC has been engaged in a detailed regulatory assessment of the consent-based model since it was first proposed by Meta in July. That exercise is being led by the DPC, reflecting its position as Lead Supervisory Authority for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The exercise has not yet concluded, and no findings have been made to date. It is due to be completed shortly, at which point the DPC will notify Meta if it considers that the manner in which its new user offerings are to be implemented is compatible with Meta\u2019s obligations under GDPR.\u201d\nSo Meta\u2019s move to offer users a subscription or tracking hasn\u2019t been signed off by data protection authorities as yet \u2014 and it\u2019s clear that further regulatory interventions could follow. (And on that front, Norway\u2019s DPA, which has a local ban order on Meta\u2019s tracking ads, told us it\u2019s concerned about the subscription plan, saying it has doubts as to whether it would constitute valid consent.)\nAs well as needing to comply with the GDPR, which delineates the qualities necessary for consent to be legal (such as that it is specific, informed and freely given), Meta is now also subject to the pan-EU Digital Services Act (DSA) \u2014 which also sets conditions on larger platforms when it comes to tracking and profiling people for ads. So it won\u2019t just be data protection authorities making a call on whether Meta\u2019s subscription or tracking offer flies; the European Commission is responsible for oversight of very large online platforms\u2019 DSA compliance.\nMeta has also been designated as a so-called gatekeeper, under the DSA\u2019s sister regulation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) \u2014 which also puts some limits on use of people\u2019s data for ads. The Commission is the sole enforcer of the DMA.\nMeta is already in the Commission\u2019s sights over its approach to the DSA \u2014 with the EU\u2019s executive, in recent days, requesting more information from the tech giant vis-\u00e0-vis its approach to content threats flowing from the Israel-Hamas war and about election security issues. But it remains to be seen whether the EU will apply the same close scrutiny to Meta\u2019s ad tracking offer.\nIn its blog post Meta claims the choice to offer people to pay it for their privacy or else agree to being tracked \u201cbalances the requirements of European regulators while giving users choice and allowing Meta to continue serving all people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland\u201d. But, well, it would say that.\nThe subscription is also only being offered to people aged 18 and up \u2014 which raises questions over how it will comply with requirements in the DSA and DMA not to processing children\u2019s data for ad targeting.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to explore how to provide teens with a useful and responsible ad experience given this evolving regulatory landscape,\u201d it writes on that.\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":608}
