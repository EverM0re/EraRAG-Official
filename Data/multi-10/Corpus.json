{"title":"Beeper reversed engineered iMessage to bring blue bubble texts to Android users","context":"## Beeper reversed engineered iMessage to bring blue bubble texts to Android users\n\nThe push to bring iMessage to Android users today adds a new contender. A startup called Beeper, which had been working on a multi-platform messaging aggregator, is now launching a new app called Beeper Mini which will allow Android users to send and receive end-to-end encrypted iMessage chats for just $1.99 per month. Beeper Mini was made possible because the team behind the app has managed to reverse-engineer the iMessage protocol, they say.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big breakthrough,\u201d explains Beeper co-founder and CEO Eric Migicovsky, previously the founder of smartwatch startup Pebble. \u201cWe\u2019re not actually a middleman anymore. The research that we\u2019ve done is actually reverse-engineering the iMessage protocol, down to the lowest layer of the protocol. So Beeper Mini doesn\u2019t use a Mac server as a relay like all the other apps \u2014 they have a Mac Mini in a data center somewhere. And when you send a message, you\u2019re actually sending a message to the Mac Mini, which then forwards it to iMessage,\u201d he explains. \u201cBeeper Mini is a native implementation of the iMessage protocol.\u201d\nBeeper does not have access to the contents of users\u2019 messages, the company claims. And unlike the recently paused efforts by Sunbird, which had been trying to solve the same problem, messages are not sent in clear text.\nInstead, the message you send from an Android phone using Beeper Mini is end-to-end encrypted to the recipient, the startup says. It\u2019s encrypted on the device before it leaves the app. Encryption keys are exclusively stored on your phone within the Android filesystem, similar to other apps like Signal and WhatsApp. The app doesn\u2019t connect to any servers at Beeper itself, only to Apple servers, the way a \u201creal\u201d iMessage text would.\nThat means that Beeper Mini can function as a true iMessage client, supporting high-resolution photos and videos, threads, replies, read receipts, direct messages and group chats, tapback emoji reactions, editing and unsending messages, as well as support for stickers, GIFs, voice notes and more. Not yet supported are features like live location sharing, message effects and support for FaceTime audio and video calls. Users will not need an Apple ID to use Beeper Mini.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a full-blown iMessage app,\u201d Migicovsky says. \u201cFor all intents and purposes, Beeper Mini looks like an iPhone [sent it].\u201d\nApple, then, may not be able to simply block Beeper Mini texts automatically if it wanted to take action against the company, though the co-founder admits how Apple will react is still uncertain.\nHowever, he points to a provision in copyright law, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA 1201 F), which says that reverse-engineering for the purposes of interoperability is protected. That won\u2019t necessarily prevent Apple from sending Beeper legal a Cease and Desist, of course. Apple previously sued spyware maker NSO Group to block it from using Apple\u2019s services, and it could likely make a legal case here, as well, if it chose to. What may hold it at bay is the Digital Markets App (DMA), a law in Europe that says big tech companies will have to have an interoperable interface for their chat networks. There are also stirrings of antitrust efforts in the U.S., where Apple is under federal scrutiny, which could make for bad timing to target Beeper, too.\nBut to be fully trusted, Beeper Mini will need to be audited by a third party \u2014 something it has not yet done. In addition, Beeper uses certificate pinning, which makes network traffic analysis more difficult to perform in order to verify its claims. The company says its external audit is still \u201cin progress\u201d but it has performed an internal audit. The company is publishing those results on its blog along with a detailed, more technical description of how Beeper Mini works.\nFor example, the team explains here how it needed to build a new service, called Beeper Push Notification service (BPNs), to make the service work:\nA persistent connection to APNs is needed to be notified of new incoming messages in real-time. On an iPhone, an APNs connection is maintained by the operating system, and connected at all times. In Beeper Mini, the connection can only be maintained when the app is running, since Android does not support APNs natively.\nTo work around this limitation, the team built BPNs to connect to Apple\u2019s servers on the user\u2019s behalf when the app isn\u2019t running.\nIn tests, Beeper Mini worked as described, able to send iMessage texts from an older Android phone on Google Fi\u2019s wireless network with its own phone number (not associated with an Apple ID) to an iPhone 15 Pro Max with a different phone number that is associated with an Apple ID. Full-res photos and other features like tapbacks and typing indicators also worked. When the Android phone\u2019s battery died, however, the texts reverted to green bubbles and did not make it to Beeper\u2019s app \u2014 they went to Google Messages instead.\nThe company is also hoping to gain trust by building in public, with 50-plus projects that it\u2019s published to GitHub with the open source code that goes into the app. Plus, the founders themselves are known individuals with a history of building promising tech, including the Pebble smartwatch.\nFounded in 2020, Beeper comes from former Y Combinator partner Eric Migicovsky and CTO Brad Murray, previously of wholesale marketplace startup Faire and Fitbit. The co-founders met at Pebble, the smartwatch company Migicovsky founded, building out the hardware brand that was later acquired by Fitbit.\nMigicovsky said he was inspired to build Beeper out of a personal need as a lifelong Android user.\nInitially, Beeper launched a multi-network chat app that supported around 15 different networks, including WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, Signal, Slack, Instagram, LinkedIn, Discord, Google Chat, Android SMS, iMessage and others.\n\u201cUntil I started Beeper, I didn\u2019t really understand this whole iMessage thing. I didn\u2019t really understand why people loved it so much,\u201d Migicovsky says. \u201cI think one of the reasons is that it\u2019s so deeply built into iOS, that it\u2019s second nature for you as an iPhone user. When you want to get in touch with someone, you open the Messages app.\u201d\nHis experience with messaging had differed, though, having lived in Europe and Asia at times, where he collected friends across a wider network of applications. He didn\u2019t understand the draw that iMessage had in the U.S. in particular, as he was simply left out of friends\u2019 iMessage chats for being the friend with a green bubble.\nThe original Beeper app had 50,000 sign-ups in the first week and now has around 100,000 testers in a closed beta. That app, which spans mobile and desktop, supports RCS (via Beeper\u2019s open source bridge). Beeper Mini will be able to send and receive SMS and RCS soon. The earlier Beeper will now transition to become rebranded as \u201cBeeper Cloud\u201d as the iMessage-only Beeper Mini goes to launch. Over time, Beeper Mini will add the other networks back into the platform, as well as SMS and RCS, and Beeper Cloud will be sunset. At that point, Beeper Mini will become known as just Beeper once again.\nBeeper Mini is competitively priced at $1.99 per month, with a seven-day free trial, compared with $15 per month for the recently acquired competitor Texts.com bought by Automattic. The startup says that it\u2019s able to keep costs down by targeting a wider market that includes Android, iPhone, Mac, Windows and Linux.\nHowever, Beeper also has venture capital to lean on, with $16 million raised to date through its Series A, led by Garry Tan of Initialized Capital, now president and CEO at Y Combinator. Other backers include SV Angel, Samsung Next, Liquid2 Ventures, Niv Dror from Shrug Capital, Kevin Mahaffey and others. Beeper is a 25-person distributed team, while Migicovsky is based in Palo Alto.\nAsked if Samsung\u2019s investment means the company could be interested in a later acquisition, Migicovsky only responded \u201cno comment.\u201d\n\u201cThey have been very supportive,\u201d he added.\nBeeper Mini is available to the public today on Google Play Store.\nAdditional reporting by Zack Whittaker.\nCorrection, 12\/5\/23, 2:55 PM ET: the price of Beeper Mini was listed incorrectly in one part of the article. It\u2019s $1.99\/mo, not $2.99\/mo; 12\/6\/23, 2:33 PM ET added \u201c[sent it]\u201d to clarify that the Beeper app does not look like an iPhone app.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-05 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":540}

{"title":"Liverpool enjoy home comforts but Dyche\u2019s Everton offer derby danger | Andy Hunter","context":"## Liverpool enjoy home comforts but Dyche\u2019s Everton offer derby danger | Andy Hunter\n\nThree points off the top, three goals scored in every Premier League home game, a 100% record in all competitions at Anfield, cruising through the Europa League group stage and individuals shining; it is fair to say Liverpool have surpassed the pre-season expectations of a new-look team. It is not unreasonable of J\u00fcrgen Klopp, however, to expect much more as the season develops.\n\u201cYou saw so many teams here growing in the direction we wanted and all became better step by step or the manager had to go,\u201d said Klopp on the demands of his particular job. \u201cWe will try together to get better step by step and show our real face more often than not.\u201d\nThe 243rd edition of the most played derby in English football offers an ideal opportunity for Liverpool to grant Klopp\u2019s request given the one-sided nature of the fixture on his watch, regardless of another early kick-off after an international break playing havoc with preparations. Klopp has lost one of his 17 encounters with Everton, Liverpool one of the past 23 Premier League meetings at Anfield and one of the past 25 league derbies home or away.\nLiverpool\u2019s defensive concerns, heightened by the loss of Andy Robertson for up to three months with a shoulder injury, are offset by the visitors\u2019 troubles in front of goal. A 3-0 defeat of Bournemouth last time out was only the eighth time Everton have scored more than once in a Premier League match in the past 12 months. The overall improvement in Everton\u2019s performance, however, coupled with three wins in the past four games, raises Sean Dyche hopes of capitalising on any post-international fatigue in the opposition ranks. Klopp\u2019s compliments towards Dyche and his local rivals were of the back-handed nature.\n\u201cEverton are in a good moment,\u201d he said. \u201cBurnley in their best moments [under Dyche] were a super-difficult team to play against and you can see that again; it\u2019s similar with different players. We have to be ready for second ball fights, runs in behind, a compact defence. It will be a tough one. Burnley games were always tough. We have to have football understanding, patience, put a proper shift in and take the fight.\u201d\nLast time out, Everton beat Bournemouth 3-0 \u2013 only the eighth time in the past 12 months that they have scored more than once in a league game. Photograph: Nigel French\/PA\nWhat Klopp is seeking most of all from Liverpool is consistency throughout the 90-plus minutes of a Premier League game. It was achieved in the commanding 3-0 defeat of an in-form Aston Villa early last month, a performance that carried echoes of Liverpool at their dominant best under Klopp, but other highlights, even in victory, have been interspersed with lapses. The manager believes some instability is inevitable given this summer\u2019s midfield rebuild.\n\u201cYes it is [a factor] but we\u2019ve also changed between games quite a lot because of the amount of games and we\u2019ve been interrupted by international breaks twice now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is a more settled team it doesn\u2019t make that much of a difference because we are much more used to each other and that is not the case yet. As a group we have to become consistent but you do it step by step.\n\u201cIt is not too long ago that we had the problem of performing on a really high level until we didn\u2019t perform at all any more; we were 1-0 or 2-0 up in a game and all of a sudden we came under pressure. Crazy. We had to learn to control the game. It is all the things that happen with time \u2013 there is no shortcut to that. With the signs we showed so far I am absolutely fine but I don\u2019t know the final destination, I can\u2019t even see that yet, but it is not a problem because other teams have similar problems. It is about how quick we can make the steps and that is what we are working on every day but the problem now is how could we work since Brighton [where Liverpool drew 2-2]? We had three, with a goalie, first-team players in training until Wednesday. Tomorrow we have to play with what we did so far but in general you have to gain stability bit by bit.\u201d\nIt has arrived in attack, where Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s influence has improved considerably since his match-winning cameo for the 10 men of Liverpool at Newcastle. Mohamed Salah has scored or assisted in 14 consecutive Premier League matches and Liverpool could emulate their predecessors from 1980-81 by scoring three or more goals in the opening four home league games. Stopping goals has been the problem, with Liverpool conceding first and cheaply on occasions. Klopp insists he has not built another formidable attack at the expense of a resilient defence; it is just another step Liverpool have to make.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Imagine if we kept clean sheets but didn\u2019t create. You have time for these things when you are new [to a club], when things are under average before you come in and you are 14th.

By finding stud production at modest prices, we allow ourselves plenty of remaining budget to afford elite weekly performers at other roster spots. When our studs and our sleepers hit, we usually win.\nWe do all the leg work for you -- poring over the player pools, like my daughter searching the Target Christmas catalog \u2014 then we handpick the most promising sleepers and tell you why they're worth drafting to your next DFS squad. All you have to do is choose your favorites, sit back, and relax.\nWEEK 15 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nIf daily fantasy was as easy as picking all top-end skill-position players from one week to the next, it would be a lot easier to win the milli-maker. Let's face it, in order to win big, we need to hit on some diamonds in the rough, and in order to afford a CeeDee Lamb ($9,200 on DK), we have to invest in the occasional Demarcus Robinson ($3,600).\nWe have enjoyed consistent success with our DFS sleepers and values all season. Each Tuesday, we share a big list of our hits from the previous week. \u2014 with each hit typically netting at least 16-22 fantasy points. Throughout the year, we've been consistently ahead of the game on breakouts like Puka Nacua, Kyren Williams, and Tank Dell, among many others.\nTake a look at our collection of hits from last week:\nPos. Player Wk. 14 Game DK Price Pts QB Baker Mayfield Buccaneers at Falcons $5,300 20.1 QB Russell Wilson Broncos at Chargers $5,800 19.5 QB Gardner Minshew Colts at Bengals $5,400 16.1 RB Joe Mixon Bengals vs. Colts $6,100 21.5 RB Javonte Williams Broncos at Chargers $5,800 18.1 WR Garrett Wilson Jets vs. Texans $5,500 23.1 WR Rashee Rice Chiefs vs. Bills $5,400 19.2 WR Courtland Sutton Broncos at Chargers $6,100 15.2 TE Isaiah Likely Ravens vs. Rams $3,500 19.3 DST Cleveland Browns vs. Jaguars $3,000 12.0\nNow that's what we call a strong week! We averaged over 19 DK points per position player and 18.4 per position while spending just under $5,200 per pick. Rostering that kind of cheap production allowed us to find consistent weekly studs at other positions while setting us apart from the pack through lineup variance.\nWin BIG with SuperDraft! Get a free $10 deposit when you use promo code \"TSN\"!\nLet's shower, rinse, repeat! This year, we're also incorporating SuperDraft into our weekly DFS column. For those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. So, the sleepers who carry lower salaries in DK\/FD have higher boosts on SD. The best part: SuperDraft users can roster any player with no restrictions.\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS: How to play SuperDraft\nNow, to our picks. Below we will reveal our Week 15 DFS sleepers and values at each position. Good luck, have fun, and enjoy what will undoubtedly be another wild week!\nAll player values are from DraftKings, FanDuel, and SuperDraft. All stats are from NFL.com and Pro Football Reference.\nNFL DFS Picks Week 15: QB sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft\nBrock Purdy, 49ers at Cardinals (DK: $6,800 | FD: $8,400 | SD: 1.2x)\nWe usually don't feature players with salaries higher than $6,200 on DK and $8,000 on FD, but $6,800 on DK just seems like a massive value for the MVP frontrunner. Purdy has been scorching, with 57.9 DK points over San Francisco's past two games and at least 23.8 in five of the Niners' past six. The Cards rank among the 10 most generous defenses to QBs on DK, so we're all over the young gunslinger in the desert this weekend.\nJordan Love, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $6,200 | FD: $8,000 | SD: 1.25x)\nLove and the Packers' pass-catchers have emerged as legit offensive threats over the past month, finally easing the Cheeseheads' anguish over the departure of Aaron Rodgers. Cult hero Tommy DeVito hit the pause button on Green Bay's good times, but it should start rolling again this weekend at home against a miserable Tampa Bay secondary. The Bucs have surrendered the fourth-most FD points and fifth-most DK points to QBs this season, and Plodmaster General AJ Dillon ain't about to crack their strong front-seven. We love Love this weekend, and not just because we're lovers at heart.\nOther solid Week 15 values: Matthew Stafford, Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $6,000 | FD: $7,200 | SD: 1.3x); Derek Carr, Saints vs. Giants (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x); Joe Flacco, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $5,500 | FD: $7,100 | SD: 1.35x); Will Levis, Titans vs. Texans (DK: $5,400 | FD: $6,800 | SD: 1.35x)\nWEEK 15 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nNFL DFS Picks Week 15: RB sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft\nDevin Singletary, Texans at Titans (DK: $5,400 | FD: $6,000 | SD: 1.35x)\nWith C.J. Stroud in the league's concussion protocol and Nico Collins (calf) joining Tank Dell (fibula) on the Texans' injury list, Houston suddenly finds itself without many impact skill-position players. Singletary, however, has been pretty damn good and showed us last week that he's the main man over Dameon Pierce in DeMeco Ryans' backfield. He had 13 carries for 65 yards and a TD against the Jets, while Pierce totaled just five touches for seven yards. Don't be scared of Tennessee's run D because it ain't what it used to be under Mike Vrabel. Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane just posted 35.1 PPR points against the Titans, Chuba Hubbard had 20.2 a few weeks ago, and Rachaad White had 17.8 against them in Week 10.\nAntonio Gibson, Commanders at Rams (DK: $5,200 | FD: $5,600 | SD: 1.4x)\nAaron Donald and friends will be attacking the pocket early and often in pursuit of Sam Howell, who has been sacked 10 more times than any other QB. Dump-offs and screens will be plentiful for Gibson, who comes at a major discount, at least in PPR formats.\nMore solid Week 15 RB values: Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots vs. Chiefs (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x); Jerick McKinnon, Chiefs at Patriots (DK: $5,100 | FD: $5,500 | SD: 1.45x); Jordan Mason, 49ers at Cardinals (DK: $4,600 | FD: $4,200 | SD: 1.6x); Tyler Allgeier, Falcons at Panthers (DK: $4,400 | FD: $5,700 | SD: 1.6x)\nWEEK 15 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nNFL DFS Picks Week 15: WR sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft\nRashee Rice, Chiefs at Patriots (DK: $6,100 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x)\nWith Isiah Pacheco (shoulder) banged up, Rice seems like Kansas City's best skill-position player this side of Travis Kelce. He's certainly the most sure-handed wideout on the Chiefs (not saying much, but still), and he has electric after-the-catch playmaking ability (which is good, considering Patrick Mahomes has struggled with deep-ball accuracy). The rookie has quietly posted 57.3 PPR points over the past three weeks! Since Bill Belichick's defense typically makes it a point to neutralize the opposition's top threat, which is obviously Kelce this weekend, look for Rice to bust some chunk-yard plays through the screen game and dump-downs.\nRomeo Doubs, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $5,300 | FD: $6,400 | SD: 1.45x)\nDoubs has been one of the more dependable offensive weapons in Green Bay's offense, and Tampa Bay's secondary has been utterly abysmal all season, so we're rolling with the young wideout in a handful of lineups this weekend. Doubs has a good floor, logging 11-plus DK points eight times, and a decent ceiling (at least 18.3 three times). Fire him up in what should be a pass-heavy matchup at Lambeau.\nDemarcus Robinson, Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $3,600 | FD: $5,600 | SD: 1.7x)\nRobinson has become one of Matthew Stafford's most trusted receivers, drawing a 21.8-percent target share over the past two weeks. And the veteran has made the most of his opportunities, collecting seven catches for 101 yards and two TDs during that span. The Commanders are terrible at defending the pass \u2014 even worse than they were earlier in the season since they shipped out multiple impact pass-rushers. Washington has surrendered the most FanDuel points and second-most DraftKings points to wide receivers this season. Run DMC into your DFS lineups this weekend.\nMore solid Week 15 WR values: Amari Cooper, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $6,000 | FD: $7,200 | SD: 1.35x); Garrett Wilson, Jets at Dolphins (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,900 | SD: 1.4x); Brandin Cooks, Cowboys at Bills (DK: $5,200 | FD: $6,300 | SD: 1.45x); A.T. Perry, Saints vs. Giants (DK: $3,500 | FD: $4,700 | SD: 1.7x)\nWEEK 15 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best stacks\nNFL DFS Picks Week 15: TE sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft\nDavid Njoku, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $4,700 | FD: $6,200 | SD: 1.3x)\nNjoku went nuclear last weekend, catching six of his eight targets from Joe Flacco for 91 yards and two touchdowns. Now he gets a chance for an encore against the Bears, who have surrendered the 10th-most PPR points to tight ends this season. No joke, dude \u2014 you can trust Njoku!\nMore solid Week 15 TE values: Logan Thomas, Commanders at Rams (DK: $3,700 | FD: $5,100 | SD: 1.5x); Cade Otton, Buccaneers at Packers (DK: $3,200 | FD: $5,200 | SD: 1.65x); Tucker Kraft, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $3,000 | FD: $4,700 | SD: 1.8x)\nNFL DFS Picks Week 15: D\/ST sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel\nLos Angeles Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $3,100 | FD: $4,300)\nThe Rams got destroyed by MVP candidate Lamar Jackson and the high-flying Ravens in Week 14, but push that out of your memory banks. Before that game, Sean McVay's squad had surrendered 20 or fewer points in four straight contests. Aaron Donald and company also have 17 sacks and six takeaways over their past six games, so they'll be licking their chops looking across the line at Sam Howell this weekend. No QB has more interceptions than Howell, who has also taken 10 more sacks than any other signal-caller this season.\nMore solid Week 15 D\/ST plays: Chicago Bears at Browns (DK: $3,300 | FD: $4,100); New York Jets at Dolphins (DK: $2,700 | FD: $3,600); New England Patriots vs. Chiefs (DK: $2,300 | FD: $3,200)\n\nThis article, authored by Sloan Piva, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-13 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":544}
{"title":"Can anyone survive Fortnite as a job?","context":"## Can anyone survive Fortnite as a job?\n\n\u201cI feel like the majority of my life has been in front of a screen,\u201d Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney reflected amid tears. A fateful kill against Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins back in 2019 had catapulted Tenney to fame, and his audience went on to outgrow that of Twitch\u2019s most mainstream star. Yet in 2022, Fortnite\u2019s golden boy \u2014 whose name is synonymous with the battle royale game\u2019s most recognizable character, Jonesy \u2014 called it quits. For many, Tenney\u2019s retirement video was a sign of yet another Twitch star grappling with burnout: sad, yet familiar. In essence, though, Tenney walking away from it all cemented the end of an era for the games industry.\nPolygon is celebrating TwitchCon 2023 with a package of stories covering streaming trends and news from the show. Check it out!\nTenney was the real deal, a perfect nexus of undeniable charisma and tenacious talent on display at least eight hours a day for years. But his ascent was a complicated one that reflected many of gaming\u2019s biggest growing pains during the influencer era. Tenney came up as an early Fortnite esports champion; we now know that esports is a bubble that\u2019s burned millions of dollars. Tenney rode a Fortnite wave that raised billions of dollars for Epic Games; a few years later, the publisher laid off 830 of its employees. When Tenney blew up, everyone was salivating over Drake and what his livestream appearance signaled for Twitch\u2019s future; now both the rapper and many of the platform\u2019s stars are better known for promoting gambling over hits. Tenney spurred headlines after joining FaZe Clan, a gaming lifestyle brand so lucrative it was endorsed by celebrities like Snoop Dogg; FaZe Clan is now an infamous penny stock that tried to rip him off, Tenney says.\nWhere all these disasters converge is Twitch, the livestreaming platform that\u2019s home to over 30 million daily viewers. Many would say the writing is on the wall for Twitch, after endless headlines about losing top talent, poor management, bad platform policies, and creator burnout. But the idea that Twitch has lost its way after an ostensible golden era is an easy narrative that misses something much starker. If Twitch is in trouble in 2023, it\u2019s not because things have gotten worse. Everything you\u2019re seeing is the natural progression of an unsustainable system. The prognosis has always been terminal; we\u2019ve just refused to see it because it\u2019s been profitable.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for publishers to see that Twitch could make or break a game. Around 2018, Twitch and its personalities turned Fortnite into a juggernaut so powerful, much of the gaming industry started molding itself in its image. While an approachable aesthetic and surprising gameplay made for good viewing, what kept Fortnite from being a mere fad was the model. Before, content expansions and adjustments could take months, if not years, to hit, and you might have to shell out money to see any of it. Fortnite set a more cutthroat standard: free weekly content updates.\nEpic could swing this ceaseless delivery because the bulk of its profits at the time came from its engine, which many games \u2014 including Fortnite\u2019s competitors \u2014 license. It was these deep pockets that made Fortnite possible in the first place: The bubbly shooter was initially a flop before Epic perfected the formula. The cadence also let Epic quickly adapt Fortnite to whatever was trending or novel, whether that was Among Us or Splatoon. Much like Roblox, Fortnite became a game that could give you anything \u2014 and if Epic didn\u2019t emulate it, the players would.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t replicate Fortnite\u2019s growth from, like, the [content creator] standpoint and also definitely from the developer standpoint,\u201d says a Twitch streamer turned game developer who requested anonymity because he isn\u2019t authorized to discuss the popular AAA live-service shooter that he works on.\nThe conditions that made everything possible were unique, yet immaterial to publishers who could only imagine profits. Suddenly, \u201clive service\u201d was everywhere \u2014 and games like Overwatch, which couldn\u2019t achieve a similar pace, were posed as disappointments by content creators.\nDoes an average player truly need their favorite game to give them something new, week in and week out? Developers say getting half of their players to actually finish games is unusual and worth celebrating, because the reality is that most people will never finish a game they start. Twenty-two percent of purchased games on Steam are unplayed outright. A number of things affect these percentages, like being a part of a sale or Game Pass, but the statistics still paint a picture. A reported 25% of players between the ages of 18 and 34 enjoy games between three and six hours a week, 28% play two hours or less, and 19% play between 13 to 24 hours or more, according to Statista. As they get older, fans apparently spend less time in games. In the most engaged age group, half of all players only log a couple of hours or so per week in their favorite games.\nA serious Twitch streamer who goes live daily or logs a full workday during their schedule will typically play much, much more than the people who are watching them. Twitch streamers can\u2019t stop; a mere two-day pause might mean losing thousands of paying subscribers. There\u2019s a big incentive to keep up with live-service updates as well. There\u2019s some FOMO involved; while certain events with special prizes happen yearly, other big occasions, like season finales, only happen once. But the numbers don\u2019t lie: Your viewership will definitely be impacted by new patches that float the game in question to Twitch\u2019s front page.\n\u201cMultiplayer games will start decreasing in viewership after the first week as the launch hype dies down and then it\u2019s a question of how good the game is perceived to be that will determine its long term fate,\u201d says StreamElements\u2019 public relations director Chase. \u201cWith those in for the long haul, viewership tends to plateau and then spike when new content and patches are released or if it is supported by competitive events.\u201d\nWhile the playing habits of a Twitch streamer don\u2019t represent the average player by any means, content creators certainly shape public opinion about games.\n\u201cNegative sentiment is very profitable,\u201d says the AAA game developer, who noted that social media platforms are built to highlight popular \u2014 and sometimes caustic \u2014 content. This dynamic sets up an inherent tension between game developers and hardcore players like Twitch streamers, who are not the main audience of most games but are often some of the most visible players.\n\u201cI don\u2019t at all think that streamers are embodying some typical player behaviors, like \u2018Brandon,\u2019\u201d the developer continues, posing a name for an imaginary everyday consumer. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a model of consumers nowadays who probably parrot those sentiments. They did not arrive at those conclusions themselves.\u201d\n\u201cThere is inherently [a] vicious and negative cycle for everyone involved, for how live service interacts with Twitch as a medium\u201d\nThe misinformation will vary, but Twitch both shapes that discourse while also becoming the very metric that people use to make sense of a game\u2019s situation. It\u2019s gotten so bad that people scrutinize Twitch longevity for single-player games, not just live-service or multiplayer ones.\nAnd so, to keep up with expectations, games as a whole are getting longer \u2014 and more expensive. It takes multiple studios to keep yearly live-service franchises like Call of Duty afloat, as noted in the CMA\u2019s report on Activision Blizzard. That same report says that the development budget of a AAA game can range anywhere from $80 million to $380 million, and seasonal updates in particular require anywhere from $50 million to $65 million to produce. For publishers, keeping up with the competition requires nearly as much money as making a big-budget game in the first place. For contrast, a modern Tomb Raider game had a budget between $75 million and $100 million, not counting marketing costs.\nMarketing by itself has eye-popping numbers as well: A 2018 report noted that the marketing budgets alone for some titles can equal 75% to 100% of what was spent on development, effectively doubling the total production cost. The channels publishers will pursue are varied, but Twitch streamers command a percentage of it. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen a shift toward personality-based promotion, with more and more publishers eschewing traditional press at launch in favor of coverage they can control. Blevins, by himself, apparently commanded a $1 million payday for streaming Apex Legends, a game that\u2019s popularity can be attributed to its enormous Twitch-focused launch.\nWho can actually compete in the environment all of these conditions have created? Giant publishers who make live-service games, mostly. All 10 of the most-watched games on Twitch in 2022 were live-service games with regular updates. And the cost goes beyond money. As Fortnite took off, developers at Epic Games said that they experienced months of crunch that required 70-to-100-hour weeks to produce that industry-shaping content despite the publisher\u2019s deep pockets. That\u2019s the model that a lot of this hinges on, an egregious work week that often still requires the cheap benefits of outsourcing and contractors who are routinely laid off. Things haven\u2019t changed much since 2019 at some major studios: Diablo 4\u2019s developers say they also underwent crunch to ship the game. Naturally, the action role-playing game had Twitch integration from the jump, and alongside a detailed content roadmap. There\u2019s little incentive for any of this to change, even as big-budget games buckle under their own weight and studios are closing left and right. Not when publishers know that the longer a player is hooked, the more likely it is that they\u2019ll spend money.\nAt this point, live-service games need content creators like Twitch streamers to stay solvent. According to the developer speaking to Polygon, streamers help old games transform into new and visible moments. Developers need live-service games to stay in the conversation, because the base experience can worsen without a persistent player base.\nIt\u2019s \u201cnot even from a cost perspective,\u201d the developer says, though obviously more players make profits more viable. \u201cBut [if] we don\u2019t have 20,000 players, then matchmaking times are terrible. Or connections will be pretty bad because we can\u2019t mobilize players together in a single match. There\u2019s all these cascading effects.\u201d\nWhile a Twitch streamer\u2019s livelihood depends on having a steady stream of content, the system taxes them, too. Tenney\u2019s goodbye to his fans was a crushing one, because the path that led him there was fueled by lost youth and a dream. Over time, the promise of a dream job \u2014 get paid to play games! \u2014 became corporatized, and contracts turned things ugly. Tenney said he started feeling trapped, and he didn\u2019t like how much his decisions started being motivated by money. Tenney is hardly alone here now that Twitch has \u201cgrown up.\u201d\n\u201cThere is inherently [a] vicious and negative cycle for everyone involved, for how live service interacts with Twitch as a medium,\u201d the game developer, who also spent years as a serious Twitch streamer, says. It\u2019s been years, but he says he\u2019s still recovering from the burnout of livestreaming all the time.\n\u201cThere [are] these enormous benefits for some people, but there\u2019s also just, like, a lot of it just really grinds you down on both sides of the table,\u201d he said, referring to game developers and Twitch streamers.\nIt was inevitable for things like sleep streams, uncapped subathons, and randomly generated AI shows to materialize on Twitch; content creators feel like they need to keep going, always\nThe burnout phenomenon has been at the forefront of Twitch\u2019s public image, in large part because it doesn\u2019t spare even the most successful creators on the platform. Twitch\u2019s most famous woman, Imane \u201cPokimane\u201d Anys, started streaming while she was still a teen. Then, it was just a hobby. Nearly a decade later, Anys grew to have one of the most impressive stints on the platform. Late in 2022, however, came a big change. She informed fans she would no longer stream all day, nor would games be her primary focus anymore. Instead, she pivoted to being more of a lifestyle and beauty personality who uploads on short-form platforms like TikTok, if and when she feels like it.\nThe evolution grew from a similar motivation as Tenney\u2019s. In the video where she explains it all, Anys said that during her time as a full-on Twitch streamer, keeping up with the \u201crat race\u201d often meant playing what was popular while being unable to do \u201cbasic human things,\u201d like going grocery shopping. How could she, when streaming all day was the norm and there was always competition around the corner that was younger and more willing to stay live for longer?\nIt was inevitable, then, for things like sleep streams, uncapped subathons, and randomly generated AI shows to materialize on Twitch; content creators feel like they need to keep going, always. Barring that, live-service games are always at the ready. In her sort-of-goodbye video, Anys spoke frankly while quickly scrolling through her entire game history on Twitch. It was all live-service games like League of Legends and Fortnite.\nIn 2011, when Twitch first launched, content creation wasn\u2019t fully a career and people still uploaded their photos to Facebook. Normal, everyday teens weren\u2019t yet decrying the hungry maw of the internet, and the generational shift toward work-life balance hadn\u2019t yet taken hold. Twitch happened at the exact right time, benefiting from a cadre of optimistic young users who grew up on the internet, happy to give away as much of themselves as they could. They didn\u2019t even realize it was happening, in many cases, and they couldn\u2019t imagine the unsustainable system it would go on to create. People were just having fun.\nThings have changed since then. Twitch has crowned millionaires, like F\u00e9lix \u201cxQc\u201d Lengyel, who wear thick diamond chains around their necks while streaming. At the same time, viewership is dropping after years of platform growth that was partially bolstered by the COVID-19 pandemic, all while top creators are streaming less. The gaming industry, which likes to boast about how much money it makes in comparison to other forms of entertainment, is laying off workers nearly every week at top studios. Meanwhile, the overall gaming market is shrinking. The cracks in the system that produces and promotes big-budget games are getting hard to ignore.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world,\u201d Tenney said in his goodbye video, which is overflowing with footage of esports casters and viewers in awe of his Fortnite plays.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this since I was a kid, man,\u201d he continued, shaking his head. \u201cI feel like my childhood and even some of my adulthood kind of flushed away. I feel like this is the end of the journey, man.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Patricia Hernandez, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-19 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":545}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nAnother infamous European night at Old Trafford. It should be a landmark low, but almost the most deflating element of this 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich was how grimly routine it all felt.\nManchester United, one of the grandest and richest names in this competition, have again gone out of the Champions League at the group stage. It is the third time it has happened since Sir Alex Ferguson, meaning it\u2019s their most common round of exit in that period.\nThe performance this season was so bad that they find themselves out of Europe altogether as the bottom team in the group, although some at the club might find solace from that. There wasn\u2019t much else. The second place they aimed for has instead gone to Copenhagen, a club with a fraction of United\u2019s budget. That is where the damage was done.\nWhile that meant there was only ever a slim hope of going through \u2013 and the Danish side\u2019s victory over Galatasaray ensured any win would be irrelevant \u2013 the club\u2019s rich legacy in this competition was built on such defiance. There was absolutely none of it here.\nThere was nothing much at all. Where was the energy? Where was the intensity? The Stretford End eventually implored United to \u201cattack attack attack\u201d but the complete absence of any such impulses eventually left some of the stadium booing the side off at the end.\nWith United out of Europe, there are questions about Erik ten Hag\u2019s ability to coach the team (AFP via Getty Images)\nThese are not the sounds we are used to hearing after that Champions League theme. Something does stir when the anthem is played at Old Trafford amid the lights. Well, for most, that is, except the players.\nThis is why there are growing questions for Erik ten Hag himself, even if everyone is constantly keen to put it in a wider context.\nManchester United should not be performing like this on what is supposed to be the classic European night at Old Trafford. This just reminded that all they are going to have for some time are their memories.\nIt was another utterly forgettable display.\nBayern, already through but perhaps looking to make a point after their own 5-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, didn\u2019t even need to step it up to win. They were quite low-intensity themselves, Kingsley Coman\u2019s winning goal coming from the forward almost walking through the middle of their team. Harry Kane, for so long billed as a potential United player, didn\u2019t score but did set it up.\nThis game showed one reason why he is at Germany\u2019s biggest club rather than England\u2019s. His side are through with ease, among the favourites for the competition even if they do look lacking in a few areas.\nHarry Kane\u2019s assist was another reminder of what could have been for United (PA)\nNot that you could judge from this game. It was almost a kickabout for them.\nBayern were still having more of the ball and the attacks. This was another tension for Ten Hag to overcome on the night. United were playing in quite a controlled way when they were going to eventually have to go for it, but Bayern were still getting through that with relative ease.\nIt meant the team almost looked like they were in two minds, to go with how thoughts were always going to be in Copenhagen. The news came through shortly before the hour that Lukas Lerager had scored for the Danish side, although it didn\u2019t really change the atmosphere or the energy. It was already a drab game, with a muted crowd.\nIt didn\u2019t help that Bruno Fernandes blazed United\u2019s best opportunity over the bar after good work from Aaron Wan Bissaka. It looked like it was going to be one of those games. It certainly wasn\u2019t one of those big European nights at Old Trafford.\nOn 71 minutes, Bayern managed what they had been half-heartedly threatening all game. They also did it at near walking pace. Kingsley Coman had weaved his way through the centre, for the ball to eventually be worked to Harry Kane. The English forward clipped an artful ball back through for Coman who finished emphatically.\nKingsley Coman\u2019s goal ensured Manchester United were knocked out of Europe (PA)\nIt was almost too easy for him. Why did Andre Onana stay so close to his line? If that sounds like the set-up for a joke\u2026 well, you can write your own punchline.\nThis is the current reality for United. They obviously have many more issues than the goalkeeper \u2013 as illustrated by the goal itself \u2013 but a strange season for Ten Hag\u2019s primary signing only continues. United\u2019s problems meanwhile combined. There were so many errors leading to the goal, to go with all of those that have characterised this entire European campaign.\nThat can now be talked about definitively, since it has been decisively ended. It is a low but just part of a decade of disappointment in the competition that has seen this club rise to its most emotional heights.\nThis game never threatened to do that. United never threatened at all. They\u2019d been involved in so many ludicrously chaotic matches that the biggest of all ended up being a non-event.\n\nThis article, authored by Simon Peach, was published by The Independent - Sports on 2023-12-12 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":546}
{"title":"What\u2019s up with Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck? Everything to know about much-hyped electric pickup","context":"## What\u2019s up with Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck? Everything to know about much-hyped electric pickup\n\nWhat\u2019s up with Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck? Everything to know about the much-hyped electric pickup\nAfter four years, the long-awaited launch of the Tesla Cybertruck electric pickup has come and gone.\nThe boxy vehicle is Tesla\u2019s first new model since 2020, when it started delivering the Model Y. Yet, Cybertruck\u2019s initial debut predates that moment; Tesla CEO Elon Musk showed off an early version of the pickup at a memorable 2019 event, when it accidentally smashed two windows while attempting to demonstrate Cybertruck\u2019s durability.\nHere we\u2019ll answer some questions we figured a brave explorer such as yourself might ask (err\u2026 type in a search bar) about Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, including details on the vehicle\u2019s specs, availability and design of the vehicle. The first deliveries, in which about 10 high-profile customers like Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian took possession of the truck, occurred November 30 at the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin.\nWhile we have lots of details it\u2019s still unclear if the Cybertruck will kick off the vehicle\u2019s journey toward success, or failure.\nWhat is the Cybertruck?\nThe Cybertruck is a steel-clad electric pickup truck made by Tesla. According to Musk, the vehicle measures fewer than 19 feet long and features a bed longer than six feet. It has four doors and room for six adults.\nTesla shared Cybertruck specs in 2019, promising three variants of the vehicle. That included a $39,900 single-motor version with rear-wheel drive and a 250-mile range. But this was eons ago, figuratively speaking. At least one variant is reported to weigh about as much as a Hummer.\nTesla is planning to offer three variants of the Cybertruck, but the prices, range and other specs have changed since 2019.\nThe cheapest Cybertruck, a single-motor rear-wheel version with 250 miles of range, a 6.9-second zero to 60 miles per hour acceleration rate, won\u2019t be available until 2025. The all-wheel drive variant has an estimated 340-mile range and top speed of 112 mph.\nThe third variant, called the Cyberbeast, has three motors that delivers 845 horsepower, a 2.6-second 0 to 60 mph acceleration rate and a top speed of 130 mph. The Cyberbeast has an estimated 320-mile range and $99,990 price tag. Both of the all-wheel drive and Cyberbeast versions have a claimed towing capacity of 11,000 pounds.\nThe company is also going to offer a range extender that will push the all-wheel drive version to an estimated 470 miles and the Cyberbeast to more than 440 miles of range. After the event, Musk took to X, formerly Twitter, to give a few more details about this add on. He said the range extender will be an \u201coptional pack that fits in about 1\/3 of the truck bed. Still room for plenty of cargo. It\u2019s meant for very long trips or towing heavy things up mountains.\u201d\nWhy does the Cybertruck look like that?\nAlso referred to as Cybrtrk in an early trademark, the Cybertruck\u2019s name, neon logo and exterior evoke a sort of cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic aesthetic. Why? Because Musk wants it to.\nThe electric pickup is made of steel, a tough material that resists rust but is hard to shape. The material\u2019s rigidity influenced the EV\u2019s starkly geometric design; it also led to launch delays and panel gaps on Cybertruck test vehicles.\nMusk has described the tank-like vehicle as \u201can armored personnel carrier from the future \u2014 what Bladerunner would have driven.\u201d Crucially, while Bladerunner is a stunning film, it depicts a horrific dystopia.\nIs the Cybertruck for sale yet?\nTesla expects to mass produce Cybertrucks starting in 2024, but unless you\u2019re a wealthy early adopter with special Tesla connections, securing a Cybertruck won\u2019t be easy early on. You\u2019ll need to get in line behind the folks who reserved the truck as far back as 2019.\nThat said, you may be able to jump ahead for a price: Apparently, Cybertruck reservations have appeared on eBay for $10,000. Proceed with caution. I\u2019m not sure how easy it\u2019d be to verify if the offers are legit, and Musk has threatened to punish resellers in the past.\nThe Cybertruck price tags varies depending on the variant and add ons. The tl;dr is that all of the considerably prices are higher than advertised back in 2019. The rear-wheel version \u2014 which, reminder isn\u2019t available until 2025 \u2014 starts at $60,990. The all-wheel drive version has a $79,990 starting price and the Cyberbeast comes in just shy of $100,000.\nThe federal tax credit for EVs has a number of eligibility requirements including price. Under current rules, the trucks and SUVs priced above $80,000 don\u2019t qualify for the $7,500 credit.\nCan I resell my Cybertruck?\nTesla indeed threatened to punish early Cybertruck resellers, but it seemed to walk back its previously published rules in a November 2023 update to its U.S. order agreement page. The rules once stated that Cybertruck customers couldn\u2019t sell their vehicles during their first year of ownership without permission from Tesla. The rules also said the company would seek $50,000 in damages from early resellers. But such language is gone from that particular page, at least for now.\nCan I fit a bike in a Cybertruck\u2019s bed?\nThat depends on the size of the bike and how you store it. From what we can tell, you\u2019ll probably need one wheel hanging over the tailgate.\nElon Musk has promised that Cybertrucks will feature beds longer than six feet. The truck bed in the production version is six-feet and slightly longer with the tailgate down. From the end of one wheel to the opposite end of the other, adult bicycles are typically longer than six feet. (On a related note, the city of Los Angeles recommends bicycle parking spaces be a minimum of six feet long, as does South Carolina\u2019s Palmetto Cycling Coalition. Regardless, it\u2019s a tight fit.)\nA motorcycle would probably be trickier. This isn\u2019t a Silverado.\nIs the Cybertruck good for the climate?\nGenerally speaking, electric vehicles are better for the climate than their gas-guzzling counterparts, because they don\u2019t have tailpipe emissions. Still, all cars are pollutive. That includes consumer EVs, since they require lithium, release tire particles into the air and demand more energy than more efficient means of getting around, such as public transit, cycling and walking. Battery material mining is also linked to worker exploitation.\nWhat about the Cybertruck\u2019s size? Experts have raised red flags over the ballooning size and weight of vehicles in the U.S. Extra-large vehicles typically require more energy, and thus more battery materials, which drives up their environmental cost. As far as collisions go, bigger and heavier vehicles are less safe for everyone around them, especially pedestrians.\nAmong EVs, vehicles with smaller batteries are generally better for the environment.\nStay tuned\nWe have a lot more questions and we expect Tesla to share more details during its November 30 delivery event. How does the Cybertruck compare to other Teslas? What about electric pickups from the competition, including Ford or GMC? When will Tesla release the cheaper, single-motor Cybertruck variant it promised back in 2019? Check back for updates as we learn more.\n\nThis article, authored by Harri Weber, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":547}
{"title":"If the Cybertruck is deadly for pedestrians, it\u2019s because all large trucks are","context":"## If the Cybertruck is deadly for pedestrians, it\u2019s because all large trucks are\n\nThe Tesla Cybertruck has been out for a little more than a week, and already people are ready to declare it a safety nightmare.\n\u201cGuideless missile\u201d and \u201cdeath machine\u201d are some of the loaded phrases being tossed around. Safety experts are \u201craising concerns\u201d about the truck\u2019s crumple zones (or lack thereof). TikTok and other social platforms are abound with videos highlighting the poor sight lines and lack of visibility for drivers and passengers.\nBut if the Cybertruck is particularly deadly for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a large truck in America in the year 2023. We have lots of data that shows that America\u2019s favorite type of vehicle is also one of the most deadly. We have very little data about the Cybertruck in particular, because it\u2019s only been out for a couple weeks and in extremely limited quantities.\nBut if the Cybertruck is particularly deadly for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a large truck in America in the year 2023\nWe need more data \u2014 and testing \u2014 before we know more about the specific dangers posed by this sharply angled, stainless steel contraption. And right now, neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) \u2014 two independent bodies that test new vehicles \u2014 have any plans to conduct crash safety tests with the Cybertruck.\nAll trucks are dangerous\nBut based on the specs we know, we can certainly draw some conclusions about the Cybertruck. Like other trucks in its segment, the Cybertruck is heavy, high-riding, very quick, and likely to be extremely deadly to anyone unlucky enough to stumble into its path.\nLast month, IIHS released a study confirming much of what we already know: trucks and SUVs with tall, flat fronts and high hoods are more deadly for pedestrians than more compact vehicles.\n\u201cTall front ends increase risk,\u201d Raul Arbelaez, VP of the IIHS Vehicle Research Center, says. \u201cFor medium height vehicles, blocky or blunt shaped front ends also increase risk. A higher point of impact increases risk for cyclists.\u201d\nThese characteristics are not unique to the Cybertruck. Trucks from Ford, GM, Toyota, Ram, and others are also extremely deadly to pedestrians. EV trucks, in particular, are more deadly due to their increased weight from the battery. And yet, for some reason, you don\u2019t see as many media stories calling out, for example, the F-150 Lightning or Rivian R1T or Chevy Silverado EV.\n\u201cVehicle weight in our fleet has continued to go up over the past 20 years,\u201d Arbelaez says. \u201cElectrification is taking weight increases to another level that will lead to dangerous outcomes.\u201d\nWe need more data\nDespite these conclusions, Arbelaez and other safety experts are taking a wait-and-see approach to the Cybertruck. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had an opportunity to measure the front-end of the Cybertruck, so we don\u2019t know how it will compare to other pickups or SUVs,\u201d he says.\nA spokesperson for Consumer Reports says the same thing: \u201cWe\u2019re going to wait for more data,\u201d citing the need for independent testing data from NHTSA and IIHS.\nTesla conducted its own crash tests with the Cybertruck in-house, videos from which were shown during the delivery event last month. But NHTSA has yet to perform its own. In the US, car companies \u201cself certify\u201d that their vehicles comply with federal safety standards requiring everything from sideview mirrors to airbags to automatic emergency braking. There is no \u201cpre-approval\u201d before an automaker is allowed to sell its cars to the public.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait for more data.\u201d\nThis allows Tesla to sell cars with driver assist systems that safety experts say put drivers and pedestrians at risk. And it allows it to sell a truck made from stainless steel and no rounded edges. The Cybertruck \u201cmeets the performance criteria\u201d for standards like lane departure warnings and dynamic brake support, according to the NHTSA website. But there is no five-star safety rating, and the Cybertruck wasn\u2019t mentioned in the agency\u2019s list of vehicles it will crash test for 2024.\nCrumple zones, or lack thereof\nSo far, the aforementioned crash test videos featured by Tesla during its delivery event have been the focus of the most questions, with many focusing on the truck\u2019s crumple zones, or lack thereof.\nThe crumple zone is the area of a vehicle that is designed to crush or crumple upon impact. Often located in the front of a vehicle, the crumple zone will absorb some of the impact of a crash, protecting the driver and other occupants.\nBy absorbing and dissipating energy, crumple zones help to prevent or reduce injuries to the occupants of the vehicle during a collision. A stiffer vehicle, perhaps one made from stainless steel, could complicate this process.\nThere are other design choices that make the Cybertruck a troubling addition to our roads.\nThere are other design choices that make the Cybertruck a troubling addition to our roads. While the hood is sloped, the corner blind spots appear to be dangerous. Tesla added cameras to compensate for these blind spots, but it\u2019s unclear what a driver will actually be able to see. The steering is digital not mechanical (\u201csteering by wire\u201d), sideview mirrors can be removed, and there is no rearview mirror at all \u2014 the only way to see what\u2019s on the side or behind is via the center console screen that\u2019s also the instrument panel, GPS mapping, Bluetooth controls, and radio. The exterior is \u201cbullet-proof\u201d steel with hardened Gorilla glass windows.\nBut again, all we have is a couple of videos. What we need is data, independently verified, before we can say definitively that this truck will cause mass death and destruction. Safety experts quoted by Reuters acknowledge there may be some shock-absorbent mechanism that makes up for the apparent lack of crumple zones. We just don\u2019t know yet.\nElon Musk is \u201chighly confident\u201d that the Cybertruck will be safer than other trucks on the road for occupants and pedestrians. Tesla has historically achieved high safety ratings thanks to its underlying architecture, which makes the car more rigid and better protects passengers. The location of the battery in the floor of the vehicle also gives the Model Y and other Tesla vehicles a lower center of gravity, which improves road stability and decreases the chances of a rollover. All four of Tesla\u2019s vehicles, the Model S, X, 3, and Y, have earned five-star ratings from Euro NCAP.\nBut the Cybertruck is a truck, and trucks are historically a nightmare for pedestrian safety. The same goes for every Ford, GMC, Hummer, and Ram truck on the road today. The underlying issues of weight, height, and dimensions are what have contributed to the current crisis in pedestrian safety, in which more people are dying on the road than any time in the last 40 years.\nThe Cybertruck is unlikely to be sold in Europe, which has a much higher bar for pedestrian safety than the US. One of Tesla\u2019s lead designers said as much in an interview with TopGear Netherlands, blaming the inflexible stainless steel exterior.\n\nThis article, authored by Andrew J.

Epic teased the return \u201cback to Chapter 1\u201d on its X account, but hinted that some more modern in-game mobility perks like sprinting would stick around even as the game turns the clock back come November 3. From the \u201cWs\u201d in the replies, Fortnite\u2019s community sounds very on board with the news.\nSprint (or Mantle, your choice) back to Chapter 1\u2026.see you soon 11.3.2023. #FortniteOG pic.twitter.com\/4LnTksppRp \u2014 Fortnite (@FortniteGame) October 27, 2023\nEpic\u2019s re-launch of Chapter 1 comes with more fanfare than your average Fortnite season. Ninja, aka Tyler Blevins, one of the first streaming superstars and still among the most popular, promoted the new content by showcasing a giant replica of one of the game\u2019s iconic Durr Burgers in his backyard. Other classic Fortnite streaming stars got the same treatment.\nWoke up to find the OG Fortnite is coming back November 3rd AND THERES A BURGER IN MY BACKYARD https:\/\/t.co\/QC3Dpr8MTr lets talk about it pic.twitter.com\/E855hGHBoN \u2014 Ninja (@Ninja) October 27, 2023\nTHERE IS NO WAY FORTNITE SENT ME THIS \ud83e\udd23@FortniteGame pic.twitter.com\/TmBvevl8aQ \u2014 timthetatman\ud83d\udc51 (@timthetatman) October 27, 2023\nFor the uninitiated, Fortnite is a battle royale-style third-person shooter where 100 players swarm a massive but shrinking virtual island with the goal of being the last man standing. In the process they generally engage in myriad well-animated virtual antics as the game has become wackier and more elaborate over time, all while dressed in custom skins you earn by playing or purchase in Epic\u2019s lucrative virtual swag shop.\nIn its heyday, Fortnite was about as ubiquitous and popular as a game can be. Streaming gameplay routinely drew hundreds of thousands of viewers on Twitch, where a cottage industry of pro Fortnite players emerged, all laser-focused on Epic\u2019s polished battle royale. Epic keeps its metrics under wraps, but back in 2020 the game had more registered players than the population of the United States.\nEpic\u2019s hit game has both imported and exported popular culture since its launch in 2017. Like other live service online games, Fortnite releases new content every three-ish months, refreshing the destinations scattered across its cartoony island locale, changing the rules of physics and generally adding additional mayhem, often in the form of weapons.\nThose seasons are punctuated by flashy concerts and pop culture tie-ins, like a psychedelic Ariana Grande show, an in-game lightsaber fight with Darth Vader or the appearance of Dragon Ball Z\u2019s Goku as an in-game skin. The massive online shop for skins and other character customizations betrays Epic\u2019s loftier aspirations of building an interconnected virtual online world \u2014 a kind of metaverse, if you will.\nIn Fortnite, the map is everything. A bad map can ruin a chapter and players often wax nostalgic about in-game locales \u2014 usually alliterative hotspots with names like Tilted Towers or Loot Lake. Without a clear glimpse into what Fortnite\u2019s player base looks like these days, it\u2019s tough to know why Epic would decide to go retro and bring the game back to an older save state.\nIn 2023, Fortnite is far from dead. The game is still very popular, even if it\u2019s not clear exactly how popular. But if Fortnite was once lightning in a bottle, between other free-to-play rivals like Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone and others, that bottle is a lot more crowded these days.\nNostalgia sells in 2023\nEpic\u2019s decision to turn back the clock might seem small to anyone who hasn\u2019t dropped in off the Battle Bus, but it\u2019s an interesting reflection of the state of gaming right now. Games \u2014 and gamers\u2019 tastes \u2014 are increasingly following the wider entertainment trend of digging up familiar stories and repackaging them.\nGame developers seemed to believe for a time that cutting-edge graphics and hyper-realism were what consumers really wanted, but gamers\u2019 appetites have trended toward retro visuals, nostalgia and familiar game worlds more and more. That lower bar for visual fidelity also opens the doors for inventive indie games that don\u2019t rely on big budgets to shine, but the world\u2019s biggest game developers are riding the wave too.\nThis year\u2019s hit new Zelda game Tears of the Kingdom literally built a new game on top of the old one and remains a strong contender for Game of the Year. Competition is stiff though, more so now that Nintendo just casually dropped Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the first two-dimensional side-scrolling Mario game in more than a decade \u2014 another portal to the past given its departure from a long string of recent 3D Super Mario titles.\nSquare Enix was so confident in its remake of the 1997 Japanese roleplaying mega-hit Final Fantasy VII that the reimagined version of the game comprises three standalone full-length games, each spaced a few years apart.\nWorld of Warcraft paved the way\nFortnite\u2019s experiment to bring players back into the fold by relaunching an original version of the game will be interesting to watch, but it isn\u2019t a first. World of Warcraft, the fantasy roleplaying game once synonymous with online gaming, did something similar just a few years ago. Blizzard Entertainment, which developed the massively multiplayer online game (MMO), launched World of Warcraft Classic back in 2019, even as a modern version of the game remained online and playable.\nElizabeth Harper, editorial director of the longtime dedicated World of Warcraft news site Blizzard Watch, told TechCrunch that Blizzard actually reluctantly launched the old-school version of its game in response to demands from its own community.\n\u201cBefore WoW Classic originally launched, third parties were already running their own versions of \u2018classic\u2019 servers,\u201d Harper said. \u201cGame mechanics and class balance were extremely different then, and there was a lot of nostalgia for the community that existed back in the day.\u201d\nWhile Fortnite players, like WoW players, have a ton of nostalgia for the older version of the game, its maps were comparably simple and difficult to traverse. For players accustomed to gaming\u2019s modern quality of life improvements, old games can feel sparse and clunky if not reimagined outright.\n\u201cWoW Classic has been a runaway success, and fans can\u2019t get enough of re-releases of classic content, devouring each expansion and raid tier as they\u2019re rolled out. However, the WoW Classic team\u2019s philosophy has evolved since it was released: [Blizzard] initially was very serious about releasing the game without any changes, but these days the team feels that some changes need to be made,\u201d Harper said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not an expert in Fortnite, but a smart game developer will pay close attention to the features that spark that nostalgic joy and keep those in the forefront, while considering retaining modern conveniences that players appreciate.\u201d\nEpic hasn\u2019t shown its full hand for the new-old version of its own game, but it does sound like some of Fortnite\u2019s quality of life improvements will be sticking around, including sprinting and \u201cmantling,\u201d a parkour-like move that lets players climb over obstacles. In recent years, Epic has sprinkled all sorts of zany mobility options onto its map, letting players fall through the sky, pilot biplanes or (our personal preference) roll in a giant hamster ball to get around faster.\n\u201cWith MMOs, it\u2019s easier than ever for gaming experiences to be lost completely to time. New versions overwrite old versions, making original games inaccessible,\u201d Harper said.\n\u201cWorld of Warcraft will be 19 years old in November, and practically every feature and zone the game launched with has been remade in the years since\u2026. It\u2019s a ship of Theseus.\u201d\nMuch like the revolutions of a giant oversized hamster hurtling down from Fortnite\u2019s rave cave, gaming\u2019s nostalgia cycles are speeding up, with relaunches and remakes coming on quick. World of Warcraft Classic recreated a 15-year-old version of the game, but Fortnite\u2019s own blast from the past seeks to capture the magic of a relatively very recently bygone era.\n\u201cNostalgia sells, but it only sells because there\u2019s demand. Gamers want to go back and revisit their favorite games as they originally were, and I think developers who re-release games are developers who pay attention to their communities,\u201d Harper said.\n\u201cSure, there\u2019s a cynical side to this: game companies are in it to make money. But if we didn\u2019t love these classic games, they wouldn\u2019t be nearly as popular as they are.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Taylor Hatmaker, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":549}
{"title":"VTubers have reached their inevitable conclusion","context":"## VTubers have reached their inevitable conclusion\n\nTwitch has always allowed for various forms of expression, so it was no surprise when VTubing found a home on the platform, quickly gaining popularity among English-speaking audiences in 2019. Since then, the novelty of avatar-based content may have worn off, but the format has stuck around. And VTubing agencies, which continue to introduce new talents and offer one of the more financially secure methods of pursuing this sort of content, are still holding on in an attempt to harness new talent.\nVTubing exploded onto the wider North American and European markets when Cover Corporation launched the English branch of Hololive Production in 2020. Hololive\u2019s English debut saw the introduction of long-standing talents in the English community, such as the extremely popular Gawr Gura (the most subscribed-to Hololive talent to date) and Ninomae Ina\u2019nis. Even high-profile content creators like Pokimane pivoted toward using digital avatars weeks after Hololive\u2019s first generation of English talents debuted. Brands, too: Remember the Tony the Tiger VTuber in August of 2022?\nMany creators that jumped on the trend have since stopped using their avatars, but at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a large increase in VTubers on Twitch and other streaming platforms, like YouTube, as models and equipment became more accessible to the general public. Twitch has since gone on to highlight a wide variety of VTubers through its VTuber Takeover promotion, which most recently ran in August. Twitch also reported that VTubing-related content on the platform shot up by some 350% between January and August 2022. Despite this, some have argued that the VTubing bubble has all but burst.\nPolygon is celebrating TwitchCon 2023 with a package of stories covering streaming trends and news from the show. Check it out!\n\u201cI do feel that VTubing has become less novel as the market has become more saturated,\u201d says a streamer with agency Nijisanji who is not approved to speak publicly. \u201cThere are obviously some ups and downs when it comes to working with an agency as well, which requires a lot of patience if I\u2019m honest. And there are some decisions that are made that sometimes don\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d\nAgencies for VTubers manage their talents, often assigning them a manager that helps organize interviews, collaborations, paid promotions, and ad content on streams. Sometimes they can be financial advisors, but that is not always the case, as money made through agencies may include subscription or merchandise sales.\nThe source at Nijisanji notes that all talents within the agency are under nondisclosure agreements, which prevents them from sharing information with their audiences that could compromise their identity, or even inform viewers on why they could be graduating \u2014 which is effectively retirement for VTubers.\n\u201cSeeing agencies like Hololive and Nijisanji shut down entire branches or graduate talents without any real kind of information is heartbreaking for just about everyone involved in the process,\u201d the source says.\nIn 2020, Hololive shuttered its Chinese division, graduating more than a handful of streamers. More recently, Nijisanji announced the abrupt graduation of one of its more prominent talents, Mysta Rias. He revealed that his choice to leave Nijisanji was due to burnout. And in August, the parent company of Hololive, Cover Corporation, announced that two talents would be graduating from its Holostars division barely a year after debuting. Statements from the graduating talents were not provided outside of an official announcement from Cover.\nIn some cases, VTubers are not given a choice and can be graduated prematurely, though the agency itself never specifies.\nIndependent VTuber NagamiMugi feels as though \u201ccorporate VTubing\u201d is still a viable avenue for those looking to make a career out of the medium that can support content creation full-time. \u201cI think VTubing content has become kind of stale,\u201d she says. She goes on to mention that a lot of VTubers tend to be boxed into specific kinds of content \u2014 playing Minecraft or popular FPS games like Valorant. \u201cIn order for VTubing to continue to grow, VTubers need to branch out and create more content in line with other influencers,\u201d she says.\n\u201cAgencies should allow for talents to experiment, so long as it isn\u2019t hurting anyone\u201d\nMugi says that if VTubers took cues from other content creators and explored options like lore analysis videos or short-form reviews, the scene wouldn\u2019t be as stagnant. And like other VTubers, Mugi has dreams of going corporate. Already relatively successful, having created her own storefront that hosts collaborations and merchandise featuring other VTubers and artists, she has auditioned for several major agencies. She says that one agency asked if she would close down her business if she passed the interview phase and became one of its talents.\nThis isn\u2019t entirely uncommon, as the source from Nijisanji mentions that some talents have been given strict restrictions as to what content they can and can\u2019t create once their contracts with the agency expire. However, this can vary between talents and what is agreed upon between both the talent and the agency itself. So while agencies can be viable in terms of long-term growth for a creator, it is often strictly tied to the avatar associated with said agency. Both Hololive and Nijisanji give creators very little freedom in terms of presentation, whereas newer agencies such as Idol allow talents to create their own concepts. While that may feel overwhelming to some, it allows for the talents behind these models to flex their creativity and create a persona that otherwise wouldn\u2019t fit neatly into the clearly defined boxes some agencies slot them into.\n\u201cAgencies should allow for talents to experiment, so long as it isn\u2019t hurting anyone,\u201d says the source. \u201cLet people fail and still have that opportunity for growth in the future. More risk-taking and trying to branch out in other ways instead of simply just streaming or following preestablished methods.\u201d\nAccording to both of the people we interviewed for this story, this is an agreed-upon sentiment \u2014 that to prevent further stagnation, this not-so-niche form of content creation needs to reinvent itself and allow more freedom to its talents. Time will tell if larger agencies like Hololive (which reported 50% growth in its 2023 financial report) and Nijisanji will allow their talents to break the mold.\n\nThis article, authored by Kazuma Hashimoto, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-19 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":550}
{"title":"TwitchCon 2023 was better than last year, but everyone hated Las Vegas","context":"## TwitchCon 2023 was better than last year, but everyone hated Las Vegas\n\nTwitchCon 2023 was better than last year, but everyone hated Las Vegas TwitchCon felt positive for the first time in a while, one streamer said, but 'we are positive we don't want TwitchCon to be in Vegas again.'\nCompared to the shitshow that went down last year, TwitchCon Las Vegas was largely a success. The problem? Nobody liked Las Vegas.\nThis year\u2019s TwitchCon appeared to mitigate last year\u2019s crowding issues and concluded without any foam pit tragedies. The fraught relationship between Twitch and its streamers is on the mend after the company opened the event by announcing that it now allows simulcasting, so that streamers can stream on multiple other platforms at the same time. Attendees gushed about the overall positive energy at the convention, posting that it \u201cactually feels like Twitch is back.\u201d Livestreaming competitor Kick \u201chaunted\u201d TwitchCon with its nearby gaming lounge, but that didn\u2019t put a damper on TwitchCon\u2019s good vibes. There was even a gay engagement onstage!\nI can\u2019t believe I pulled this off \ud83d\ude06 what an amazing moment I will remember forever. Thank you Twitch \ud83d\udc9c https:\/\/t.co\/Jx0k0Q2OsZ \u2014 Lowco @ TwitchCon (@LowcoTV) October 20, 2023\nThe generally positive consensus comes after a tense year for Twitch, punctuated by rounds of layoffs and unpopular policy changes. Dan Clancy, who had served as the company\u2019s president since 2019, took the reins from Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear earlier this year, ending Shear\u2019s 16-year tenure as CEO. Clancy\u2019s leadership was initially met with trepidation; after meeting him at TwitchCon last year, streamer Jakenbake described him as \u201cout of touch with what streamers need and want.\u201d\nClancy appears to have made it up to the streamer community in time for this year\u2019s event. Lowco, the streamer who proposed to her girlfriend onstage during TwitchCon\u2019s opening ceremony, praised Twitch for improving its communication and transparency, and told TechCrunch that Clancy engaged with streamers all weekend. To run Twitch, she said, \u201cyou really need to understand the culture.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reigniting feeling that we as creators are being heard and can be a part of Twitch\u2019s decision making process,\u201d Lowco told TechCrunch. \u201cDan Clancy\u2019s presence this year made a tremendous impact on the atmosphere. He was everywhere, taking pictures, listening to creators, IRL streaming and truly being part of the TwitchCon experience.\u201d\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be TwitchCon without some grumbling. Though attendees said Twitch itself had improved, many expressed frustration about the event\u2019s location. The convention took place on the Las Vegas Strip, an area that\u2019s expensive, not walkable and lacks spaces to casually hang out with other streamers.\n\u201cI think most of us agree TwitchCon Vegas felt very positive in a way that hasn\u2019t been felt in some time,\u201d Lowco posted on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cBut also we are positive we don\u2019t want TwitchCon to be in Vegas again. Lol.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the first North American TwitchCon to be held outside of California since Twitch\u2019s inaugural convention in 2015. Las Vegas may be able to physically accommodate such a large event, but many TwitchCon attendees complain that it lacks the infrastructure to foster the community engagement that Twitch revolves around. Daytime hangouts outside of the convention center were challenging; spaces that don\u2019t revolve around drinking or gambling are scarce on the Strip, and if they do exist, they\u2019re too far from the convention center to quickly visit.\n\u201cThe convention center in Vegas was solid but the city had way too much going on,\u201d Lowco added. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the distractions of Vegas, there\u2019s enough for us to do. Vegas had the community split all over the city, which is not convenient to get around.\u201d\nHonestly yeah. The psotive vibes were absolutely amazing but PLEASE NOT VEGAS AGAIN.\nSEATLE. NATIONAL HARBOR. ANYTHING BUT VEGAS https:\/\/t.co\/G3eYWwFme5 \u2014 Redclaw\ud83e\udd96\ud83d\udd1eDinoVtuber (@RedclawDraws) October 24, 2023\nRachel Delphin, chief marketing officer at Twitch, confirmed to TechCrunch that next year\u2019s convention will not be in Las Vegas, but couldn\u2019t disclose where it would wind up. Twitch hosts two conventions every year: one in Europe and one in North America. TwitchCon Europe has taken place in Berlin, Amsterdam and, most recently, Paris. Twitch has hosted its North American events throughout California, including in San Jose, Long Beach and San Diego.\nTo its credit, Twitch is receptive to community feedback, and has had to dramatically scale up its conventions as the platform\u2019s usership skyrocketed since the pandemic started in 2020. Attendees complained that last year\u2019s event, which was the first convention that Twitch hosted in North America in nearly three years, was overcrowded and poorly laid out. The San Diego Convention Center\u2019s tight hallways couldn\u2019t accommodate so many people, which was worsened by fans flocking around popular streamers and blocking the flow of traffic.\nAttendees also complained that the venue was inaccessible for those using mobility aids, such as wheelchairs and walkers, because of the unmanaged crowds and unprepared security. In an X thread about the event\u2019s lack of accessibility, attendees said that when popular streamers walked by, swarming fans pushed around those using mobility aids and nearly trampled them.\nTwitch managed to mitigate crowding issues during this year\u2019s convention, a success that Delphin credits to the company learning quickly.\n\u201cIt was a huge demand to come back. I think fandoms have grown in that time period, just the fervor around specific creators that was totally and wholly different than we\u2019d seen before,\u201d Delphin said of last year\u2019s TwitchCon. \u201cAnd the creators themselves had also absolutely exploded. It used to be that you\u2019d come to TwitchCon, be the biggest creator, and you could walk around pretty freely. Now it\u2019s huge, it\u2019s a whole different kind of apparatus to manage.\u201d\nAttendee feedback is clear: Next year\u2019s convention, wherever it is, needs to have more accessible third places.\nThe third place is a sociological term that refers to a physical space that isn\u2019t work or home, where people can socialize without the obligations of productivity. If you can hang out there, it\u2019s a third place. During the pandemic, virtual communities served as ad hoc third places in lieu of coffee shops, bookstores and gyms. Twitch, which saw exponential growth during the pandemic, was one of them. Last year\u2019s San Diego-based TwitchCon, for all of its faults, took place in a walkable city abundant with nearby places to hang out, allowing attendees to bond, network and interact outside of the convention center. There\u2019s no shortage of third places in Las Vegas, but for many TwitchCon attendees, nightclubs and casinos aren\u2019t accessible alternatives to San Diego\u2019s more casual venues.\nMoni, a streamer working in games tech who goes by Monistreams, expressed her frustrations in a recent post on Twitch\u2019s feedback forum UserVoice.\n\u201cThey do a really good job of preparing content, it truly feels like a celebration of the community and streamers,\u201d Moni said over a Discord call. \u201cThat\u2019s their selling point. It is a celebration of streamers and their communities. However, in Las Vegas, it felt like people were not spending time with their favorite streamers or their communities because they were all stuck in an Uber or walking an hour on the Strip, or basically doing anything else but being at the con.\u201d\nFor a city designed around tourism, the Las Vegas Strip is a pain to navigate \u2014 a fact that CES attendees are well acquainted with. Whatever traffic and accessibility issues last year\u2019s TwitchCon attendees faced in San Diego\u2019s Gaslamp Quarter paled in comparison to the complaints about the Las Vegas Strip.\nWalking in the sprawl of casinos is nearly impossible, especially in Nevada\u2019s oppressive October heat. The Las Vegas Convention Center, where TwitchCon\u2019s programming and exposition hall were based, is located at the end of the Strip and the majority of nearby dining options are either fast food chains or extravagant restaurants. Taking rideshares could be prohibitively expensive (I, for example, spent a heinous $37 on one 10-minute ride between TwitchCon events), and the sheer demand for cars meant that waiting for an Uber could take anywhere between five and 30 minutes. Other events nearby, like the emo revival music festival When We Were Young and the upcoming Formula One Grand Prix, further complicated travel around the convention center.\nIt was even worse for disabled attendees. Streamer Steve Saylor, a blind gamer and disability advocate, posted that he struggled to get around Las Vegas, even with rideshares, and that those with motor disabilities had even more difficulties because of the lack of adequate accommodations in the city\u2019s infrastructure.\nFinally back from #TwitchCon and it was such a cool vibe that I really enjoyed everything about it. The people there were amazing! Vegas tho, just the absolute worst. Especially for those with disabilities trying to get anywhere. I hope I never have to go back there again. \u2014 Steve Saylor (@stevesaylor) October 24, 2023\nThese complaints about the Las Vegas Strip aren\u2019t new, and are usually accepted in the trade-off for a weekend of partying or networking at a business conference. Twitch\u2019s usership, however, skews younger \u2014 Twitch reports that in 2022, over 70% of its viewers were between 18 and 34 \u2014 and they may not have the disposable income to drop hundreds every day on meals and rides. Attendees who do drink complained that Las Vegas is significantly more expensive than San Diego.\nThe city\u2019s emphasis on drinking and gambling is incompatible with much of Twitch\u2019s usership. Las Vegas venues are overwhelmingly 21+, which excludes a significant portion of TwitchCon\u2019s streamers and viewers. Even if they are of legal drinking age, today\u2019s young adults tend to drink less than previous generations did.\nLas Vegas\u2019 frenetic pacing is enthralling for many, but some Twitch users complained that the city\u2019s energy didn\u2019t fit the Twitch demographic. Moni\u2019s UserVoice post noted that the sensory overload that makes Las Vegas feel like Las Vegas isn\u2019t as alluring for introverted gamers.\n\u201cI want to be mindful of the target audience Twitch serves \u2014 I would probably assume many of us felt the same about the overstimulation,\u201d Twitch streamer herokerrey commented. \u201cWhile I understand in-person events are a hype\/stimulating experience, pairing it with one of the most active cities in the world may not have been the best pick.\u201d\nOther users commented that they missed the spontaneous get-togethers that made previous conventions so enjoyable, and that the offsite events like creator mixers were scattered across the city. One commenter complained that transportation between events took as long as actually attending the events.\nDinomiteTwins, Twitch streamers who are identical twins and share a channel, commented that the city\u2019s size \u201cput a damper\u201d on how easily they could meet fellow creators.\n\u201cWe were in an approved hotel [provided by Twitch] and I met more vacationers, metal workers and brides than Twitch streamers in my hotel,\u201d one of the DinomiteTwins commented. \u201cA smaller walkable city promotes organic interaction as we are not all taking cabs \u2026 It felt like the priority was just being in a fun place instead of facilitating vendor, creator and community meetups and deepening those ties.\u201d\nThird places provide more than just a break from the glare of fluorescent convention center lighting \u2014 they\u2019re vital for building community, a sentiment that Twitch insists is unique to its platform as other livestreaming competitors gain users. Compared to its competitors, Twitch\u2019s robust moderation and slew of collaboration features does facilitate a closer knit sense of community among its streamers and viewers. There was plenty of opportunity to mingle within the walls of the convention center, which even had a designated room to decompress and make friendship bracelets, but organic interactions seemed constrained to Twitch-sponsored events. The diverse programming and various meetups could only do so much in an area with so few casual social spaces.\nLowco, Moni and multiple other Twitch users commenting on Moni\u2019s UserVoice post all questioned why TwitchCon couldn\u2019t take place in San Diego again. Some have floated hosting both a West Coast and East Coast TwitchCon, if capacity is a concern. VidCon, which has traditionally been held in Anaheim, California, recently launched a second convention earlier this year in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\u201cUltimately, TwitchCon is a community celebration,\u201d Lowco said. \u201cWe are there to meet up with our viewers and fellow streamers. Let\u2019s pick places that make it easy for us to gather.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Morgan Sung, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-26 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":551}
{"title":"Fantasy Football TE PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at tight end","context":"## Fantasy Football TE PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at tight end\n\nThis week might not matter for many fantasy football owners. Some have secured their spot in the postseason; others are well out of contention. However, for those in must-win situations, this week really matters. It's not the time to have a hole in your lineup at tight end, but if you do, we're here to help with our Week 14 fantasy TE PPR rankings.\nFortunately, there are several solid sleepers and streaming options despite two tough byes and some big injuries to notable TEs. It's always tough to know who to trust at this volatile position, so we break down which tight ends have higher floors for those favored to win comfortably and which have higher ceilings for those who need to really shoot for big points.\nLet's get to it and check out the TE landscape for Week 14.\nWho are the TEs on bye in Week 14?\nFew would've expected Week 14's two-team bye to be as problematic as it is, but losing Logan Thomas and Trey McBride this late in the season could have some fantasy owners scrambling.\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | D\/STs | Kickers\nFortunately, both the Commanders and Cardinals have above-average TE defenses, so taking those off the board only helps the position this week.\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWho are the best fantasy TEs in Week 14?\nAs usual, Travis Kelce (vs. Bills in Week 14) tops our rankings, but T.J. Hockenson (@ Raiders), Sam LaPorta (@ Bears), David Njoku (vs. Jaguars), and Dalton Kincaid (@ Chiefs) aren't far behind. LaPorta and Njoku both have great matchups against defenses that entered last week in the top 10 in fantasy points per game (FPPG) allowed to TEs, and we know what Kelce, Hockenson, and Kincaid do every week in PPR formats.\nGeorge Kittle (vs. Seahawks) doesn't have a great matchup -- especially when you remember that he had just three catches for 19 yards against Seattle in Week 12 -- but he remains a must-start given his high ceiling in any matchup.\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nWho are the best fantasy TE sleepers, pickups, & streamers in Week 14?\nIt can be tough to trust Taysom Hill (vs. Panthers) in full-point PPR leagues, but a matchup against the league's second-worst run defense gives him a high ceiling regardless of format. He's been more involved as a receiver this year, so he'll get a few catches to go along with the rushing stats, too. With Derek Carr (concussion) banged up, Hill might throw more this week, too.\nGerald Everett (vs. Broncos) and Isaiah Likely (vs. Rams) have matchups against bottom-six TE defenses, and Cole Kmet (vs. Lions), Jake Ferguson (vs. Eagles), and Kyle Pitts (vs. Buccaneers) also have above-average matchups that give them higher floors and higher ceilings than usual.\nFor those in deeper leagues, Tyler Conklin (vs. Texans), and Cade Otton (@ Falcons) both have matchups against defenses that entered last week in the top five for FPPG allowed to TEs. Brevin Jordan (@ Jets) and Tanner Hudson (vs. Colts) also have highly favorable matchups and can work as deep-league PPR plays, though Jordan's outlook is entirely dependent on whether Dalton Schultz (hamstring) is healthy.\nWEEK 14 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nWho are the biggest potential fantasy TE busts in Week 14?\nDallas Goedert (@ Cowboys) isn't a \"must-start\" if he returns from his forearm injury this week. That said, he's also not a \"must-sit.\" He had three catches and 50 yards against Dallas in Week 9 before exiting early with the forearm injury, so he can clearly produce against this defense. Still, it's smart to check your other options before trusting Goedert.\nThe same goes for Evan Engram (@ Browns). He's generally more reliable in PPR leagues, but he's facing a Browns' defense that allows the fewest FPPG to TEs. Both Engram and Pat Freiermuth (vs. Patriots) are in tough spots against top-five TE defenses.\nWhat are the biggest TE injuries in Week 14?\nWe already mentioned Goedert (forearm) and Schultz (hamstring), but another TE who could be back this week is Darren Waller (hamstring). The Giants really have no reason to bring back their star TE if they don't feel like he's 100 percent, but it's something to monitor throughout the week, as Waller (vs. Packers) always has a high ceiling as the Giants' de facto No. 1 receiver.\nTyler Higbee (neck) was banged up last week, and he's no sure thing to suit up this week against Baltimore. Even if he does, he's not a recommended play against the Ravens' top-10 TE defense.\nWe'll be updating these TE PPR rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.\nFantasy TE PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, sit at tight end\nRankings based on full-point PPR formats\nRank Player\n1 Travis Kelce, Chiefs vs. Bills\n2 T.J.

{"title":"Fantasy Football QB Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at quarterback","context":"## Fantasy Football QB Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at quarterback\n\nAlas, we've reached the final week of the fantasy football regular season. Although fantasy's highest-scoring position has been beaten and battered this year, there are serviceable signal-callers out there capable of leading your team to victory in a pivotal week. Our Week 14 fantasy QB rankings will help you make the right start 'em, sit 'em moves to cap off the regular season.\nWe're still dealing with byes -- and we had two more QB injuries last week -- but the position remains deep with high-scoring studs and potential sleepers. As we saw last week, we're at the point in the season where weather could factor into start-sit decisions, but finding quarterback production shouldn't be a problem in 10- and 12-team leagues.\nWith that in mind, let's dissect this week's QB rankings and put you on a path to end your season with a \"W.\"\nWhich QBs are on bye in Week 14?\nCoinciding with the end of the fantasy regular season, Week 14 is the last week of byes, as the Cardinals and Commanders are the last two teams to take their mandatory PTO. That means two starting-caliber QBs (Kyler Murray and Sam Howell) are on the shelf, slightly impacting the QB pool.\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\nRBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nThe bigger losses, though, come on the defensive side of the ball, as fantasy owners won't be able to start QBs going up against two subpar pass defenses in Washington and Arizona. Starting any QB facing the Commanders' swiss-cheese defense has yielded strong returns. Arizona has been just as inefficient, entering Week 13 ranking 30th in dropback EPA.\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nRBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWho are the best fantasy QBs in Week 14?\nDespite Buffalo being on the outside looking in for a playoff berth, Josh Allen (@ Chiefs in Week 14) has come through in fantasy, sitting as our QB1 for Week 14. Yes, the Chiefs' defense has done its part in keeping QBs in check this season, entering Week 13 allowing the fifth-fewest fantasy points per game (FPPG) to the position, but Allen has performed well against Steve Spagnuolo's defense in the past. He's averaging 276.4 passing yards per game with a strong 14:2 TD-to-INT ratio over five career games against KC.\nNot far behind sits Tua Tagovailoa (vs. Titans), who shredded the Commanders' defense to the tune of 280 yards and two TDs in Sunday's blowout. Another juicy matchup awaits against a lackluster Tennessee coverage unit. Dak Prescott (vs. Eagles) remains a top-three play in Sunday's rematch versus the Eagles, a team he torched for 374 yards and three TDs in a narrow 28-23 loss in Week 9.\nJalen Hurts (@ Cowboys) and the Eagles look to get back on track in a pivotal NFC East clash in Dallas, facing a Cowboys defense that let Geno Smith post top-end QB1 numbers against them last week. Patrick Mahomes (vs. Bills) is in line to put up strong numbers in a potential shootout against Buffalo, and although his receiving corps has its issues, the reigning MVP is still a top-five play this week.\nLamar Jackson (vs. Rams) faces an exploitable L.A. secondary, while Jared Goff (@ Bears) looks to build off a dominant Week 13 effort against an ascending Chicago stop unit. C.J. Stroud (@ Jets) sees a slight dip in his Week 14 ranking in a tough road test against the Jets, but the Rookie of the Year frontrunner still profiles as a set-it-and-forget-it QB1.\nWho are the best fantasy QB sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 14?\nWeek 14 is a challenging one from streaming perspective, as Gardner Minshew (@ Bengals), Jameis Winston (vs. Panthers), Baker Mayfield (@ Falcons), and Joe Flacco (@ Jaguars) look like the best options.\nMinshew is executing Shane Steichen's scheme at an efficient clip and now faces a Cincinnati stop unit that ranks below the league average in dropback EPA. Assuming Winston gets the starting nod in place of the banged-up Derek Carr (head, shoulder, back), his gunslinger play style could lead to a respectable fantasy output against the reeling Panthers.\nMayfield wasn't asked to do much with his arm in Week 13, but a potential negative game script in Atlanta could force him to air the ball out at a higher clip, boosting his fantasy prospects. Although the Browns didn't get the win in Flacco's first start with his new team, the veteran did everything he could to keep Cleveland within striking distance, racking up 254 yards and two TDs. Another 250-plus yard, multi-TD effort could again be in store if he continues to start in place of Dorian Thompson-Robinson (concussion).\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nWho are the biggest potential QB busts in Week 14?\nMatthew Stafford (@ Ravens), Geno Smith (@ 49ers), and Josh Dobbs (@ Raiders) are all risky against some of the league's better pass defenses. Stafford faces a sound Ravens stop unit that entered their Week 13 bye allowing the second-fewest FPPG to QBs.\nThere's a chance the Vikings opt to start fellow QB Nick Mullens over Dobbs after his debacle last Monday night against the Bears, but if Minnesota elects to stick with Dobbs, his rocky Week 12 outing concerns us against a Raiders defense that's been one of the more efficient pass defenses since Week 5, sitting eighth in dropback EPA.\nOn the other hand, after an elite Week 13 effort in Seattle's one-possession loss to Dallas, fantasy owners might go looking to chase points with Smith, but replicating last week's showing against the 49ers is a completely different ask for a QB who's underwhelmed this season.\nWEEK 14 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nWhat are the biggest QB injuries in Week 14?\nLeading into Week 13, Dorian Thompson-Robinson (concussion) was the lone QB injury situation we were closely monitoring. Even if Thompson-Robinson is able to clear concussion protocol in time for Week 14, we expect Flacco to make his second start as a Brown.\nThis week, we unfortunately saw Kenny Pickett (ankle) and Derek Carr (head, shoulder, back) exit their respective contests with injuries, complicating their statuses for Week 14. We've replaced both QBs with backups Mitchell Trubisky and Jameis Winston, respectively, as early indications point toward both missing time.\nUPDATE: Trevor Lawrence suffered an ankle injury on Monday, which will likely keep him out for at least a week and open the door for C.J.

{"title":"Totals Betting - What is an Over\/Under Bet?","context":"## Totals Betting - What is an Over\/Under Bet?\n\nIn sports betting, betting on totals is a favorite option alongside point spreads and moneylines.\nRather than pick the winner or the winning margin, with totals betting (a.k.a. over\/unders), you predict the game\u2019s combined score.\nIn the sections below, we'll explain totals betting completely incluidng its main attributes, over\/under examples from multiple sports, and some totals betting pointers for both novice and seasoned bettors.\nWhat is an over\/under bet?\nA totals bet, commonly known as an over\/under bet, involves betting on the combined score of both teams in a game.\nBookmakers set a predicted total score for the game, and bettors choose whether they think the actual combined score will surpass (over) or fall short of (under) that number.\nFor instance, if an NBA betting site sets the total for a basketball game at 210.5 points, those who bet the \"over\" would win if the combined score of the two teams is 211 or more.\nThose who bet the \"under\" would win if the score totals 210 or less. The 0.5 ensures no chance of a tie, as teams can't score in half-points.\nYour only concern is whether the final combined score will fall over or under the line set by oddsmakers.\nHow do over\/under odds work?\nWhen placing totals wagers, you\u2019ll see odds listed alongside the over\/under number. These odds indicate the potential payout for the bet.\nTypically, the odds for totals bets are close to even, ranging from -105 to -120.\nThis narrow range reflects the bookmakers' belief that the event has a roughly even chance of going either way, with neither the over nor the under being heavily favored.\nDoes the totals line move or change?\nYes, the totals line can move. The line movement occurs in response to various factors:\nBetting Activity: One of the most common reasons for line movement is a significant amount of money being wagered on one side (either over or under). Bookmakers adjust the line to balance the action and protect themselves from potential losses.\nOne of the most common reasons for line movement is a significant amount of money being wagered on one side (either over or under).

Weather Conditions: In outdoor sports, weather can play a significant role. For example, heavy rain or snow in a football game might lead to expectations of a lower-scoring game, causing the line to move down.\nIn outdoor sports, weather can play a significant role. For example, heavy rain or snow in a football game might lead to expectations of a lower-scoring game, causing the line to move down. Other News and Updates: Any news that might affect the performance of the teams, such as changes in team strategy or recent performances, can influence totals lines.\nTotals betting outcomes\nWhen placing an over\/under wager, there are a few potential outcomes to consider. If the combined score exceeds the set total, the \"over\" bet wins.\nConversely, if the score is below the set total, the \"under\" bet wins. If the combined score of the game matches the total, the bet is typically considered a \"push,\" and the wager is refunded.\nNow, let\u2019s break down those three scenarios.\nTotals win\nImagine the NBA over\/under odds for a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics is 220.5 points. If a bettor believes that the game will be high-scoring and that the teams' combined score will exceed this mark, they might place an \"over\" bet.\nThe game then unfolds, and the Lakers score 115 points while the Celtics score 110, resulting in a combined score of 225 points. Since 225 exceeds the set total of 220.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"over\" wins their bet.\nTotals loss\nSuppose a top sports betting app sets a total of 200.5 points for an NBA game between the New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls.\nIf a bettor believes the game will be defensive and low-scoring, they might place an \"under\" bet, predicting that the combined score of both teams will be 200 points or less.\nHowever, if the game turns out to be offensively charged and the Knicks score 105 points while the Bulls score 100 points, the combined score becomes 205 points. Since 205 exceeds the set total of 200.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"under\" loses their bet.\nPush\nA push occurs when the combined score of a game matches the set total established by the bookmaker, meaning that bettors neither win nor lose, and their original wager is refunded. However, to avoid this outcome, most sportsbooks employ half-points in their totals.\nBy using half points, such as setting a total at 200.5 instead of 200, the sports betting sites ensure that a game's combined score cannot possibly match the set total exactly.\nTotals betting by sport\nOver\/under betting is a major draw across many popular sports. Let\u2019s break down how it can look across sports.\nOver\/under odds in football\nLet's consider some NFL over\/under odds between the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles.\nThe bookmaker sets the over\/under total at 47.5 points for the combined score of both teams. A bettor believes it will be a high-scoring game and places an \"over\" bet.\nThe game concludes with the Cowboys scoring 28 points and the Eagles scoring 24 points, leading to a combined score of 52 points. Since 52 exceeds the set total of 47.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"over\" wins their bet.\nOver\/under odds in basketball\nImagine NBA over\/under odds between the Charlotte Hornets and the Houston Rockets. The bookmaker sets the over\/under total at 215.5 points for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, expecting a defensive showdown, places an \"under\" bet.\nThe game ends with the Hornets scoring 105 points and the Rockets scoring 108 points, yielding a combined score of 213 points. Since 213 is below the set total of 215.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"under\" successfully wins their bet.\nOver\/under odds in baseball\nLet's look at MLB over\/under odds between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. The bookmaker establishes the over\/under total at 8.5 runs for the combined score of both teams.\nA bettor, thinking it'll be an offensively charged game with both teams having their best hitters in the lineup, places an \"over\" bet. The game wraps up with the Yankees scoring 5 runs and the Red Sox tallying up 6 runs, resulting in a combined score of 11 runs.\nSince 11 exceeds the set total of 8.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"over\" comes out on top.\nOver\/under odds in hockey\nLet's consider NHL over\/under odds between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens.\nThe bookmaker sets the over\/under total at 5.5 goals for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, anticipating a game dominated by goalkeepers and defense, places an \"under\" bet.\nThe game ends with the Maple Leafs netting 3 goals and the Canadiens scoring 2, leading to a combined score of 5 goals. Since 5 is below the set total of 5.5, the bettor who opted for the \"under\" secures a win on their wager.\nOver\/under odds in soccer\nLet's take some Premier League soccer odds between Manchester United and Chelsea. The bookmaker determines the over\/under total at 2.5 goals for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, feeling that both teams have been on a scoring spree lately, places an \"over\" bet.\nThe match ends with Manchester United scoring 2 goals and Chelsea netting 2 as well, resulting in a combined score of 4 goals. Since 4 surpasses the set total of 2.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"over\" enjoys a winning bet.\nOver\/under odds in MMA\nIn an MMA context, over\/under bets often refer to the duration of the fight rather than points or scores. Let's consider a UFC bout between Fighter A and Fighter B. The bookmaker sets an over\/under line at 2.5 rounds for the fight's duration.\nA bettor, believing that both fighters have aggressive styles and the fight will conclude early, places an \"under\" bet. If the fight ends midway through the second round due to a knockout or submission, the total rounds would be 1.5.\nSince this is below the set total of 2.5 rounds, the bettor who wagered on the \"under\" wins their bet. Conversely, if the fight extends beyond the midway point of the third round, \"over\" bets would win.\nSee more: Best MMA betting sites\nOver\/under odds in tennis\nAt tennis betting sites, over\/under betting typically revolves around the total number of games or sets played in a match. Let's consider a Grand Slam match between Player A and Player B. The bookmaker sets the over\/under total at 40.5 games for the entire match.\nA bettor, anticipating a closely contested match with many extended sets, places an \"over\" bet. The match unfolds with the following set scores: 7-5, 6-7, 7-6, and 6-4. The combined total number of games played is 42. Since 42 exceeds the set total of 40.5, the bettor who wagered on the \"over\" wins their bet.\nOver\/under odds in golf\nAt golf betting sites, over\/under betting often pertains to a golfer's score for a specific round or the entire tournament relative to par. Let's consider a major tournament where a notable golfer, say Rory McIlroy, is playing. The bookmaker sets an over\/under line at 69.5 strokes for his first-round score.\nA bettor, analyzing the challenging course conditions and believing McIlroy might face difficulties, places an \"under\" bet, predicting he'll finish the round in 69 strokes or fewer.\nIf McIlroy concludes the round with a score of 68, which is 3 under par on a par-71 course, the bettor's \"under\" wager wins. Conversely, if McIlroy shoots a 70 or higher, those who bet the \"over\" would win.\nTotals betting FAQ\nHow do over\/under bets work?\nOver\/under bets, also known as totals bets, involve wagering on whether a particular number (like combined points scored in a game, total rounds in a fight, or total games in a tennis match) will be over or under the figure set by the bookmaker.\nDoes overtime count in totals wagering?\nYes, in most sports and with the majority of sportsbooks, overtime does count toward your totals wager. Always check the specific rules of the sportsbook you are betting with to confirm, but generally, overtime is included in totals wagers.\nWhy does the over\/under betting line change?\nSportsbooks set game totals considering factors like recent performances, weather, and player status. As new data emerges and betting trends develop, this line can shift.\nFor instance, if many bettors choose the \"over,\" the sportsbook might raise the total to balance the bets. Line movements often reflect public betting sentiments and offer insights to informed bettors. Therefore, bettors must monitor any line changes before the game starts and strategize accordingly to optimize their betting success.\nIs it better to bet over or under?\nNeither wager holds a universal advantage. Success in over\/under betting hinges on a thorough evaluation of both the set line and the competing teams.\nHow do you read an over\/under bet?\nReading a total bet involves understanding the combined score set by the sportsbook and the odds associated with that number. When you see a total, such as 210.5 in a basketball game, it represents the combined score anticipated from both teams. Beside this number, you'll typically find \"over\" and \"under\" options.\nIf you believe the actual combined score will surpass this number, you'd bet on the \"over.\" Conversely, if you think it will be less, you'd choose the \"under.\" Accompanying these options are odds that indicate the payout for the bet.\nFor instance, odds of -110 (extremely common) mean you'd need to wager $110 to win an additional $100. Evaluating both the total and the associated odds is crucial for informed betting decisions.\nRelated Pages:\n\nThis article, authored by Sam Eggleston, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":554}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nOne of the world\u2019s most spectacular natural phenomena, at certain periods during the year the Northern Lights regularly light up the skies of northern countries that sit in the \u2018aurora zone\u2019 of the Arctic Circle.\nThe light show happens when electronically charged particles enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere from space, producing dazzling displays of green, yellow, purple and even red lights.\nThis is visible every year in some areas of European countries like Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Norway, while there are regular sightings in parts of Canada and Greenland too. Fortunately for Brits, you don\u2019t necessarily need to trek to these countries to see the aurora borealis; sightings have become more frequent in the UK, with the lights seen as far south as Wiltshire in February 2023.\nAlthough numerous UK locations have reported sightings in recent years, these do tend to be in northern areas of the British Isles. It\u2019s tough to predict exactly when and where the spectacle will make an appearance, but we\u2019ve rounded up a list of the best places where you might be lucky enough to see the Northern Lights in the UK.\nHebrides, Scotland\nThe Lights above Skye in the Inner Hebrides (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nThis northern archipelago off the western Scottish coast comprises hundreds of islands, split into the Inner and Outer Hebrides. While the Lights can be seen in Skye and other isles of the Inner Hebrides, your best bet for seeing the lights remains in the Outer Hebrides, likely on the islands of Lewis or Harris. The flat beaches and countryside are great viewing points, while the remote parts of the islands are subject to almost no light pollution. The exceptionally dark skies here are known to be good for star gazing; even if you miss the lights, there\u2019s every chance you\u2019ll see the Orion Nebula, the Milky Way and the Great Andromeda galaxy.\nThe \u2018season\u2019 here runs from September to April, though the aurora is most common in winter, when skies get dark in the late afternoon. In February, the Isle of Lewis hosts its own Dark Skies Festival, with events including live music, film and theatre.\nShetland Isles, Scotland\nThe Shetland Isles are a good Scottish destination for light spotting (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nThe most northerly point in all of Britain, Shetland lies closest to the North Pole and is a location where locals can expect to see the Northern Lights a few times every winter. Over 100 miles from the mainland, the remote isle is home to plenty of tranquil countryside and coastal scenery, providing dozens of spots where you can potentially watch the lights away from the light pollution of nearby settlements.\nThe season here runs from mid-October to mid-March, with winter again being the best time to try and see the phenomenon (there are less than six hours of daylight during the shortest days). Though light shows aren\u2019t guaranteed during your stay, wildlife spotting, walking and exploring the towns more than make up for any disappointment should the aurora fail to materialise.\nRead more on UK travel:\nCairngorms, Scotland\nThe Cairngorms are home to an area of International Dark Sky Park (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nThe UK\u2019s largest National Park is another Scottish destination for potentially seeing the Northern Lights. The park is home to Ben Nevis, the highest peak in the UK, and one of the UK\u2019s International Dark Sky Parks (areas noted for \u201cpossessing an exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights\u201d). This area is situated around the Glenlivet Estate, forming the Tomintoul and Glenlivet park. An area with \u201cremarkably dark skies\u201d, the region is busy all year thanks to its vast amount of wilderness to explore and wildlife to see.\nWhile mountains and hills may block views, there are plenty of dark areas that are perfect for seeing the lights between mid-October and mid-March (especially those nearer the coast, where views are less likely to be interrupted by clouds).\nYorkshire Dales, England\nThe lack of light pollution makes the Yorkshire Dales a great place to spot the aurora (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nWith a northerly, light-pollution free location as the gold standard for seeing the Northern Lights in the UK, the Yorkshire Dales are an oft-viable destination. The aurora was seen here as recently as April 2023; the park is one of England\u2019s Dark Sky Reserves and the largest in the UK, and will be hosting a joint Dark Skies Festival with the North York Moors National Park in February 2024. It has four Dark Sky Discovery sites (designated nationwide for \u201cgood sightlines of the sky\u201d and a lack of light pollution), which are in Buckden National Park Car Park, Tan Hill Inn and both Hawes and Malham National Park Visitor Centres.\nAccording to the park\u2019s website, on clear nights you can see as many as 2,000 stars, the Milky Way and even the International Space Station. The Perseid meteor shower occurs in August, though the best time to see the Lights is still between September and March \u2013 just remember to wrap up warm and follow any aurora updates online or on specially dedicated apps.\nNorthumberland, England\nThe Northern Lights over Bamburgh\u2019s lighthouse (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nAnother International Dark Sky Park, Northumberland\u2019s National Park reportedly boasts the darkest skies in the UK (so is also an excellent stargazing spot). Although it sits at a more southerly latitude than many other light-spotting locations, the aurora has been seen over Hadrian\u2019s Wall and Bamburgh in the past, and the county itself remains one of the most reliable locations to see the display in England. Lights are only usually visible here after particularly strong geomagnetic storms, so it may be an idea to keep track of these if planning a visit. Again, the areas near the coast \u2013 themselves in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty \u2013 can be better for seeing the aurora due to the presence of fewer clouds.\nSnowdonia, Wales\nA strong storm made the Lights visible in Snowdonia in this photo (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nOne of three Dark Sky reserves in Wales, Snowdonia also boasts the country\u2019s highest peak, largest lake, its own section of mountain railway and 1,497 miles of public footpaths. The 823-square mile park provides views of the Milky Way and major constellations on clear nights, with the odd shooting star to make up for those nights where you miss out on an aurora borealis show. As with most places in the UK, you\u2019re more likely to see the lights between October and March. For the best views, head to the lakes of Llyn Geirionydd and Llyn y Dywarchen or to Ty Cipar, between Llan Ffestiniog and Ysbyty Ifan.\nLake District, England\nThe clear skies over Buttermere in the Lake District (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nWhile better known as a destination for walking, hiking and simply enjoying the peace and tranquility of the surrounding nature, the Lake District is also one of the best places in England to see the Northern Lights. The area is an exceptional place for stargazing too and is currently seeking to become an International Dark Sky Reserve. Though the lights are rarer here than in Scotland, the lakeside backdrops make for particularly dramatic surroundings if the lights do appear, with excellent view points at Grizedale Forest, Wasdale, the Langdale Valley and Derwentwater.\nRead our reviews of the best UK hotels\n\nThis article, authored by Chris Wilson, was published by The Independent - Travel on 2023-12-21 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":555}
{"title":"See stunning images of STEVE and auroras from this weekend's powerful solar storm","context":"## See stunning images of STEVE and auroras from this weekend's powerful solar storm\n\nSkywatchers worldwide were treated to a magnificent aurora light show over the weekend as northern lights were reported as far south as Greece and Turkey.\nThe colorful aurora displays were triggered by a strong geomagnetic storm that peaked as a strong G3 on Nov. 5 at 12:40 p.m. EST (1740 GMT) on the 5-grade scale used by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to assess the severity of space weather events.\nGeomagnetic storms are disturbances to Earth's magnetic field caused by solar material from coronal mass ejections (CME) \u2014 large expulsions of plasma and magnetic fields from the sun's atmosphere. This particular geomagnetic storm was triggered by not one but two CMEs that slammed into Earth on Nov 4 and Nov. 5, according to spaceweather.com.\nDuring a solar storm, energized particles from the sun slam into Earth's atmosphere at speeds of up to 45 million mph (72 million km\/h) and our planet's magnetic field funnels the particles toward the poles. The supercharging of molecules in Earth's atmosphere triggers the colorful spectacles, which usually remain limited to areas at high latitudes for the aurora borealis (northern lights) and the aurora australis (southern lights).\nBelow, we take a look at some of the best aurora photos captured by skywatchers around the world.\nDebby Thorne captured this beautiful display from Cullen on the Moray Firth in Scotland with an iPhone 14 Pro in night mode on Nov. 5.\nVibrant pink aurora display from Cullen on the Moray Firth in Scotland looking towards Bow Fiddle Rock.

{"title":"Shop 200+ Walmart doorbuster deals for Black Friday","context":"## Shop 200+ Walmart doorbuster deals for Black Friday\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents What are Walmart's Black Friday hours in 2023? Is Walmart holding a Cyber Monday sale? TV deals Laptop deals Headphone\/earbud deals Tablet deals Smartwatch deals Gaming deals Speaker and soundbar deals Vacuum deals Robot vacuum deals Home and kitchen deals Outdoor deals Apple deals Pet deals Fitness deals Toys and gift deals\nUPDATE: Nov. 25, 2023, 4:00 a.m. EST We've updated this story with the latest deals from the Walmart early Cyber Monday sale.\nEarly birds already know that Walmart launched its first round of Black Friday deals back on Nov. 8 and just dished out another round the day before Thanksgiving. Some of the retailer's most popular rollbacks have already sold out. Leave items in your shopping cart too long and you'll risk losing out on your haul.\nAlthough the official Black Friday programming has kept us busy all month long, the big day has finally arrived \u2014 actual Black Friday. If you've held out until now to do your shopping, we've compiled a list of over 180 of the best deals from Walmart's Black Friday sale and highlighted our favorites from different departments. We'll be updating the list throughout Cyber Monday, so keep checking back.\nWhat are Walmart's Black Friday hours in 2023?\nThe days of lining up outside big-box stores on Black Friday eve have officially ended, and we're not sorry. Not only is this kinder on Walmart employees, but it puts the kibosh on the kinds of doorbuster melees that often took place in the past. (They were a national embarrassment.)\nFor 2023, Walmart launched its Black Friday deals online first, with the last round of rollbacks going live Wednesday, Nov. 22 at 3 p.m. ET. In-person shoppers had to wait until Friday, Nov. 24 at 6 a.m. when Walmart stores officially opened their doors, although hours can differ depending on the location. Shoppers will have until 11 p.m. to finish their Black Friday shopping.\nOf course, there's no need to brave the crowds. You can still find the best Walmart Black Friday sales online, and we've got a lot of them for you below.\nIs Walmart holding a Cyber Monday sale?\nGlad you asked. If you don't have time to shop the Black Friday sales or you missed out on a great deal earlier this month, don't you worry. Walmart just announced its official Cyber Monday sale will start on Sunday, Nov. 26 at 7 p.m. ET, exclusively on Walmart.com and the Walmart app. If you're a Walmart+, you can access the sale three hours in advance, starting at 4 p.m. ET. This is the first time Walmart has given early access to Walmart+ members for its Cyber Monday sale (although it usually does for Black Friday). The Cyber Monday sale promises deals on top gifts with savings of up to 80% on apparel, beauty, tech, toys, and more. Stay tuned for the best deals from the sale in the coming days.\nNote: All newly added deals are marked with a \u2728. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.\nTV deals\nWhy we like it\nThe best Walmart Black Friday deals typically include giant rollbacks on TVs, and that tradition continues in 2023. Unfortunately, many popular 4K TVs sold out way before Black Friday officially began, but there are still solid cheap 4K TVs lingering. This 55-inch QLED TV was already affordable at full price and is now seeing an extra $50 discount, pushing it below $350. Thanks to its extra layer of quantum dots, you'll be able to appreciate rich colors and deep blacks even during the day.\nMore TV deals\n43 to 55 inches\n65 inches\n70 to 86 inches\nLaptop deals\nWhy we like it\nThe total discount on this HP laptop isn't the biggest rollback we've seen so far, but it's a deceptively good deal on an underpriced laptop. With an Intel Core i5 processor, this business 2-in-1 will be more than capable of handling your day-to-day work (and after-work streaming and surfing). While supplies last, you can get this device for under $500.\nMore laptop deals\nTraditional laptops\n2-in-1 laptops\nGaming laptops\nHeadphone\/earbud deals\nWhy we like it\nIf you're not ready to make the switch over to USB-C just yet, the second-gen AirPods Pro with a Lightning port are a stellar buy at only $169 \u2014 it's their lowest price to date. (For its part, Amazon has never put them on sale for less than $189.) These wireless earbuds from fall 2022 \"sound wonderful and have almost uncanny active noise cancelation,\" said Mashable senior editor Stan Schroeder, and they last for up to six hours on a single charge.\nRead Mashable's review of the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation).\nMore headphone\/earbud deals\nTablet deals\nWhy we like it\nBest tablets under $100? Try best tablets under $30. Sure, this onn. tablet may not have all the functionality of an iPad, but if you're looking for a super basic tablet to watch videos or read on, you'll be hard-pressed to find anything in the $20 range. Even Fire tablets have only dropped down to $40 this Cyber Monday.\nMore tablet deals\nSmartwatch deals\nWhy we like it\nApple's latest entry-level wearable also has a new record-low price at Walmart for Black Friday (which works out to a 28% savings). It's lighter and 20 percent faster than the original Apple Watch SE from 2020, and it features most of the same health tools as the new flagship Apple Watch Series 9 \u2014 that includes heart rate notifications, Emergency SOS, Cycle Tracking, and Fall and Crash Detection. It also offers a comparable 18-hour battery life and water resistance.\nMore smartwatch deals\nGaming deals\nWhy we like it\nWith $439 as the new all-time low price for this Xbox bundle, you're basically getting a free copy of Diablo IV on top of a $60 discount on the Series X (which typically sells for $499.99 on its own). The only other retailer that was matching it at the time of writing was the Microsoft Store itself, and its markdown seems to have popped up recently in response to Walmart's doorbuster: A post on the Xbox Wire had previously pegged its Black Friday price there at $509.99.\nRead Mashable's review of the Xbox Series X.\nMore gaming deals\nNintendo Switch\nPlayStation\nXbox\nPC gaming\nVR gaming\nMeta Quest 2 (128GB) \u2014 $249 $299.99 (save $50.99) + free $50 Meta Quest Store credit\nOther gaming deals\nSpeaker and soundbar deals\nWhy we like it\nThe older version of our favorite portable Bluetooth speaker is decently loud for its compact size, IPX7-rated for waterproofing, and capable of charging other devices via USB (hence its name) \u2014 it's ideal for traveling. It usually retails for $179.95 on the JBL website, meaning Walmart's $89 Black Friday price is an even better deal than advertised.\nMore speaker and soundbar deals\nVacuum deals\nWhy we like it\nDyson's V15 Detect is a cordless stick vacuum with a fancy LCD screen and a bright built-in laser that illuminates tiny crumbs, pet hairs, and dust particles on your floors (so you can be sure you're actually cleaning them thoroughly); the premium Absolute variant has a shiny gold finish, HEPA filtration, and an extra dusting\/crevice tool. Walmart's Black Friday deal saves you 27% and makes it $100 cheaper than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, which has a smaller dust bin and less suction power.\nRead Mashable's review of the Dyson V15 Detect (non-Absolute).\nMore vacuum deals\nCordless vacuums\nMashable Deals Want more hand-picked deals in your inbox?

It maps your home and vacuums and mops the rooms you want it to, offering a more thorough cleaning with Matrix mode. During dry vacuuming, it cleans in a crosshatch pattern to grab any debris missed from the first pass, and during mopping, it scrubs the floor from multiple angles to eat away at stubborn stains.\nMore robot vacuum deals\nHome and kitchen deals\nWhy we like it\nVitamix's professional-quality blenders are great to buy refurbished: You'll save a ton of money while preventing an otherwise serviceable device from going to a landfill. This powerful, 64-ounce Explorian model has three program settings (for Smoothies, Hot Soup, and Frozen Desserts) and a low-profile container that lets it fit under most kitchen countertops. It's been cleaned and tested to work as good as new, save for a few hard-to-see \"micro-scratches,\" and comes with a one-year warranty.\nMore home and kitchen deals\nSmall appliances\nAir purifiers\nCookware\nOutdoor deals\nWhy we like it\nFeaturing a removable ashtray and a lightweight stainless steel design (plus its own carrying case), the Solo Stove Ranger 2.0 is a smaller version of our favorite smokeless fire pit \u2014 and yes, it really is virtually smokeless. This bundle throws in a stand that allows it to safely burn on decks or green grass, and it actually retails for $264.99 on the brand's website; Walmart's list price is slightly deflated, so it's an even better deal than it appears to be.\nRead Mashable's review of the Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0.\nMore outdoor deals\nApple deals\nWhy we like it\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 is \"a robust and elite wearable device \u2013 the best Apple has ever made,\" according to Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder. While it looks almost identical to its predecessor, it's equipped with a new s9 chip, which makes it about 30 percent snappier than before. It also boasts double the storage and has double the peak brightness and a fun new Double Tap feature. It's not an essential upgrade if you already have a Series 7 or 8, but it's certainly a step in the right direction for those with older watches. At $359 for the 45mm GPS version, it's currently sitting at an all-time low cost at Walmart.\nMore Apple deals\nPet deals\nWhy we like it\nA solid dog tracking device for pet parents on a budget, Tractive gives you the ability to track your dog's live location within the companion app. It also allows you to set up a virtual fence and notifies you when your pet steps out of (or enters) the safe area. It's not perfect \u2014 the battery is just so-so and the live tracking can be a bit glitchy \u2014 but for the price, it's hard to beat. Save $20 for Black Friday at Walmart and snag it for only $29.99.\nMore pet deals\nFitness deals\nWhy we like it\nThe Walmart-exclusive Echelon Connect Sport is a solid Peloton alternative for a retail price that won't make you cringe. And for Black Friday, it's on sale for over $400 off, knocking the price down to a super impressive $297. But just because it's wallet-friendly doesn't mean its specs don't impress. The Connect Sport features 32 levels of silent magnetic resistance, aero handlebars and adjustable pedals, and Bluetooth technology that lets you connect any smart device to the Echelon Fit app. Speaking of which, the app gives you access to 40+ daily live and 15,000+ on-demand connected fitness classes. The $297 Black Friday cost even includes a 30-day free trial of Echelon Premier membership to get you started.\nMore fitness deals\nToys and gift deals\nWhy we like it\nIn days gone by, Walmart's Black Friday sale was full of 40% or higher discounts, but the era of the doorbuster deal is ending. And that's why it's so refreshing to see a full 50% discount on a popular item like this. The LEGO Star Wars line includes tons of great gift ideas for fans of all ages, from Jedis to Padawans. This building kit of The Child, aka Baby Yoda, is just begging to live on your office desk.\nMore deals on toys and gifts\n\nThis article was published by Mashable on 2023-11-25 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":558}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nTravis Kelce believes the National Football League\u2019s coverage of his rumoured girlfriend Taylor Swift is a bit too much.\nFollowing his game against the New York Jets on 1 October, the 33-year-old Kansas City Chiefs tight end opened up about the NFL broadcast on the most recent episode of his podcast, New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce. In conversation with his brother Jason, 35, the two addressed concerns from longtime football enthusiasts who were frustrated by the constant Swift references throughout Sunday\u2019s game at MetLife Stadium.\nNot only did the football league promote last Sunday\u2019s game by speculating whether the Grammy winner will attend the Chiefs-Jets match, but cameras were constantly panning to the star-studded suite. During the game, Swift was joined an A-list group of guests, including her best friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner, and actor Hugh Jackman.\nThe NFL also introduced a special segment with Carson Daly and The Voice, where the famed host attempted to explain the specifics of football to \u201cSwifties.\u201d\nIn the New Heights podcase episode, titled \u201cThe NFL Needs to Calm Down\u201d, Jason asked his brother plainly whether he thought the football was \u201coverdoing it\u201d with the coverage of Swift during the game.\n\u201cI think everybody is just, like, overwhelmed,\u201d the Chiefs tight end replied.\n\u201cTake away your feelings for Taylor,\u201d Jason added. \u201cWhat is your honest opinion on how the NFL is treating celebrities at the games?\u201d\nSeemingly beating around the bush, Kelce remarked: \u201cI think it brings a little more to the atmosphere, it brings a little bit more to what you\u2019re watching. But at the same time, I think...\u201d\nBefore his younger brother could continue his thought, the Philadelphia Eagles player chimed in: \u201cThey\u2019re overdoing it.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re overdoing it a little bit, for sure,\u201d Kelce agreed. \u201cEspecially my situation. I think they\u2019re just trying to have fun with it.\u201d\nWhile sports lovers may not be too pleased with the NFL\u2019s focus on Swift, the football league\u2019s supposed obsession with ongoing Swift and Kelce dating rumours has paid off in terms of ratings. Per a Deadline report, NBC accumulated an average of 27m viewers, with a total of 29m tuning in during the second quarter.\n\u201cThat\u2019s gotta be an NFL record right there,\u201d Jason told his younger brother, as he noted that about two million viewers were estimated to be female. \u201cI think a few of them might have been there for Deadpool and, uh, Taylor.\u201d\nIn the YouTube comments under the New Heights video podcast, fellow fans shared their opinions on the NFL\u2019s coverage. \u201cI agree the NFL needs to calm down. Pissing off football fans is not how you repay your boi [sic] for all he\u2019s done for the sport,\u201d one person wrote.\nAnother remarked: \u201cPity Taylor. All she ever wanted was to watch the football game. Now she\u2019s being blamed and hated left and right.\u201d\n\u201cThe NFL needs to seriously tone it down and let Trav and Tay explore this beautiful thing they have going on in peace,\u201d someone else said.\nElsewhere in the podcast, the brothers revealed the one person who was most delighted to see famous musicians, actors, and professional athletes all coming together for Sunday\u2019s game was none other than \u201cMama Kelce,\u201d aka Donna Kelce. On 1 October, the NFL players\u2019 mother travelled from Philadelphia to New Jersey to watch both her sons play football on the same day.\n\u201cShe\u2019s been on top of the f***ing world, man,\u201d Kelce told his older brother. He also acknowledged how his mother seemed to be loving the new guests in her family suite, watching her son play along with her. \u201cI know mom enjoyed it,\u201d Kelce confessed.\n\u201cI shot her a text. I didn\u2019t get a chance to see her, so I shot her a text right after the game on the bus ride to the airport and was like: \u2018Hey, mom, sorry I didn\u2019t get to catch you before I left but I hope you enjoyed the game,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cI appreciate you always trying to make it to both of our games.\u201d\n\u201cShe also told me thank you because she was in an alternate universe, she was sitting there with Deadpooland Wolverine,\u201d Kelce added, referencing Reynolds\u2019 and Jackman\u2019s respective superhero movie characters. \u201cIt was a hot ticket, man, you know what I\u2019m saying? That suite was rockin\u2019.\n\u201cThey were enjoying themselves. Somebody told me that everybody was enjoying themselves in that suite,\u201d Kelce said.\nNot only has NFL viewership increased since Swift began attending her rumoured boyfriend\u2019s games, but jersey sales for the Chiefs tight end have reportedly spiked by 400 per cent, according to a report from the NFL\u2019s e-commerce partner, Fanatics.\nFollowing critcism the league is focusing too much on Swift, the NFL responded with an official statement handed to People on 4 October.\n\u201cWe frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what\u2019s happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,\u201d the message read. \u201cThe Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we\u2019ve leaned into in real time, as it\u2019s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we\u2019ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.\u201d\n\u201cThe vast majority of our content has remained focused on the game, our players and variety of other initiatives, including our Toy Story Funday Football alt-cast, the international games and more,\u201d they continued.\n\nThis article, authored by Kaleigh Werner, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-04 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":559}
{"title":"Inside the $US2.3b venue that will transform the concert industry","context":"## Inside the $US2.3b venue that will transform the concert industry\n\nBreathtaking is fair. Like the ABBA Voyage show in London, it is hard to capture in words. In many ways, it\u2019s a conventional space: there is tiered seating inside, and wallet-bruising bar snacks and merchandise for sale outside. Some parts of the rock concert experience will never change. But when the lights go down, everything changes. Around you, Sphere splits open to reveal a succession of environments, each more stunning than the one before. Though the structure is familiar - the audience seated in rows, the band on a single, central stage - the effect is overwhelming. In U2\u2019s show, we journey through a succession of environments referencing the band\u2019s creative history. For other projects, such as Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Postcard From Earth, the Sphere\u2019s sound system uses \u201chaptics\u201d to make the audience feel the sounds. U2 perform at the Sphere in Las Vegas. Credit: Stufish Entertainment Architects These are the technical specs: an interior 16K x 16K spherical video surface, the highest-resolution LED screen ever made with 268,435,456 pixels, and an exterior covered by 1.2 million hockey-puck-sized LEDs. There are 157,000 ultra-directional speakers \u2013 the boffins call it \u201cbeam-forming acoustics\u201d \u2013 and there are \u201cinfrasound haptics\u201d, which means the soundwaves are shaped to create both vibrations and waves of air pressure.\nThe comparison to ABBA\u2019s show in London is perhaps the only approximate one: both are wholly enveloping experiences where the lights, sound and special effects are blended to push the audience\u2019s senses to the limit. They differ in one key way; ABBA pushes its effects out toward you, largely to play smoke and mirrors with the on-stage simulacrums. Sphere, in contrast, more wholly and subtly envelops you. \u201cThey are both legacy projects made by artists who have the career and track record to be able to look at these things objectively in a way that a younger performer perhaps wouldn\u2019t because it takes an entire lifetime of experience to make those kinds of choices and make it work,\u201d Williams says. The two shows also share British music stage architecture firm Stufish whose work ranges from the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee, tours for Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Elton John and Madonna as well as the ABBA Arena in London. Stufish partner Ric Lipson (along with artist Es Devlin and producer Brian Eno) collaborated on the U2 project for Sphere. \u201cWith the ABBA Arena, it\u2019s absolutely designed for that show, but you could also imagine that building having another avatar show in there, or indeed a live performance where people would use the technology that\u2019s in the building as an immersive environment,\u201d Lipson says.\n\u201cThe Sphere does a similar thing, [in that] you have a fully immersive space, the video screen in the Sphere is vast, it has a huge number of pixels, and you can immerse the audience within this environment.\u201d So what does all this mean for the concert industry, which has historically built its lucrative concert spin-off industry on the conversion of sports venues to rock concert stages? It certainly means the future is looking a little more ... spherical? And, from a technological perspective, a little more plug-and-play. \u201cIt opens you up to thinking about performances in different ways, both from a creative point of view, from a business point of view, from a sustainability point of view, and the ability to not have to bring your own structure and screen and [sound system],\u201d Lipson says. ABBA\u2019s simulacrums on stage at ABBA Arena in London. Credit: Johan Persson \u201cWe have Adele in Caesar\u2019s Palace right now, which again is another large show that immerses the audience, but we bring everything in and every time we load that show out, it takes a week or so,\u201d Lipson adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about the Sphere idea is that they are planning multiple spheres, and then you can think about shows being able to move from sphere to sphere.\n\u201cBoth [the U2 and ABBA] shows are taking a bold stab at the next-generation way of doing shows,\u201d Lipson says, but notes that the traditional blueprint of iconic artist and audience remains key. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in a regular arena right now with Madonna, we are doing a very exciting show that pushes the limits of a pop show balancing staging and audience, and we are doing things that will feel fresh for her audience and for the show.\u201d Critically, says Lipson, the staging for the U2 show is elementary in real terms, despite its technological complexity. \u201cAnd what\u2019s interesting is that the Sphere, like ABBA Arena, is only touching the sides of what you can do,\u201d he says. \u201cIn five years\u2019 time and 10 years\u2019 time, two years\u2019 time, whenever the technology shifts, you\u2019ll be able to do more.\u201d By the numbers ... U2 perform at the Sphere in Las Vegas. Credit: Stufish Entertainment Architects The screens, for example, are a bespoke assembly of state-of-the-art screens. But behind those screens are \u201ca whole new kind of speaker,\u201d Lipson says. \u201cIn a regular show, the speakers are at one end pushing the sound down the room, so it\u2019s louder at the stage end and quieter further away. [But here] because everybody\u2019s sort of getting their own feed, everybody\u2019s getting an equal volume. So hearing the show in there, sonically, may be better than anywhere.\u201d When the Sphere venue is in cinema mode, it utilises the full range of haptics, that is its ability to shape sound into both vibrations that will literally shake your seat, but also waves of pressure that can be felt. To those, the haptic systems add both artificial wind and a range of scents, paired to key moments, such as scenes of rocket launches or wild storms. Scratch \u2019n sniff, anyone?\nAs far back as the 1950s, Hollywood used three synchronised 35mm projectors to send a single image into a huge, deeply curved screen and called it Cinerama. It clocked in at just 146-degrees, well short of the Sphere\u2019s 270-degree view. Another 1950s technology, Circle-Vision 360, essentially nine cameras positioned in an outward-facing circle, was used to create 360-degree film images, the most famous of which was Disneyland\u2019s America the Beautiful film. Drawing a little less fanfare than U2\u2019s debut on the Sphere stage was the premiere of Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Postcard From Earth, a 50-minute 18K resolution film shot to fit the 270-degree wraparound screen, using an 18K Big Sky camera, and featuring sequences shot in Greece, India, Mexico and the USA. The Big Sky, in layman\u2019s terms, delivers an image that is about 40 times greater in resolution than a 4K television screen. From Vegas to the desert ... U2 perform at the Sphere. Credit: Stufish Entertainment Architects Like Lipson, Williams is cautious about becoming lost in the dramatic differences of scale, particularly when it is the storytelling of the bands and their discographies that are the key draw for the audience. The same principles apply, Williams says, whether the show is U2 at Sphere or, in another of his shows, Australian playwright Suzie Miller\u2019s Prima Facie, starring Jodie Comer, on the substantially smaller stages of London\u2019s Harold Pinter Theatre and Broadway\u2019s John Golden Theatre.

The strategy was to stay calm, stay relaxed, stay focused \u2026 every minute of every round. This is a great finish to the year.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThere was only one round in which Wilder got the better of Parker.\n\u201cMy timing was off a little bit,\u201d Wilder said.\n\u201cHe did a great job of avoiding a lot of my punches. I did feel like I had the upper hand, but things happen. We move on to the next step.\u201d\nIn the main event, Wallin\u2019s corner called for the stoppage at the end of the fifth round.\nJoshua, a strong favourite, needed more than just a victory to convince sceptics his best days weren\u2019t behind him.\nThe British boxer earned some style points against the 33-year-old Wallin, who is from Sweden.\nJoshua (27-3-0) hadn\u2019t looked the same since holding the WBA, IBF and WBO titles. But the 34-year-old delivered a throwback performance, jabbing and moving forward with confidence while backing down Wallin (26-2-0).\nAdvertisement\nA strong right-left combination in the fifth round eventually led to the stoppage.\n\u201cJust another fight. I respect Otto,\u201d Joshua said.\n\u201cNot so much a throwback, just another day in the office.

{"title":"'Angels, demons, spirits and souls do exist,' says exorcist priest who warns against Ouija board use","context":"## 'Angels, demons, spirits and souls do exist,' says exorcist priest who warns against Ouija board use\n\nOuija boards and other attempts to converse with the dead are spiritually dangerous practices that should not be viewed as innocent fun, an exorcist priest told Fox News Digital.\n\"We too often forget that there is much more to this world than meets the eye,\" Fr. Dan Reehil told Fox News Digital. \"Angels, demons, spirits and souls do exist and they can have an impact on our life.\"\nRehill is a priest of the Diocese of Nashville. In 2018, he received exorcism training at Ateneo Pontificio Regina Apostolorum in Rome, and was installed as the exorcist of the Diocese of Nashville that same year.\nDO ANGELS EXIST? OVER HALF OF AMERICANS SAY YES, STUDY FINDS: \u2018COMFORT AND REASSURANCE\u2019\nAn exorcist, said Reehil, \"is a priest chosen and installed by a bishop to exercise the office of deliverance ministry. Exorcism is a specific form of prayer that the [Catholic] Church uses against the power of the devil.\"\nThe Catholic Church distinguishes between two forms of exorcisms, said Reehil. Exorcisms are either \"major\" or \"minor.\"\n\"A major exorcism is performed only for one, who is demonstrably possessed by a demon or demons, and may only be performed by a priest the bishop has specifically permitted to do so,\" said Reehil.\nConversely, a minor exorcism is associated with sacraments and blessings, said Reehil.\n\"Demonologists distinguish three levels of demonic incursion,\" explained Reehil. These three levels are temptation, obsession (which is also called \"oppression\") and possession.\n'HALLOW' PRAYER APP ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL DURING THE GOP DEBATE, COMPANY SAYS: 'PRAY WITH ME REAL QUICK'\nTemptation, said Reehil, is something experienced by everyone.\nObsession is \"when demons torment people physically, spiritually, mentally or emotionally, or some combination of these.\"\nPossession, which is arguably the most well-known of the three levels, is when a demon or demons \"take physical possession of a person's body and make use of its faculties,\" said Reehil.\n\"Possession is usually intermittent, almost never an uninterrupted possessing of the person\u2019s body,\" he added.\nAttempting occult practices, such as purportedly trying to contact the dead via an Ouija board, are a way to open oneself up to demonic activity inadvertently, said Reehil.\n\"Demons lie and impersonate dead people,\" said Reehil. \"When asking a board for information about a deceased person, or a life decision, they are all too happy to embed themselves into your life. Using an Ouija board is inviting a demon into your life, whether the person has that intention or not.\"\nThe Ouija board was first developed in the late 19th century as a parlor game; these were formerly called \"talking boards.\"\nAt the time, s\u00e9ances and other spiritual practices were quite popular activities.\nAS CATHOLIC CHURCH FACES PRECARIOUS CULTURAL TIME, BISHOP ROBERT BARRON OF MINNESOTA MODELS THOUGHTFUL FAITH\nThe board consists of an alphabet, the words \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"goodbye,\" and the numbers zero through nine.\nTo operate the board, a person places their hands on a \"planchette,\" which spirits purportedly move to spell out answers to questions.\nIn 1890, a Baltimore spiritualist and medium named Helen Peters asked the talking board what she should call it, said the website for the Talking Board Historical Society. The board responded \"O-U-I-J-A,\" which it said meant \"good luck.\"\nThe Ouija board was patented the following year.\nLegend regarding the Ouija board's patent says that Peters accompanied attorney Elijah Bond to the patent office, where the two were instructed by the patent officer to prove that the board worked by spelling out his name, said Smithsonian Magazine.\nTHE EXORCIST, CHUCKY AND NEW HORRIFIC HAUNTS HIT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS ORLANDO'S HALLOWEEN HORROR NIGHTS\nPeters reportedly asked spirits for assistance, and then spelled out the patent officer's name.\nIt is unclear if Bond or Peters somehow knew the patent officer's name ahead of time, but the patent was awarded on Feb. 10, 1891, by a \"white-faced and visibly shaken patent officer,\" said the magazine.\nThe boards were then mass-produced by the Kennard Novelty Company, which was sold to Parker Brothers in 1967.\nToday, the Ouija board is produced by Hasbro, which markets the product as a way to communicate with the \"spirit world.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Hasbro for comment but did not hear back by publication time.\n\"Enter the world of the mysterious and mystifying with the Ouija board! You've got questions and the spirit world has answers \u2014 and the uncanny Ouija board is your way to get them,\" said the Hasbro website.\nHALLOWEEN HORROR MOVIE HOMES AND THE STORIES BEHIND THEM: WOULD YOU DARE TO VISIT?\n\"What do you want to know? Ask your question with a friend using the planchette that comes with the board, but be patient and concentrate because the spirits can't be rushed. Handle the Ouija board with respect and it won't disappoint you,\" said the website.\nWhile the Ouija board is marketed as a toy or board game, Reehil, from his point of view, disagrees with this characterization.\nDivination and other occult practices are condemned by the Bible numerous times, said Fr. Reehil.\n\"Ouija boards should not be viewed in the same way as a typical board game,\" he said. \"Although it is advertised as a game, it is far from it,\" he added. \"Rather, it is a form of divination.\"\nDivination and other occult practices are condemned by the Bible numerous times, Reehil noted.\n\"The very action of using [the Ouija board] has profound spiritual consequences [that are] beyond our control,\" he said.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nPerhaps the most famous instance of purported demonic possession connected to Ouija board usage was the case of \"Roland Doe,\" a young teenage boy from Maryland, who underwent numerous major exorcisms in 1949, said Reehil.\nDoe's story was adapted into the 1971 book \"The Exorcist\" by William Peter Blatty, which was then made into the 1973 movie starring Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair.\nReehil told Fox News Digital that he has personally seen six cases of demonic oppression that stemmed from Ouija board usage.\n\"The victims were left with night terrors, suicidal ideation, despair \u2014 and one man was impaled with chicken bones in his leg that flew across the kitchen,\" he said.\n\"Stay away from all forms of occult practices \u2014 and stay close to God.\"\n\"Once the deliverance prayers were prayed, and the participants renounced all participation with the demons, the demonic activity ceased,\" he also said.\n\"Whenever we seek to engage demons, we move away from the One True God,\" said Reehil.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAdded the priest, \"Stay away from all forms of occult practices \u2014 and stay close to God.\"\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com\/lifestyle.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Lifestyle on 2023-10-30 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":562}
{"title":"The best horror movies you can watch right now","context":"## The best horror movies you can watch right now\n\nYour time is precious, and your options are endless. The good news: We watch it all so you don\u2019t have to. Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\nWhether it\u2019s something gory and macabre, silly and irreverent, or eerie and unsettling, the genre of horror is as rich and varied as the multitude of ghosts, ghoulies, and homicidal maniacs that go bump in the night.\nLooking for the best horror films available to stream on Netflix, Hulu, Max, and Paramount Plus? No worries, we\u2019ve got the goods. We\u2019ve combed through the libraries of each of the major streaming platforms to bring you a list of our most recommended horror movies. Here are the best horror movies you can stream right now, from old classics to new hits. Our latest update added Encounters of the Spooky Kind.\nEditor\u2019s pick: Encounters of the Spooky Kind\nDirector: Sammo Hung\nCast: Sammo Hung, Chung Fat, Dick Wei\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel\nThis Halloween, I had one goal: Finally watch Sammo Hung\u2019s jiangshi (Chinese hopping vampire) martial arts comedy Encounters of the Spooky Kind. It was finally added to streaming via the Criterion Channel earlier this fall after years of being unavailable digitally. And reader, my priorities were correct, because this movie is an absolute blast.\nBest known for his collaborations with childhood friends Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, Sammo\u2019s excellence as a director, choreographer, and performer are on full display in what is frequently a one-man show.\nSammo directed the movie, co-wrote it, choreographed the action, and stars as Bold Cheung, a pedicab driver and skilled martial artist who\u2019s also kind of a dolt. He is dared to spend the night in a haunted house with a hopping vampire \u2014 a dare he accepts, because he is \u201cBold\u201d Cheung, after all. What follows is a Looney Tunes-style slapstick action horror movie with legitimate scares (the vampire makeup is terrific: gray with a gross texture, like a wet papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask), dazzling rhythmic martial arts choreography, and perfectly placed dashes of comedy (there\u2019s even an extended Duck Soup homage).\nSammo is truly one of the greatest directors to ever do it, but he doesn\u2019t get the proper credit globally because of the genres (and nation) he\u2019s primarily worked in. The jaw-dropping choreography and onslaught of funny bits are outstanding, but it\u2019s his skill with the camera that has always separated Sammo from his counterparts.\nBringing it back to his old friend Yuen Biao for a second \u2014 Biao co-stars as the silent vampire, and does a terrific job selling the undead creature\u2019s fight sequences with stiff limbs and startling hops. This movie is colorful, funny, scary, tense, and an incredibly fun time. If you like the Evil Dead movies, this is one you must check out; Sam Raimi basically directly ripped one of Spooky Kind\u2019s fight sequences for Evil Dead II. \u2014Pete Volk\nAlone\nDirector: John Hyams\nCast: Jules Willcox, Marc Menchaca, Anthony Heald\nWhere to watch: Hulu, Kanopy\nA taut spine-chiller from John Hyams (Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning), Alone is your classic woman-on-the-run thriller. Jessica (Jules Willcox), a recent widow, is in the midst of moving. If that wasn\u2019t enough stress, a creepy man (Marc Menchaca) appears to be following her on the road. After he slashes her tires, she crashes and wakes up in his basement. What follows is a tightly crafted thriller with great performances, outstanding direction, and enough tension to keep your heart pounding throughout the 98-minute running time. \u2014Pete Volk\nAnnihilation\nDirector: Alex Garland\nCast: Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nAnnihilation might be the creepiest movie about plants ever made (with all due respect to The Ruins.)\nAnnihilation follows a group of scientists (played by a phenomenal group of actors) investigating an area struck by a meteor. The area that was hit has slowly spread and grown into what\u2019s now known as The Shimmer, an area where nature seems to be taking over everything around it, but it\u2019s a different kind of nature; strange, unnaturally green plants grow over everything, and creatures (animals and humans) slowly merge with the vegetation around them. At the center of all of this is a lighthouse the group must reach. Annihilation helps realize this strange Earth-but-not incredibly well, with beautiful and haunting production design and a finale as memorable as any horror movie on this list. \u2014 Austen Goslin\nClimax\nDirector: Gaspar No\u00e9\nCast: Sofia Boutella, Romain Guillermic, Souheila Yacoub\nWhere to watch: Showtime\nClimax isn\u2019t for the faint-of-heart \u2014 and we\u2019re saying that in the context of a horror movies list. The movie is set at an all-night dance party inside a gymnasium, which turns sour after someone spikes the sangria with a little too much LSD. Climax is told in beautifully disorienting long takes that go from dozens of minutes of uninterrupted and propulsive dance sequences to hazy walks through hallways as the camera mimics the dizzy stumbling of the movie\u2019s characters. As the psychedelics kick in, so too do some of the attendees\u2019 long-held feuds, leading to disastrous and horrifying consequences. It\u2019s rare that a movie truly defies description, but if you\u2019ve got a strong stomach and a will to see something you haven\u2019t before, Climax is the perfect movie for you. \u2014AG\nCrimes of the Future\nDirector: David Cronenberg\nCast: Viggo Mortensen, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Kristen Stewart\nWhere to watch: Hulu\nMicroplastics: They\u2019re everywhere!\nThey\u2019re in our lungs, our blood, our food and drinking water; even the air we breathe. What the fuck is it doing to our bodies? We don\u2019t really know, but David Cronenberg\u2019s 2022 body horror drama sure has an idea of what it might mean for our children. Crimes of the Future imagines a world where humans have lost the ability to feel pain. In addition to that, several people have developed a disturbing disorder which causes their bodies to spontaneously spawn new organs.\nThis new reality has spawned a trend: Live surgery, wherein performance artists plagued with this condition tear into their own bodies in an effort to shape meaning out of this strange new biological fact. Viggo Mortensen stars as Saul Tenser, a world-renowned performance artist who, alongside his partner Caprice (L\u00e9a Seydoux), stands on the cutting edge \u2014 both literally and figuratively \u2014 of this cultural phenomenon. When Saul\u2019s activities catch the attention of a mysterious group of evolutionary activists, as well as the lascivious eye of a government employee named Timlin (Kristen Stewart), he\u2019s forced to confront what he \u2014 and everyone else around him \u2014 is changing into, and whether what that is can even be considered \u201chuman\u201d anymore.\nAs macabre as it is moving, grotesque as it is sensuous; Crimes of the Future is an exquisite work of science fiction horror where surgery is the new sex and our very bodies have rebelled against us for the incalculable destruction we have inflicted on the planet. It\u2019s a film that exists in intimate conversation with the anxieties of our present, as well as one that represents a stunning return to form for one of cinema\u2019s most forward-thinking directors. Howard Shore\u2019s growling, guttural score is engrossing, while the leading trio of performances by Mortensen, Seydoux, and Stewart are a virtual match made in heaven in bringing to life this speculative slice of post-human hell on Earth. In short: It\u2019s a great film and highly recommended, but whatever you do, don\u2019t see it on a full stomach. Trust me. \u2014Toussaint Egan\nCure\nDirector: Kiyoshi Kurosawa\nCast: K\u014dji Yakusho, Tsuyoshi Ujiki, Anna Nakagawa\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel\nKiyoshi Kurosawa\u2019s 1997 horror masterpiece Cure follows Kenichi Takabe (K\u014dji Yakusho), a Japanese detective frustrated by an inexplicable rash of seemingly unconnected murders that nevertheless all appear to be connected, despite none of the perpetrators having known each other or having any recollection as to what possessed them to do it. When Takabe\u2019s investigation leads him to a suspect, a student of psychology and mesmerism known as Mamiya (Masato Hagiwara), he finds himself plunged into a conspiracy that threatens to engulf anyone who gets too close.\nIn Cure, violence is less an act of premeditation or passion as it is a virus, coursing its way through the bloodstream of society, corrupting innocent bystanders not unlike aberrant cancer cells attacking from within without ever understanding why they did so in the first place. How do you confront a horror like that, much less stop it? The answer is as simple as it is terrifying: You can\u2019t. \u2014TE\nEyes Without a Face\nDirector: Georges Franju\nCast: Pierre Brasseur, \u00c9dith Scob, Alida Valli\nWhere to watch: Max, The Criterion Channel\nGeorges Franju\u2019s influential 1960 film is a master class in supernatural fantasy horror. An unsettling tale about a plastic surgeon (played by Pierre Brasseur) who kidnaps young women and performs surgery on them to try and find a face replacement for his daughter (\u00c9dith Scob), Eyes Without a Face is equal parts haunting and beautiful. Scob\u2019s iconic face mask in the movie was later referenced in her role in the also-excellent Holy Motors many decades later. \u2014PV\nHellraiser\nDirector: Clive Barker\nCast: Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, AMC+, Shudder, Tubi, Pluto, Hoopla\nClive Barker\u2019s 1987 directorial debut adapts his 1986 novella The Hellbound Heart to tell the story of Larry (Andrew Robinson) and Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins). The Cottons are a married couple who move into the home of Larry\u2019s recently deceased brother, Frank (Sean Chapman), with whom Julia had a previous affair. After inadvertently being resurrected by a drop of blood spilled by Larry on the floor of the house\u2019s attic, Frank seduces Julia into luring new men to the house so that he can drain their life force and fully regain his mortal form. Surrounding this core narrative is the the story of the Lament Configuration, a puzzle box Frank acquired before his untimely death. When solved, it conjures hellish beings known as Cenobites to the mortal plane of existence, which indulge in hellish exercises of sadomasochistic mutilation. Easily the best and most enduring of the Hellraiser movie series, Barker\u2019s 1987 original is a must-watch for horror fans. \u2014TE\nHereditary\nDirector: Ari Aster\nCast: Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro\nWhere to watch: Max\nHereditary is a victim of its own success. The poster child for the misguided term \u201celevated horror,\u201d and the subject of more than a few memes (particularly around telephone poles), the thing that often gets lost about Hereditary is that it\u2019s actually really fucking good. And it\u2019s damn scary too.\nThe movie follows Annie Graham, a difficult mother of two, who just lost her mom. During the funeral service, Annie notices quite a few people are here to mourn the mother she thought had no friends. She eventually learns this group of old people all belonged to the same bizarre semi-cult her mother did. And that\u2019s where the witchy stuff starts.\nFrom there everything descends into a complicated mishmash of tightly coiled family drama, supernatural plotting, and years-old resentments, and it\u2019s absolutely excellent. Who\u2019s to say which is scarier in this movie, the verbal immolation or the literal one?\nEven if you\u2019ve seen it already, you probably owe this movie a rewatch. You definitely remember that it\u2019s good, but you probably don\u2019t remember just how great it really is. Hereditary is elegantly creepy, right up until the point that it becomes terrifying. You can\u2019t really ask any more from a horror movie than that. \u2014Austen Goslin\nThe Host\nDirector: Bong Joon-ho\nCast: Song Kang-ho, Byun Hee-bong, Park Hae-il\nWhere to watch: Max, Roku Channel, Hoopla, Kanopy\nThe Host was Bong Joon-ho\u2019s follow-up to the smash success serial killer drama Memories of Murder. A critical and commercial success, it was the highest-grossing South Korean film ever after its release and won Best Film at the Asian Film Awards and the Blue Dragon Film Awards.\nYears after chemicals are dumped into the Han River, a huge mutated fish monster emerges and kidnaps a young girl. Her father (Song Kang-ho) sets out to find and rescue her, before being kidnapped by the American scientists responsible for its existence. A fun monster thriller that doubles as insightful commentary on U.S. intervention, ecological disasters, and much more, The Host is a high mark in Bong\u2019s impressive filmography. \u2014PV\nHouse\nDirector: Nobuhiko Obayashi\nCast: Kimiko Ikegami, Miki Jinbo, Kumiko Ohba\nWhere to watch: Max, Criterion Channel\nFew movies are as weird and excellent as Nobuhiko Obayashi\u2019s House.\nThe bizarre ghost story follows a group of school girls who take a vacation to a haunted mansion in the countryside of Japan. Everything starts off well enough, but before long the kids are being attacked by demonic gates, getting eaten by pianos, or opening portals to hell \u2014 all with visually an inventive silliness few movies have ever matched. House isn\u2019t all that scary, but it is weird in all the best ways, and nothing else looks or feels like it. \u2014 AG\nIn the Mouth of Madness\nDirector: John Carpenter\nCast: Sam Neill, Julie Carmen, Jurgen Prochnow\nWhere to watch: YouTube\nAmong the wildest movies John Carpenter has ever made (and that\u2019s saying something), In the Mouth of Madness follows insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill), who is hired to find a missing fame horror novelist. Things become increasingly unhinged as the plots of the author\u2019s books and the various monsters seem to invade the real world. Neill, a staple of this list, is absolutely fantastic responding to the horrors of hell, slowly becoming exactly as off-kilter as they are. By the time the movie makes it to the third act, the door to hell is halfway open and Trent is ready to dive headfirst into the void, which is honestly how every movie\u2019s third act should go.\nThis is also the third in Carpenter\u2019s apocalypse trilogy, which also includes two other stone-cold classics, The Thing and Prince of Darkness. They aren\u2019t on this list, but you should watch them anyway. \u2014 AG\nLet the Right One In\nDirector: Tomas Alfredson\nCast: K\u00e5re Hedebrant, Lina Leandersson, Per Ragnar\nWhere to watch: Hulu, Prime Video, Roku Channel, Crackle, Hoopla, Kanopy\nA 12-year-old Swedish boy finds a friend in a vampire who looks roughly his age, but is actually an old vampire permanently trapped in the body of a young child. The film is kaleidoscopic, each viewing revealing something different than the last. The first time I saw the film, I was a pessimistic college student, and I read the central relationship as a warning about the parasitic nature of love. After college, the children\u2019s bond reminded me of the impermanence of youth, and why growing up is a mixed blessing. This past year, I was far more focused on the girl\u2019s relationship with her caretaker, an older man who sacrifices everything for her existence.\nThe film was adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvist\u2019s 2004 novel of the same name, which inspired not just this Swedish film, but a 2010 American adaptation, a comic-book prequel, and two stage plays. The latter has its own legacy \u2014 it was adapted by the magnificent National Theater of Scotland, and it eventually had a run at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse in 2015. Few books inspire so much additional great art. So I suppose I\u2019m recommending the book just as much as the film. \u2014Chris Plante\nMalignant\nDirector: James Wan\nCast: Annabelle Wallis, Maddie Hasson, George Young\nWhere to watch: Max\nThere was just no way to see it coming. After the Conjuring and Insidious franchises, plus blockbuster turns with Furious 7 and Aquaman, James Wan could have cashed in chips to make another moody franchise-starter to stretch his jump-scare muscles. Instead, he made Malignant, a high-emotion giallo stuffed into dingy \u201990s direct-to-video pastiche like some kind of horror-movie turducken. Wan pulls back the layers in an almost tedious fashion: The pregnant Madison (Annabelle Wallis) is first the victim of domestic abuse, then she encounters another killer, and then she starts dealing with psychotic episodes tied to her childhood imaginary friend Gabriel, and theeeeen it\u2019s revealed\u2026 Well, please go behold it.\nStrung together with a melodramatic cover of The Pixies\u2019 \u201cWhere Is My Mind,\u201d reveling in horror tropes to the point of parody, the final twists of Malignant are some of the most gratifying lunacy of the year, and the acrobatic actor Marina Mazepa brings it all home in a display of gruesome ballet. I won\u2019t explain anything more out of fear of spoilers \u2014 just get on the Malignant train. Wan put his dream (nightmare?) on screen for us all to enjoy. \u2014Matt Patches\nThe Mist\nDirector: Frank Darabont\nCast: Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden\nWhere to watch: Digital rental\/purchase\nAny fan of Stephen King worth their salt knows that the so-called king of horror has a lot of movie adaptations of his work. Few films have managed to eclipse, let alone successfully adapt, King\u2019s capacity for horror storytelling, with the exception of (a) Stanley Kubrick\u2019s The Shining and (b) Frank Darabont\u2019s The Mist.\nDarabont\u2019s third adaptation of a Stephen King story, the film stars Thomas Jane (The Expanse) as a Hollywood poster artist living in Maine who, along with his wife and son and the rest of his neighbors, takes shelter in a supermarket in the wake of a mysterious storm that covers the town in a deadly mist.\nSupernatural, otherworldly horrors abound throughout The Mist, but the greatest horror of all is \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 humanity itself, as seen in the way the townspeople succumb to the temptation to scapegoat those among themselves under the influence of a local religious fanatic. The ending is a gut-punch and sincerely one of the most chilling in any mainstream horror film of its time. If you\u2019ve managed to go unspoiled until now, I won\u2019t ruin the surprise, but needless to say, it\u2019s worth it. \u2014TE\nNight of the Living Dead\nDirector: George A. Romero\nCast: Duane Jones, Judith O\u2019Dea, Marilyn Eastman\nWhere to watch: Max, Peacock, MGM Plus, Paramount Plus, Roku Channel\nThe movie that launched the modern zombie film in the United States, George A. Romero\u2019s debut feature was written, directed, photographed, and edited by the nascent zombie film master on a shoestring budget, which only adds to the eerie atmosphere and grounded terror. In this film, a group of survivors hide out in an abandoned house in western Pennsylvania at the start of a zombie apocalypse. Led by the level-headed Ben (Duane Jones), the group not only has to deal with the conflict of zombies trying to break in, but internal conflicts stemming from disagreements on how to handle their precarious predicament.\nNight of the Living Dead is the first example of Romero\u2019s typical blend of jaw-dropping (and stomach-churning) practical effects and astute social commentary. Fun fact: This movie came out a month before the MPAA film rating system, which meant a heaping amount of controversy when children were able to see the quite graphic movie in theaters. And another fun fact: Night of the Living Dead was never copyrighted and is in the public domain because of an error by the original theatrical distributor. \u2014PV\nPossession\nDirector: Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski\nCast: Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill, Heinz Bennent\nWhere to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus, Metrograph\nOutside of the most ardent of cinephile circles, Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski isn\u2019t a name that inspires enthusiastic recognition in the United States. Known for his transgressive brand of arthouse cinema, \u017bu\u0142awski\u2019s career was stymied by Communist authorities in his homeland of Poland, with many of his early films being either heavily censored, banned, or, in one instance, nearly destroyed upon release. It also doesn\u2019t help that the few films of his that have been released in the States have since gone out of print \u2014 though that appears to be changing soon.\nIf you do know \u017bu\u0142awski\u2019s name, it\u2019s likely for his 1981 psychological horror film Possession, a film whose cult status among horror connoisseurs has only been amplified in the decades since its release by its difficulty to obtain on physical media or to view online. Fortunately for everyone, that\u2019s no longer the case.\nSet in Cold War-era West Berlin, \u017bu\u0142awski\u2019s film stars Jurassic Park\u2019s Sam Neill as Mark, a Russian spy who returns home to find that his wife, Anna (Isabelle Adjani), has left him and wants a divorce. When Anna refuses to divulge why, only saying that she has not left him for someone else, Mark grows suspicious and has her tailed. What he eventually discovers is a horrifying secret beyond his comprehension, one which awakens a long-dormant wellspring of anxiety, resentment, and despair between the two that threatens to tear apart not only their small family, but their very sanity as well.\nInspired by \u017bu\u0142awski\u2019s own tumultuous divorce in 1976 and his subsequent struggles with suicidal ideation, Possession blurs the line between the autobiographical and the phantasmagorical, with hysterical performances by Neill and Adjani that vacillate between disturbing, comical, and disquietingly sympathetic. An inspiration for everything from Ari Aster\u2019s Midsommar to the 2016 music video for Massive Attack\u2019s \u201cVoodoo in My Blood,\u201d Possession is an essential watch for any serious horror fan. \u2014TE\n[REC]\nDirectors: Jaume Balaguero, Paco Plaza\nCast: Manuela Velasco, Ferran Terraza, Martha Carbonell\nWhere to watch: Prime Video\nOne of the best and most disturbing found-footage movies ever, [REC] follows a TV reporter and camera person who follow emergency workers into an apartment building, only to discover the dark truth inside: Some of the residents are turning into monsters. Set squarely in the zombie-craze of the mid-2000s, [REC]\u2019s undead creatures owe quite a bit to the raving cannibal infected of 28 Days Later, but the Spanish movie\u2019s flesh-eaters are quite a bit creepier and more disturbed than their predecessors. While many found-footage movies obscure their scariest moments, [REC] uses the format to enhance its creeping dread and drag out the character\u2019s slow careful exploration of the apartment building, ramping the tension up to 11 just in time for the downright terrifying finale. \u2014 AG\nSputnik\nDirector: Egor Abramenko\nCast: Oksana Akinshina, Fedor Bondarchuk, Pyotr Fyodorov\nWhere to watch: Hulu\nIf you\u2019re hungry for a great piece of contemporary Russian sci-fi horror (i.e., something not directed by either Andrei Tarkovsky or Yakov Protazanov), then Egor Abramenko\u2019s 2020 directorial debut is just the film you\u2019re looking for.\nSet during 1983 at the height of Cold War tensions, Sputnik (which for your information is Russian for \u201cfellow traveler\u201d) centers on Tatyana (Oskana Akinshina), an uncompromising young psychiatrist with a staunch attitude with regard to the ends justifying the means. Tatyana is recruited by the Soviet military to treat Konstantin (Pyotr Fyodorov), a wounded cosmonaut and the lone survivor of a mysterious satellite crash. Only upon arriving at the remote hospital facility housing the patient and interacting with him does Tatyana come to realize the horrifying truth: Konstantin did not in fact return from space alone; rather, his body has now become the unwitting host to an organism unlike anything seen on Earth. Caught between her duty to study the creature and her desire to save Konstantin from further harm, Tatyana must make a hard decision upon which the very survival of all humanity may rest.\nWhat makes Abramenko\u2019s debut so compelling is how it takes the basic premise of the \u201ctrolley problem\u201d thought experiment and twists it repeatedly (and successfully) to dramatic emotional effect. Akinshina (The Bourne Supremacy) delivers a convincing and compelling performance as Tatyana, a woman forced to confront and overcome the uncompromising attitude that had once assured her success but now threatens to endanger not only another man\u2019s life, but potentially the lives of everyone on the planet along with her own soul. Fyodorov, for his own part, delivers a sympathetically complex (and on occasion, implicitly sinister) performance as Konstantin, a Russian \u201chero\u201d torn between his perceived duty to his country and his emotional obligation to a loved one he all but abandoned before embarking on his most recent mission. The creature design in this movie is terrific, as is the cinematography and the film\u2019s score.\nHaving previously been slated for a world premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival and subsequently dumped on video-on-demand in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sputnik is exactly the kind of horror movie this list was intended to spotlight: a kind of rare gem of intellectually and viscerally stimulating horror that otherwise goes unappreciated if not given the opportunity to shine. \u2014TE\nSuspiria\nDirector: Dario Argento\nCast: Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Flavio Bucci\nWhere to watch: Tubi, Kanopy\nOne of the best-looking movies of all time with one of the best soundtracks of all time. What\u2019s better than that?\nDario Argento\u2019s Suspiria tells the story of Suzy Bannion, an American dancer who moves to Germany to study at the prestigious Tanz Akademie. It just so happens that the academy is run by witches. As the facade of the school unravels, Suzy\u2019s fellow students slowly start going missing or dropping dead in increasingly bizarre and horrible ways.\nWhile the plot for Suspiria is interesting, what really makes the movie great is how it looks and how it sounds. Everything about the production design, the costumes, and the colors is eccentric in ways no other horror movie has ever matched. Couple all that with the incredible and haunting soundtrack from European rock band Goblin, and Suspiria becomes an unforgettable horror classic that everyone should see at least once. \u2014 AG\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre\nDirector: Tobe Hooper\nCast: Marilyn Burns, Gunnar Hansen, Allen Danziger\nWhere to watch: Peacock, Shudder, AMC Plus, Tubi, Freevee\nAnother shoestring production gone huge, Tobe Hooper\u2019s 1974 masterpiece made over $30 million at the box office on a budget of around $140,000. The movie follows a group of friends who find themselves hunted by a family of cannibals in the middle of Texas, and is a chilling, violent fever dream that permanently lodges itself in the minds of those who watch it.\nEight films have followed, including a Netflix version in 2022, but the original stands out as an unhinged encapsulation of pure chaos and terror. At a tight 83 minutes, the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre is well worth the small time investment to catch up on one of the most influential horror movies ever made. \u2014PV\nThe Thing\nDirector: John Carpenter\nCast: Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David\nWhere to watch: Peacock\nJohn Carpenter\u2019s postmodern creature feature takes the idea of alien monsters and makes them simultaneously more recognizable and more gross and unworldly than in any other movie in history. The Thing, the second adaptation of the excellent novella Who Goes There?, remains thrilling, terrifying, and absolutely disgusting more than 40 years after its release.\nThe Thing follows a group of researchers working at an Antarctic base. Suddenly, a dog from a local Norwegian camp rushes into their base, with Norwegian men hot on its heels, trying to kill it by any means necessary. However, once the American crew takes the dog in and shelters it, they discover it\u2019s an alien that can transform into any living creature, mimicking it perfectly \u2014 and that makes every one of them a suspect.\nIt\u2019s one of the great paranoid thriller premises of all time, but it just so happens to also be filled with gross and fantastic alien gore. There\u2019s nothing quite like The Thing. \u2014AG\nThe Unfriended movies\nDirector: Levan \u201cLeo\u201d Gabriadze (Unfriended); Stephen Susco (Unfriended: Dark Web)\nCast: Shelley Hennig, Moses Storm, Renee Olstead (Unfriended); Colin Woodell, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Betty Gabriel (Unfriended: Dark Web)\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel (Unfriended); Digital rental\/purchase (Both movies)\nAs many people have learned over the past few years, there aren\u2019t that many things scarier than a video call you can\u2019t leave.\nA masterfully contained horror movie that makes full use of its (at the time) groundbreaking gimmick, Unfriended is a tense teen horror movie that takes place entirely on a character\u2019s laptop screen. Definitely watch it on a laptop if you can, and check out the very good sequel Unfriended: Dark Web if you dug this one. \u2014PV\nFrom our list of the best horror movies on Netflix:\nLevan Gabriadze\u2019s Unfriended pulls the audiences through the screen \u2014 almost literally. Viewed entirely from the perspective of a computer desktop, 2014 supernatural horror film centers around a Skype call between a group of high school students who are joined by an unknown presence known only as \u201cbillie227.\u201d What at first appears to be a prank swiftly morphs into something much more horrific, as the mysterious stranger begins to reveal terrifying secrets about each of the friends before killing them off one by one. Unfriended is thoroughly gripping extrapolation of our always-online world, a world where vengeful poltergeists and doxxing exist side by side and no secret or offense goes undiscovered or unpunished. \u2014TE\nUs\nDirector: Jordan Peele\nCast: Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nJordan Peele\u2019s already a horror master just three movies into his career, but Us probably still doesn\u2019t have the reputation it deserves. His 2019 psychological slasher had the unfortunate fate of following up the cultural phenomenon of Get Out, so it had a hard time breaking through, in the way that sophomore projects often do. But taken on its own terms, Us is a fantastic little horror movie with tons of atmosphere and an underground society\u2019s worth of great scares.\nThe movie follows the Wilson family, whose vacation is interrupted by the arrival of a group of doppelg\u00e4ngers who match up with each member of the family perfectly. The clones, it turns out, are called Tethered, and where they come from is very complicated. But before any kind of explanation of the Tethered, what we see is a parade of violent attacks, home invasions, and some very tense encounters between Lupita Nyong\u2019o and herself.\nUs may not be Peele\u2019s best movie, but it is a fascinating mix of slasher thrills and world- building, supported by a fantastic cast all operating at their A games. While the entire cast is great, Elizabeth Moss is a particular standout for her extremely brief but extraordinarily loathsome role as one of the family\u2019s friends. Her performance gives this movie so much of its weird off-kilter vibe, and leads to some of its most unstintingly and gleefully over-the-top violence. Alongside the terrifying tone, Peele manages to build an entire second world underneath our own, and will give you a very unhealthy fear of what you\u2019re really seeing when you look in the mirror. \u2014AG\n\nThis article, authored by Toussaint Egan, was published by Polygon on 2023-09-28 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":563}
{"title":"EU lawmakers bag late night deal on \u2018global first\u2019 AI rules","context":"## EU lawmakers bag late night deal on \u2018global first\u2019 AI rules\n\nAfter marathon \u2018final\u2019 talks which stretched to almost three days European Union lawmakers have tonight clinched a political deal on a risk-based framework for regulating artificial intelligence. The file was originally proposed back in April 2021 but it\u2019s taken months of tricky three-way negotiations to get a deal over the line. The development means a pan-EU AI law is definitively on the way.\nGiving a triumphant but exhausted press conference in the small hours of Friday night\/Saturday morning local time key representatives for the European Parliament, Council and the Commission \u2014 the bloc\u2019s co-legislators \u2014 hailed the agreement as hard fought, a milestone achievement and historic, respectively.\nTaking to X to tweet the news, the EU\u2019s president, Ursula von der Leyen \u2014 who made delivering a regulation to promote \u201ctrustworthy\u201d AI a key priority of her term when she took up the post in late 2019 \u2014 also lauded the political agreement as a \u201cglobal first\u201d.\nThe \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa AI Act is a global first. A unique legal framework for the development of AI you can trust. And for the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses. A commitment we took in our political guidelines \u2013 and we delivered. I welcome today's political agreement. \u2014 Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) December 8, 2023\nProhibitions\nFull details of what\u2019s been agreed won\u2019t be entirely confirmed until a final text is compiled and made public, which may take some weeks. But a press release put out by the European Parliament confirms the deal reached with the Council includes a total prohibition on the use of AI for:\nbiometric categorisation systems that use sensitive characteristics (e.g. political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, race);\nuntargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases;\nemotion recognition in the workplace and educational institutions;\nsocial scoring based on social behaviour or personal characteristics;\nAI systems that manipulate human behaviour to circumvent their free will;\nAI used to exploit the vulnerabilities of people (due to their age, disability, social or economic situation).\nThe use of remote biometric identification technology in public places by law enforcement has not been completely banned \u2014 but the parliament said negotiators had agreed on a series of safeguards and narrow exceptions to limit use of technologies such as facial recognition. This includes a requirement for prior judicial authorisation \u2014 and with uses limited to a \u201cstrictly defined\u201d lists of crime.\nRetrospective (non-real-time) use of remote biometric ID AIs will be limited to \u201cthe targeted search of a person convicted or suspected of having committed a serious crime\u201d. While real-time use of this intrusive AI tech will be limited in time and location, and can only be used for the following purposes:\ntargeted searches of victims (abduction, trafficking, sexual exploitation),\nprevention of a specific and present terrorist threat, or\nthe localisation or identification of a person suspected of having committed one of the specific crimes mentioned in the regulation (e.g. terrorism, trafficking, sexual exploitation, murder, kidnapping, rape, armed robbery, participation in a criminal organisation, environmental crime).\nThe Council\u2019s press release on the deal emphasizes that the provisional agreement \u201cclarifies that the regulation does not apply to areas outside the scope of EU law and should not, in any case, affect member states\u2019 competences in national security or any entity entrusted with tasks in this area\u201d. It also confirms the AI act will not apply to systems exclusively for military or defence purposes.\n\u201cSimilarly, the agreement provides that the regulation would not apply to AI systems used for the sole purpose of research and innovation, or for people using AI for non-professional reasons,\u201d the Council added.\nCivil society groups have reacted sceptically \u2014 raising concerns the agreed limitations on state agencies\u2019 use of biometric identification technologies will not go far enough to safeguard human rights. Digital rights group EDRi, which was among those pushing for a full ban on remote biometrics, said that whilst the deal contains \u201csome limited gains for human rights\u201d, it looks like \u201ca shell of the AI law Europe really needs\u201d.\nReal-time public facial recognition (RBI): disappointingly, but not surprisingly, member states resisted a full ban. The Parliament fought hard to narrow exceptions and add more safeguards, but it doesn't look like it will be enough to stop widespread biometric mass surveillance; \u2014 Ella Jakubowska (@ellajakubowska1) December 9, 2023\nRules for \u2018high risk\u2019 AIs, and general purpose AIs\nThe package agreed also includes obligations for AI systems that are classified as \u201chigh risk\u201d owing to having \u201csignificant potential harm to health, safety, fundamental rights, environment, democracy and the rule of law\u201d.\n\u201cMEPs successfully managed to include a mandatory fundamental rights impact assessment, among other requirements, applicable also to the insurance and banking sectors. AI systems used to influence the outcome of elections and voter behaviour, are also classified as high-risk,\u201d the parliament wrote. \u201cCitizens will have a right to launch complaints about AI systems and receive explanations about decisions based on high-risk AI systems that impact their rights.\u201d\nThere was also agreement on a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system of guardrails to be applied to \u201cgeneral\u201d AI systems, such as the so-called foundational models underpinning the viral boom in generative AI applications like ChatGPT.\nAs we reported earlier, the deal reached on foundational models\/general purpose AIs (GPAIs) includes some transparency requirements for what co-legislators referred to as \u201clow tier\u201d AIs \u2014 meaning model makers must draw up technical documentation and produce (and publish) detailed summaries about the content used for training in order to support compliance with EU copyright law. For \u201chigh-impact\u201d GPAIs (defined as the cumulative amount of compute used for their training measured in floating point operations is greater than 10^25) with so-called \u201csystemic risk\u201d there are more stringent obligations.\n\u201cIf these models meet certain criteria they will have to conduct model evaluations, assess and mitigate systemic risks, conduct adversarial testing, report to the Commission on serious incidents, ensure cybersecurity and report on their energy efficiency,\u201d the parliament wrote. \u201cMEPs also insisted that, until harmonised EU standards are published, GPAIs with systemic risk may rely on codes of practice to comply with the regulation.\u201d\nThe Commission has been working with industry on a stop-gap AI Pact for some months \u2014 and it confirmed today this is intended to plug the practice gap until the AI Act comes into force.\nWhile foundational models\/GPAIs that have been commercialized face regulation under the Act, R&D is not intended to be in scope of the law \u2014 and fully open sourced models will have lighter regulatory requirements than closed source, per today\u2019s pronouncements.\nThe package agreed also promotes regulatory sandboxes and real-world-testing being established by national authorities to support startups and SMEs to develop and train AIs before placement on the market.\nPenalties and entry into force\nPenalties for non-compliance can lead to fines ranging from \u20ac35 million or 7% of global turnover to \u20ac7.5 million or 1.5 % of turnover, depending on the infringement and size of the company, per the parliament.\nThe Council\u2019s PR further stipulates that the higher sanction (7%) would apply for violations of the banned AI applications, while penalties of 1.5% would be levied for the supply of incorrect information. Additionally, it says sanctions of 3% could be imposed for violations of other AI Act obligations but also notes that the provisional agreement allows for \u201cmore proportionate caps\u201d on administrative fines for SMEs and start-ups in case of infringements. So there looks to be some scope for AI startups to face smaller penalties for infringements than AI giants may invite.\nThe deal agreed today also allows for a phased entry into force after the law is adopted \u2014 with six months allowed until rules on prohibited use cases kick in; 12 months for transparency and governance requirements; and 24 months for all other requirements. So the full force of the EU\u2019s AI Act may not be felt until 2026.\nCarme Artigas, Spain\u2019s secretary of state for digital and AI issues, who led the Council\u2019s negotiations on the file as the country has held the rotating Council presidency since the summer, hailed the agreement on the heavily contested file as \u201cthe biggest milestone in the history of digital information in Europe\u201d; both for the bloc\u2019s single digital market \u2014 but also, she suggested, \u201cfor the world\u201d.\n\u201cWe have achieved the first international regulation for artificial intelligence in the world,\u201d she announced during a post-midnight press conference to confirm the political agreement, adding: \u201cWe feel very proud.\u201d\nThe law will support European developers, startups and future scale-ups by giving them \u201clegal certainty with technical certainty\u201d, she predicted.\nSpeaking on behalf of the European Parliament, co-rapporteurs Drago\u0219 Tudorache and Brando Benifei said their objective had been to deliver AI legislation that would ensure the ecosystem developed with a \u201chuman centric approach\u201d which respects fundamental rights and European values.\nTheir assessment of the outcome was equally upbeat \u2014 citing the inclusion in the agreed text of a total ban on the use of AI for predictive policing and for biometric categorization as major wins.\n\u201cFinally we got in the right track, defending fundamental rights to the necessity that is there for our democracies to endure such incredible changes,\u201d said Benifei, who just a few weeks ago was sounding doubtful a deal could be found. \u201cWe are the first ones in the world to have a horizontal legislation that has this direction on fundamental rights, that supports the development of AI in our continent, and that is up to date to the frontier of the artificial intelligence with the most powerful models under clear obligation. So I think we delivered.\u201d\n\u201cWe have always been questioned whether there is enough protection, whether there is enough stimulant for innovation in this text, and I can say, this balance is there,\u201d added Tudorache. \u201cWe have safeguards, we have all the provisions that we need, the redress that we need in giving trust to our citizens in the interaction with AI, in the products in the services that they will interact with from now on.\n\u201cWe now have to use this blueprint to seek now global convergence because this is a global challenge for everyone. And I think that with the work that we\u2019ve done, as difficult as it was \u2014 and it was difficult, this was a marathon negotiation by all standards, looking at all precedents so far \u2014 but I think we delivered.\u201d\nThe EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, also chipped in with his two euro-cents \u2014 describing the agreement clinched a little before midnight Brussels\u2019 time as \u201chistoric\u201d. \u201cIt is a full package. It is a complete deal. And this is why we spent so much time,\u201d he intoned. \u201cThis is balancing user safety, innovation for startups, while also respecting\u2026 our fundamental rights and our European values.\u201d\nClear road ahead?\nDespite the EU very visibly patting itself on the back tonight on securing a deal on \u2018world-first\u2019 AI rules, it\u2019s not quite yet the end of the road for the bloc\u2019s lawmaking process as there are still some formal steps to go \u2014 not least the final text will face votes in the parliament and the Council to adopt it. But given how much division and disagreement there has been over how (or even whether) to regulate AI the biggest obstacles have been dismantled with this political deal and the path to passing the EU AI Act in the coming months looks clear.\nThe Commission is certainly projecting confidence. Per Breton, work to implement the agreement starts immediately with the set up of an AI Office within the EU\u2019s executive \u2014 which will have the job of coordinating with the Member State oversight bodies that will need to enforce the rules on AI firms; and overseeing the most advanced AI models, including by contributing to fostering standards and testing practices. A scientific panel of independent experts will be appointed to advise the AI Office about GPAI models. \u201cWe will welcome new colleagues\u2026 a lot of them,\u201d said Breton. \u201cWe will work \u2014 starting tomorrow \u2014 to get ready.\u201d\nOpposition to the inclusion in the AI package of tiered rules for general purpose AIs has been led, in recent weeks, by France \u2014 and French AI startup Mistral, which had been lobbying for a total carve out from obligations for foundational models\/GPAIs. In the event the deal agreed by the Spanish presidency does contain some obligations for GPAIs and foundation models. So it\u2019s not the total carve out Mistral and its lobbyists have been pushing for.\nResponding to news of the political deal last night, France\u2019s digital minister\u2019s office put out a statement attributed to Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot which said (translated from French using AI): \u201cWe will be carefully analyzing the compromise reached today, and in the coming weeks we will ensure that the text preserves Europe\u2019s ability to develop its own artificial intelligence technologies, and safeguards its strategic autonomy.\u201d\nIt remains unclear how much of a carve out Mistral\u2019s business might enjoy under the deal agreed. Asked about this during the press conference, Artigas suggested the French AI startup would \u2014 once commercialized \u2014 be likely to fit in the \u201clow tier\u201d for GPAIs, meaning it would have only limited transparency obligations, since she said it does not hit the high capacity compute threshold triggering the systemic risk obligations (as she said it\u2019s using what\u2019s thought to be 10^23 of compute, not 10^25).\nHowever, as Mistral is currently still in an R&D and pre-training phase for their models, she said they would be excluded from even the low tier compliance requirements.\nThis report was updated to include the response from the French digital ministry; link to the Council\u2019s PR; and with additional details from the presser \u2014 including remarks about how the law might apply to Mistral. We also added details on civil society\u2019s response\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-09 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":564}
{"title":"Mysterious dog respiratory illness: What to know","context":"## Mysterious dog respiratory illness: What to know\n\nThe mysterious respiratory illness that may have sickened scores of dogs across the country could be caused by a new type of bacterial infection that may be very good at evading the canine immune system, researchers say. Some dogs have died from the illness, which starts with causes a cough that can last for weeks, runny eyes and sneezing.\nIn a development that might help shed light on the illness, which has affected a variety of dog breeds, researchers at the University of New Hampshire\u2019s Veterinary Diagnosis Laboratory and the Hubbard Center for Genome Studies told NBC News they have identified a pathogen that might be what\u2019s making pets sick.\nThrough a genetic sequencing of samples from an initial group of 30 dogs from New Hampshire who were infected last year and then an additional 40 from Rhode Island and Massachusetts who got sick this year, the researchers say they have discovered a previously unknown germ.\nThe pathogen is \u201ca funky bacterium,\u201d said Dr. David Needle, pathology section chief at the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller than a normal bacterium in its size and in the size of its genome. Long story short, it\u2019s a weird bacterium that can be tough to find and sequence.\u201d\nThe germ \u201cis new as a potential cause of disease, but it is likely to be\u2014 or to have evolved from \u2014 a component of the dog microbiome,\u201d he said. Dogs as well as humans have multiple types of harmless bacteria and other microorganisms living both inside and outside the body. In the gut, they are thought to aid in digestion.\nThe bacterium was discovered after a painstaking search.\n\u201cAfter initial sequencing showed there were no known viral, bacterial or fungal pathogens, time consuming and dogged work by graduate student Lawrence Gordon showed that 21 of the initial 30 samples from New Hampshire had some genetic material from one atypical bacterial species,\u201d Needle said.\nThe UNH team is sharing its results prior to publishing a research article, hoping they will give veterinarians some information as they deal with other respiratory syndrome outbreaks, he said.\nScientists aren\u2019t even sure yet whether the same bug is making dogs sick across the nation. Many researchers have wondered whether it was a bacterial or a viral pathogen. One thing veterinarians do know is that the germ is something they don\u2019t recognize.\nMike Stepien, a spokesperson for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), said in an email Wednesday the agency is working with multiple state animal health officials and diagnostic labs regarding the respiratory illness in dogs that, \"in rare cases, has progressed rapidly to death.\"\n\"APHIS and partners have not yet definitively identified the cause of illness,\" Stepien responded in an email. \"There are no reports of human illness affiliated with these cases at this time.\"\nNew Hampshire is one of a handful of states that have reported cases of the respiratory infection in dogs.\nThe Oregon Agriculture Department has received more than 200 case reports from veterinarians around the state since the beginning of August, spokesperson Andrea Cantu-Schomus said in an email. A very small percentage of the dogs have died, Cantu-Schomus said.\nOther states with possible cases include:\nIn conversations with veterinarians, Dr. Karl E. Jandrey, a professor of clinical small animal emergency and critical care at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, has heard of potential cases in North Carolina, Rhode Island and Virginia, as well.\nBecause there is no test yet for the illness and because many of the symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections, such as canine influenza and Bordetella (kennel cough), it\u2019s unknown exactly how many dogs have been affected. With hundreds of cases identified by symptoms reported only in Oregon, it\u2019s likely there are thousands.\nNormally, to determine what antibiotics might work best against a particular type of bacteria, labs grow the bugs in a petri dish and then try to kill them with various medications. Needle and his colleagues have not been able to grow the new bacteria in the lab. Nevertheless, its structure offers some clues about which medications might be the best choice to fight it, he said. The antibiotic doxycycline may be effective, he suggested.\nIf it turns out that the New Hampshire researchers have found the right microbe, that may explain why some dogs are getting very sick, said Jandrey.\nSmaller pathogens are likely to have an easier time making it past a dog\u2019s defenses in the upper respiratory tract and getting down into the lungs, he said. \u201cIf it goes into the lungs, there\u2019s a risk of pneumonia,\u201d he added.\nWhat are the dog infection symptoms?\nAccording to Oregon\u2019s Cantu-Schomus, the dogs\u2019 illnesses largely develop in three ways:\nAs an inflammation of the tubes that connect the throat to the lungs that is minimally or not responsive to antibiotics.\nAs chronic pneumonia that is minimally or not responsive to antibiotics.\nAs acute pneumonia that rapidly becomes severe and often leads to severe illness or possibly death in as little as 24 to 36 hours.\nIf a dog has a cough that won\u2019t quit and other respiratory symptoms, it\u2019s recommended that the owner contact a veterinarian right away.\nWhile the respiratory symptoms seem to be like a viral illness, testing has been negative for a virus, Cantu-Schomus said.\nIt\u2019s very unlikely that the cause will turn out to be viral, said Colin Parrish, a professor of virology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University. \u201cWith the sequencing methods people use to look for unknown viruses, its signature would have been clear in a few days,\u201d he added.\nSo it\u2019s possible that the New Hampshire scientists could have hit upon the right pathogen, although their results need to be confirmed by more research, he said.\nWhat owners should do\nThe American Kennel Club\u2019s chief veterinarian offered advice for both dog owners and their vets.\nFirst, owners should make sure their pets are fully vaccinated and boosted against the known canine diseases, said Dr. Jerry Klein, a practicing vet for 35 years and who was emergency department head emeritus at MedVet Chicago and currently works at the McKillip Animal Hospital in Chicago.\nKlein recommends that veterinarians suggest a full respiratory panel when people bring in sick dogs, but acknowledges that may be an expense some owners can\u2019t afford.\nIf a dog\u2019s veterinarian doesn\u2019t suggest the panel, then owners should request it; that will help determine if the germ is one that vets already know about or is something new.\nPeople can call their local emergency vets to find out if there has been an increase in respiratory infections coming in for treatment, Klein said.\n\u201cThat would be a way to find out whether there\u2019s been an uptick in your area,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is, then they should try to protect against exposure by avoiding grooming establishments and daycare.\u201d\nKlein also recommends that groomers and daycare facilities not allow dogs to share food and water dishes.\nEven though a record number of Americans are expected to travel during the holiday season, experts recommend that dog owners keep their pets out of kennels and other areas, such as dog parks, where infection might be more likely because of crowded conditions and close contact.\n\u201cWhen you congregate a bunch of animals together, there\u2019s a larger likelihood of getting an infectious disease from other dogs,\u201d said Dr. Kurt Williams, director of the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Lab at the Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine at Oregon State University.\nStill, he said, there are some facilities where you are less likely to have a problem because of how they are designed.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been telling people to work closely with their vet,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd to make sure their dog has all the vaccines available, in particular those for respiratory diseases we are familiar with.\u201d\nAnother option is for owners to hire a house sitter, Needle said. \u201cOr hire a dog walker,\u201d he added. \u201cIt might not be perfect, but it\u2019s better than nothing. Also, you might want to consider having Thanksgiving at home.\u201d\nUltimately, your dog might be happier at home with a house sitter or a dog walker stopping by multiple times during the day than going to a kennel, Jandrey said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s best to leave them in their own environment,\u201d he added.\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com\n\nThis article was published by Yahoo News on 2023-11-21 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":565}
{"title":"Dangerous 'superbugs' are a growing threat, and antibiotics can't stop their rise. What can?","context":"## Dangerous 'superbugs' are a growing threat, and antibiotics can't stop their rise. What can?\n\nBacteria's rising resistance to antibiotics is making the drugs obsolete. Scientists are fighting back with viruses (pictured), CRISPR, designer molecules and cell-slicing enzymes.\nThe bacteria may have entered her flesh along with shrapnel from the bomb detonated in Brussels Airport in 2016. Or perhaps the microbes hitched a ride on the surgical instruments used to treat her wounds. Either way, the \"superbug\" refused to be vanquished, despite years of antibiotic treatment.\nThe woman had survived a terrorist attack but was held hostage by drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacterial strain often picked up by surgery patients in hospitals. Only by combining antibiotics with a new, experimental treatment did doctors finally rid her of the superbug .\nDevastating drug-resistant bacterial infections like this one are all too common, and they represent an ever-growing threat to global health. In 2019, antibiotic-resistant bacteria directly killed roughly 1.27 million people worldwide and contributed to an additional 3.68 million deaths. In the U.S. alone, drug-resistant bacteria and fungi together cause an estimated 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths each year.\nAnd the problem is getting worse: Seven of the 18 concerning bacteria tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are becoming more resistant to common antibiotics considered essential for maintaining public health. Meanwhile, drug companies have been slow to make new antibiotics capable of beating the microbes. Fewer than 30 antibiotics currently in the development pipeline target \"priority\" bacteria , as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), and most of those drugs are still vulnerable to resistance, just like their predecessors.\nThis table of select antibiotic-resistant bacteria demonstrates how rapidly important types of resistance developed after the approval and release of new antibiotics. (Image credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adapted by Live Science from the CDC's \"Select Germs Showing Resistance Over Time\" Fact Sheet.)\nSo some scientists are looking beyond traditional antibiotics for new weapons that won't fuel the rise of superbugs. Their emerging arsenal features viruses that kill bacteria; CRISPR; and microbe-slaying molecules. They hope that these experimental treatments, some of which have been tested in patients, will kill superbugs without promoting resistance.\n\"The vision, for me, is that we move beyond antibiotics and really just see a much broader palate of options,\" Chase Beisel, leader of the RNA synthetic biology research group at the Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research in Germany, told Live Science.\nBut until these new therapeutics are ready for prime time, the world needs to curtail its overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which experts say is speeding up the rate at which these lifesaving drugs become obsolete.\nRelated: Superbugs are on the rise. How can we prevent antibiotics from becoming obsolete?\nHow antibiotic resistance emerges and spreads\nAntibiotics either directly kill bacteria or slow their growth , leaving the immune system to finish the job. The drugs work in several ways \u2014 by preventing bacteria from building sturdy walls or making copies of their DNA , for instance. Growth-slowing antibiotics usually disrupt ribosomes, the factories in which bacterial cells make proteins.\nMany antibiotics shoot for the exact same molecular targets , and so-called broad-spectrum antibiotics' mechanisms are so universal that they work on both major classes of bacteria : gram-positive and gram-negative, which are distinguished by the makeup and thickness of their cell walls. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, in particular, pressure both harmful and helpful bacteria in the body to evolve defensive strategies that eject or disable the drugs, or else alter their targets.\nDrug-resistant bacteria can transfer their resistance to additional bacteria in several ways. (Image credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adapted by Live Science from the CDC's \"How Resistance Moves Directly Germ to Germ\" Fact Sheet.)\nBacteria can pick up such defenses through random DNA mutations, or by swapping \"resistance genes\" with other bacteria via a process called horizontal gene transfer. By making these gene transfers, bacteria can quickly spread such mutations to additional bacterial populations in the body and in the environment.\nThe misuse of antibiotics in health care, as well as in agriculture, has given bacteria endless opportunities to develop resistance, raising the chance that once-treatable infections will become life-threatening.\nRelated: New 'concerning' strain of drug-resistant gonorrhea found in U.S. for 1st time\nHarnessing viruses to fight bacteria\nOne of the proposed alternatives to antibiotics was first conceived more than a century ago, before the 1928 discovery of penicillin. Called phage therapy, it uses bacteria-infecting viruses called bacteriophages, or simply \"phages,\" which typically kill the germs by invading their cells and splitting them open from the inside.\nPhages can also pressure bacteria into giving up key tools in their drug resistance tool kits. For example, a phage called U136B can have this effect on E. coli. To infiltrate E. coli, the phage uses an efflux pump, a protein E. coli normally uses to pump antibiotics out of the cell. If the E. coli tries to change this pump to escape the phage, it reduces the bacterium's ability to pump out antibiotics.\n\"If phage therapy were used at a global scale ... it would not lead to the same problem of widespread resistance.\" Paul Turner, Yale University\nAnd unlike with antibiotics, bacteria are unlikely to gain widespread resistance to phage therapy , said Paul Turner , director of the Center for Phage Biology and Therapy at Yale University.\nTurner and other experts have concluded that, \"if phage therapy were used at a global scale, that it would not lead to the same problem of widespread resistance to it, the way that antibiotic use has led to that problem,\" he told Live Science.\nHere's why: Antibiotic resistance has been dramatically accelerated by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics , especially broad-spectrum antibiotics that work on a variety of bacteria. Phages, by contrast, can have much narrower targets than even narrow-spectrum antibiotics \u2014 for instance, targeting a protein found in only one or a few strains within one bacterial species.\nRelated: New drugs could stymie superbugs by freezing evolution\nThe target bacterium can still evolve resistance to an individual phage \u2014 but by picking the right combination of phages, scientists can make it so that the bacterium's evolution comes at a cost, Turner said. This cost might be a decrease in virulence or an increased vulnerability to antibiotics.\n(Image credit: Graphic made by Olha Pohrebniak via Getty Images. Adapted by Live Science.)\nTo date, phage therapy has mostly been tested through a regulatory framework known as \"compassionate use\" in patients like the Brussels Airport bombing victim, whose infections had no other treatment options. Phage therapy has shown success in these settings, and in a recent observational study of 100 patients who received phages alongside antibiotics.\nSo far in clinical trials, though, phage therapy generally hasn't worked better than standard antibiotics or a placebo. Topline results from two recent trials hint at the treatment's effectiveness in specific lung and foot infections, but the full results have yet to be released.\nSuccess in future trials will be key to getting phages into the clinic, Turner said. Those trials will have to show the therapy works for multiple types of infections, determine dosage and confirm phage therapies don't hurt helpful bacteria in the body, he added.\nTurning bacteria's defenses against them\nThe CRISPR-Cas system can be used to snip DNA at precise locations. Here, a Cas enzyme (dark pink) is preparing to cut through a target DNA strand (blue) and is being told where to cut by an RNA strand (yellow). (Image credit: Meletios Verras via Getty Images)\nAlthough made famous as a powerful gene-editing tool, CRISPR technology was actually adapted from an immune system found in many bacteria: CRISPR-Cas.\nThe key components of this immune system include molecular scissors, known as Cas proteins, and a memory bank of DNA snippets that a bacterium has collected from phages that once infected it. By tapping its memory bank, CRISPR-Cas can guide its lethal scissors to a precise point in an invading phage's DNA and snip it like a piece of ribbon.\n\"The CRISPR machinery gets into a set of cells, but only those that have the sequence or sequences you picked will be attacked and killed.\" Chase Beisel, HIRI\nOn occasion, though, rather than attacking phages, CRISPR-Cas can accidentally go after the bacterial cell's own DNA , triggering a lethal autoimmune reaction. This phenomenon inspired Beisel and his colleagues to explore using CRISPR-Cas to shred bacterial cells' DNA.\n\"The real draw of it is that it is a sequence-specific tool,\" meaning it targets only the DNA you tell it to, and not sequences present in other bacteria, Beisel told Live Science. So, once administered to a patient, \"the CRISPR machinery gets into a set of cells, but only those that have the sequence or sequences you picked will be attacked and killed.\"\nHow do you get CRISPR-Cas into the right bacteria? Various research groups are testing different delivery methods, but at present, the best strategy seems to be loading CRISPR machinery into a phage that infects the target bacterium, Beisel said.\nRelated: Scientists invent 'shape-shifting' antibiotic to fight deadly superbugs\nBeisel is a co-founder and scientific adviser of Locus Biosciences, a biotech company that's currently testing a CRISPR-enhanced phage therapy in a midstage, roughly 800-person trial. This approach couples the bacteria-killing prowess of phages with the ability of CRISPR-Cas to destroy essential bacterial genes. As with CRISPR-less phage therapies, clinical trials are needed to determine the treatment's safety profile and appropriate dosing.\n\"I can see these [treatments] coming about in the five- to 10-year time frame,\" Beisel said.\nDesigner molecules to kill bacteria\nBeyond phages and CRISPR, scientists are developing antibiotic alternatives that harness bacteria-slaying peptides \u2014 short chains of protein building blocks\u2014 and enzymes, specialized proteins that jump-start chemical reactions. These molecules differ from antibiotics because they can kill a very narrow range of bacteria by targeting bacterial proteins that cannot easily gain resistance to their attacks.\nLab-made molecules called peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are some of the most promising candidates. These engineered molecules can be designed to block bacterial cells from building essential proteins that are crucial to their survival. PNAs do this by latching onto specific mRNA, genetic molecules that carry the instructions for building proteins from the cell's control center to its protein construction sites. PNAs cannot enter bacterial cells on their own, though, so they're typically attached to other peptides that easily pass through the bacterial cell wall.\nBy targeting proteins that cells cannot change without harming themselves, PNAs can avoid triggering drug resistance, Beisel explained. The engineered molecules could also be made to target proteins that directly contribute to antibiotic resistance, for example, the efflux pumps used to push antibiotics out of cells or the enzymes capable of disabling the drugs. By emptying a germ's drug resistance tool kit, PNAs can then make it vulnerable to standard treatments.\nOne approach for killing bacteria is to use lysins, or enzymes that tear open bacterial cell membranes and cause the microbes' contents to spill out. (Image credit: KATERYNA KON\/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)\nAntibacterial PNAs are still being tested in lab dishes and animals and have not yet moved into human trials. And, scientists need to make sure PNA-based treatments don't inadvertently mess with human cells or helpful bacteria.\nRelated: 'Death screams' of swarming bacteria help their comrades survive antibiotic attacks\nIn addition to peptides like PNAs, enzymes called lysins are another promising treatment option. Lysins are used in nature by phages to split bacteria open from the inside. They act like tiny swords that slice through the outer wall of a bacterial cell, spilling its guts. The molecular sabers are unlikely to promote resistance because bacteria cannot easily change the essential cell-wall components that lysins target.\nLysins slaughter bacteria quickly upon contact, and they can be very specific, killing some types of bacteria while sparing others. Furthermore, lysins can be tweaked in the lab to change which bacteria they target, boost their potency and improve their durability in the body.\nSome lysins have entered mid- and late-stage human trials with hundreds of participants, in which they've been tested as supplementary treatments to antibiotics but garnered mixed results.\nAntibiotic stewardship can save lives, in the meantime\nUntil these next-gen bacteria slayers make it to market, immediate measures must be taken to stall the rise of superbugs, by preventing the misuse of antibiotics that pressures bacteria to evolve resistance in the first place.\n\"By reducing individual risk, you anticipate that you will drop the overall population-level risk.\" Dr. Shruti Gohil, INSPIRE-ASP Trials\nFor example, doctors can be more diligent about confirming that bacteria, not viruses, are behind a patient's infection before prescribing antibiotics, said Dr. Shruti Gohil , a lead investigator of four INSPIRE-ASP Trials , federally funded research aimed at improving hospitals' antibiotic use. Other safeguards can include auditing doctors' prescriptions to see if narrower-spectrum drugs could be used instead of broad ones, or requiring special clearance for the broadest-spectrum drugs. These steps are essential not only in hospitals but everywhere antibiotics are prescribed, from primary care to dentistry, Gohil said.\nEach interaction between a doctor and their patient matters.\nGohil stressed that \"by reducing individual risk, you anticipate that you will drop the overall population-level risk,\" and eventually slash the prevalence of multidrug-resistant bugs.\n\nThis article was published by Live Science: The Most Interesting Articles on 2023-10-01 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":566}

Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nAmazon's October Prime Day sale officially ended on Wednesday, but a few of the deals are still live as we head into the weekend. If you were hoping to check off a few more names from your holiday gift list or buy something for yourself at a discount, see what remains on sale below. We combed through our coverage over the past few days to find the best of what's left. While Amazon has returned most of their own devices, like Echos and Kindles, back to their full prices, a handful of products from other brands like Google, Samsung and Anker, have maintained the lows they hit on Prime Day. Here are the best deals from Prime Big Deal Days that you can still get right now.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\nThe new Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 went down to $269 for October Prime Day and it's still on sale. That's lowest price we've seen since it came out a few months ago. You can't get a better smartwatch than this one if you have an Android phone (bonus points if you have a Samsung phone), and it's smaller and lighter than previous versions. Samsung brought back the spinning bezel on the Classic version, which is which makes the software's UI easier to navigate, plus it has improved performance and updated health and fitness tracking tools.\nApple MacBook Air M2 (15-inch)\nPhoto by Nathan Ingraham \/ Engadget Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M2) $1,049 $1,260 Save $211 The MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and this deal brings the entry-level 15-inch model back down to the best price we've seen. Other SKUs with more RAM and storage are also on sale. $1,049 at Amazon\nThe 15.3-inch version of Apple\u2019s MacBook Air is still down to $1,049 for an entry-level model with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. That matches the best price we\u2019ve seen and takes $250 off Apple\u2019s list price. The MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and we gave the 15-inch model a review score of 96 earlier this year, as it covers just about all of the things we look for in a quality mainstream notebook. Compared to the 13.6-inch version, it also includes a more powerful speaker system and a slightly upgraded GPU. The SSD in this base configuration is technically slower than the one in higher-capacity SKUs, but that shouldn\u2019t be a major problem unless you\u2019re looking to do more complex work. In general, you wouldn\u2019t buy the Air for things like high-res media editing, though its M2 chip is still plenty powerful for everyday tasks.\nIf you do need more storage space, the 512GB model with 8GB of RAM is on sale for a low of $1,249. Variants with double the RAM are up to $250 off as well. Meanwhile, the 13.6-inch MacBook Air isn\u2019t discounted on Amazon, but it\u2019s down to $899 at Best Buy. That\u2019s $200 off the notebook\u2019s list price.\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony's WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds went down to $278 for Prime Day and are still going for that price today. That's a $22 discount and their best price yet. We think these are the best wireless earbuds on the market right now. Sony improved upon it's already remarkable buds with a more comfortable fit, better sound quality and features likes adaptive sound and Speak-to-Chat.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K\nThe previous generation of Fire TV Stick 4K dropped to $23 for the sale and is one of the few Amazon devices still on sale. It has the same processor, RAM and storage as the standard Fire TV Stick, but it can stream 4K HDR content in all its glory. It also supports Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos, while a picture-in-picture live view feature can show you feeds from compatible security cameras right on your TV screen.\nDo note, though, that this is the previous model of the streaming stick. The newly refreshed Fire TV Stick 4K isn't sale but has a faster processor and supports Wi-Fi 6.\nAnker Soundcore Motion +\nOne of the top Bluetooth options in our speaker guide is Anker\u2019s Soundcore Motion +, which gives out good sound for its price point. The $100 MSRP is discounted to $70 if you clip the on-page copuon. That's a 30 percent discount and an all-time low. It has a bright and bassy output and offers EQ customization in the app. Plus it\u2019s water-resistant, so you can take it to the park or on a hike and share your good taste in music with whoever is nearby.\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2\nThe top budget pick in our gaming headphones buying guide, the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2, is on sale for $36. That\u2019s a dollar more than it went for on Prime Day and only a modest $4 discount over its street price recently, but it's still close to lowest price we\u2019ve seen. The Cloud Stinger 2 doesn\u2019t have the most balanced or detailed sound, but its V-shaped signature gives action scenes a nice level of impact, and its mic quality belies the dirt-cheap price. The design is comfortable too, though it\u2019s made from cheap-feeling plastic.\nShokz OpenRun Pro\nThe Shokz OpenRun Pro is down to $125 for Prime Big Deal Days, which is $25 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked but still $55 below its usual going rate. This is a recommended pair of bone conduction headphones, which means it hugs the side of your head and delivers sound by passing vibrations through your skull. (It\u2019s not as uncomfortable as it sounds.) The main benefit is that this leaves your ear canals completely open, so you can enjoy a playlist or podcast without being shut out from the outside world. The downside, usually, is that you don\u2019t get as full a sound as you would with a traditional pair. That\u2019ll still be the case here, but we\u2019ve found the OpenRun Pro to deliver more low-end depth than most of its peers. They\u2019re fairly comfy and get up to 10 hours of battery life beyond that.\nLogitech G535\nIf you\u2019re looking for a wireless headset, the Logitech G535 is back down to $80, which is about $25 below its average street price. This is an honorable mention in our gaming headsets guide, as we like its lightweight design, Bluetooth support and agreeable, relatively well-balanced sound. It forces you to crank the volume to reach a listenable level though, and its mic makes voices sound a little too thin. It also doesn't work with Xbox consoles. But if you really want a wireless gaming headset for less than $100, it\u2019s well worth a look.\nSamsung Smart Monitor M8\nThe Samsung Smart Monitor M8 is down to just $500, which is $200 off its starting price (though it regularly sells for $600) and the lowest price we've seen thus far. This 32-inch display has built-in apps and allows you to access streaming services, just like you would on a smart TV. It can also act as a smart home hub, showing you your smart camera feeds and more. This discounted model is the updated 2023 version of the monitor that launched at CES 2022.\nGoogle Indoor Nest Security Cam\nA slew of Google Nest home security devices are still on sale the day after Prime, including the battery-powered Nest Cam that can go inside or outside your home. Typically priced at $180, the security cam dipped down to $120 for Amazon's October Prime Day event. The Nest Cam works with smart speakers and displays enabled with Alexa or the Google Assistant and can last up to seven months depending on how much activity it picks up. Its weather-resistant build and magnetic mount should make it easy to install on most surfaces. It sends live alerts to your phone and will even allow for on-demand check-ins without a subscription, though it only stores the last three hours for free. For six months of stored footage, you'll need a Nest Aware membership.\nGoogle Nest Thermostat\nGoogle Google Nest Thermostat $90 $130 Save $40 The Google Nest Thermostat lets you control your heating and cooling from anywhere and suggests tweaks to help you save money. This Black Friday deal takes $40 off the list price. $90 at Amazon\nIn other Google deals, the Nest Thermostat is on sale for just $90, which is only about $10 more than the lowest price we've tracked and $40 off Google's MSRP. This is Google's entry-level smart thermostat, but it still lets you control your heating and cooling from anywhere, suggests tweaks to help you save money, and in some cases, can entitle you to rebates from your utility provider. It's all relatively easy to program, and it works with Google's Nest Hub and other smart displays like the Echo Show.\nBeats Studio Pro\nThe Beats Studio Pro headphones are on sale for $180 right now. which is a dollar more than they sold for on Prime Day and still a sizable $170 discount. We reviewed these back in July when they came out and gave them a decent review score of 81. Unfortunately they didn't push any of the top picks from our our best headphones list off their pedestals. They aren't bad, however, offering pleasant, even-handed sound and good noise cancellation. Though Beats is now owned by Apple, these headphones still play nice with Android. There's no wear detection and the mostly plastic design isn\u2019t super premium, but at this price, you may not care.\nTribit StormBox Micro 2\nThe Tribit StormBox Micro 2 is another small speaker we like that puts out decent volume for its size, and for Prime day it went down to $48, which is $12 off its usual going rate. Right now it's on sale for $60, but an on-page 15 percent coupon brings it back to that Prime Day low. This device has a strap on its back that works well on belts, backpacks, or even bike handlebars, so it\u2019s easy to take on the road. And \"on the go\" is where the StormBox Micro 2 performs best, as it\u2019s more about portable volume than pure fidelity.\nGoogle Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E\nThe Google Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E is holding strong at $300 right now for a pack of three routers. That's within a dollar of the lowest price it's sold for on Amazon. It's one of the best Wi-Fi 6 router systems you can get at the moment thanks to its easy setup process, convenient Google Assistant integrations and Matter and Thread support. If you're looking for a not-too expensive way to upgrade your home Wi-Fi system, and one that will take little time to set up, Google's is the one to get.\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K\nOur favorite streaming stick, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K, remains at $37 after the sale. It packs a ton of features into an affordable package, including 4K HDR streaming capabilities, Dolby Vision, AirPlay 2 and private listening when you have a pair of headphones. And since it's so small, it makes for a great travel entertainment device too.\nHisense U6K\nThe Hisense U6K is one of the more affordable TVs. And the 55- and 65-inch models are still down to $400 and $548, respectively. We\u2019ve seen these deals before, but each matches an all-time low. The U6K is has received generally positive reviews around the web, as it's one of the few budget-level sets with quantum dots, full-array local dimming and a mini-LED backlight. All of that should help it deliver better contrast and color volume than most TVs in its price range. It\u2019s not ideal for gaming though, as it\u2019s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate and lacks HDMI 2.1 ports. In general, it can\u2019t match the brightness or viewing angles of a more expensive set, but it looks to be a good buy if you\u2019re on a tighter budget.\nFor a well-reviewed midrange model, the Hisense U8K provides much better contrast and peak brightness, plus more gaming-friendly features like ability to play 4K content at up to a 144Hz refresh rate. That one is down to $748 for a 55-inch model and $998 for a 65-inch set.\niRobot Roomba 694\niRobot's Roomba 694 dropped to $199 for Prime Day and stayed there. While that's still $20 more than the lowest we've seen it go, it's still a good deal on our favorite cheap robot vacuum. It's got strong suction power, an attractive design and easy to use app. It'll be a good option for robo-vac novices, or anyone that doesn't want to fuss too much with an automatic dirt sucker. It clears hard and carpeted floors well, and it automatically returns to its base once a cleaning job is finished so it can recharge.\nSamsung Pro Plus microSD\nThe Samsung Pro Plus microSD card is on sale for $20 right now. It's our top pick in our best microSD card guide because it was the most consistent of the ones we tested, with some of the best overall speeds and all of the important ratings that a good card should have: U3, V30 and A2. It'll be a great pick for your tablet, smartphone or Nintendo Switch, and it comes with a full-sized adapter in case you need to use it with a camera or connect it to your computer.\nCrucial MX500\nThe Crucial MX500 internal drive is on sale for $46 right now. It's been an Engadget favorite for a while thanks to its sequential read speeds of 560MB\/s and a standard 2.5-inch design that should make it easy to swap in for your desktop's or laptop's used-up drive.\nOther great deals for after Prime Day\nAnker 511 Charger\nAnker 511 Charger (Nano 3) $20 $23 Save $3 See at Amazon\nNew Apple Watches don\u2019t come with power adapters, so if you\u2019re looking for one that can deliver a quick charge, we recommend Anker's 511 (Nano 3) charging brick. It\u2019s down to $20 which is a mild, $4 discount, but still a welcome price for a worthwhile smartwatch accessory.\nOtterBox Fast Charge Power Bank\nOtterBox Fast Charge Power Bank 15,000 mAh $36 $45 Save $9 See at Amazon\nThe OtterBox Fast Charge Power Bank is currently just $36 for the 15,000mAh capacity model, which is the version we tested and recommend in our portable battery guide. This pack looks sharp and delivers a fast and reliable charge via USB-C or USB-A.\nSanDisk 128GB microSDXC Card for Nintendo Switch\nSanDisk 128GB microSDXC-Card Licensed for Nintendo-Switch $18 $31 Save $13 See at Amazon\nIf you need more room on your Switch, SanDisk's officially licensed microSDXC card is a good pick, particularly when it\u2019s on sale. Right now a 128GB model is within a dollar of its all-time low at just $18.\nSamsung Pro Plus microSD card\nSamsung Pro Plus microSD Memory Card + Reader $23 $38 Save $15 See at Amazon\nOur favorite microSD card for most people is the Samsung Pro Plus. It had the fastest sequential write speeds and random performance of any card we tested, and the USB reader that comes with included with this listing helps it reach higher speeds on compatible devices. It\u2019s listed at $38 for the set (though it often goes for $25), and now Prime Day in October brings it to $23.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\n\nThis article, authored by Engadget, was published by Engadget on 2023-10-12 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":567}
{"title":"Colorado vs. Arizona State live score, updates, highlights from Week 6 college football game","context":"## Colorado vs. Arizona State live score, updates, highlights from Week 6 college football game\n\nColorado fans, you're back. For now.\nA 43-yard pass from Shedeur Sanders on the Buffaloes' final drive helped set up Alejandro Mata for the game-winning 43-yard field goal with 12 seconds left, delivering Colorado the 27-24 win over Arizona State for their first Pac-12 win of the season. It snaps their eight-game conference losing streak.\nSanders had a mediocre day by his lofty standards, but his 239 yards and a touchdown were enough in perhaps Colorado's most crucial game so far. It brought the team to 4-2, but had it lost, it would have been much harder for the Buffs to finish the season bowl eligible. A win gives them a leg up in a competitive conference, particularly facing four ranked teams down the stretch of the season.\nIf Colorado wants to solidify a bowl game, it'll have to fix many things, one of them being the offensive line. It allowed five sacks on Sanders, bringing the season total to a nation-leading 31. The defense picked up five sacks themselves to maintain pressure on Trenton Bourguet.\nFor Arizona State, Bourguet put all he could into Saturday's narrow loss. He's one of two healthy quarterbacks on the roster, and passed for 335 yards and a touchdown. The Sun Devils had a real shot at their first conference win. But as the game came to a close, Bourguet seemed roughed up and slow, though he did drive the team down the field 94 yards in 13 plays for the game-tying touchdown with 50 seconds left.\nLuckily for Arizona State, next week is a bye week. What's not so lucky is that it'll go on to play three ranked teams over the following three weeks.\nWe didn't see the worst of either team, though we didn't see the best either. Colorado needed a bounce back win and got one. Meanwhile Arizona State kept on struggling, falling to 1-5.\nMORE: Watch Colorado vs. Arizona State live with Fubo (free trial)\nThe Sporting News tracked updates and highlights from college football's Week 6 game between Colorado and Arizona State.\nColorado vs. Arizona State score\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Final Colorado 7 7 0 13 27 Arizona State 7 10 0 7 24\nColorado vs. Arizona State results, highlights from Week 6 game\nFINAL: Colorado 27, Arizona State 24\nColorado 27, Arizona State 24\n10:17 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2013 Absolutely clutch.

{"title":"Faith dilemma: How effective is positive thinking when life gets difficult? Pastor weighs in","context":"## Faith dilemma: How effective is positive thinking when life gets difficult? Pastor weighs in\n\nPastor Jesse Bradley of Auburn, Washington runs Grace Community Church.\nHe's ministered to many, many people struggling with a variety of faith dilemmas and issues in their lives.\nIn this month of October 2023, as Americans grapple with a variety of issues, he addressed the notion of positive thinking \u2014 and shared with Fox News Digital what it would \"look like to change your thinking and shift in a new direction.\"\nWASHINGTON PASTOR, ONCE GRAVELY ILL, SHARES HOW \u2018THE POWER OF THE SECOND THOUGHT\u2019 TRANSFORMED HIS LIFE\nSaid Pastor Bradley, \"Psychologists report that we have in between 6,000 and 60,000 thoughts a day, based on the person and situation. The National Science Foundation shares that up to 80% of our first thoughts are not helpful, even destructive.\"\nWhat happens is that \"when life is difficult, we can become flooded with thoughts that are drenched in fear, worry, stress, selfishness, impurity, selfishness and lies. We do not have to believe, harbor or entertain negative first thoughts. We can be proactive by intentionally choosing our second thought.\"\nIt is no accident that the pastor's new book, his second, is called \"The Power of the Second Thought.\"\nIt dives into the power of understanding that the first thoughts we have are not always the best \u2014 and that it's wise to take some time and get to the \"second thoughts,\" which can yield greater understanding.\nSTORYTELLER REVEALS HIS FAITH AT WORK: \u2018I REFUSE TO TRY TO SCREW SOMEONE IN THE NAME OF BUSINESS\u2019\nSaid Bradley to Fox News Digital in emailed comments this week, \"How can we choose a positive attitude and approach during the day? Reject and replace!\"\nHe gave this list of examples:\nReplace \"People just slack and gossip at my job\" with \"I will work with all my strength, even when no one is looking\"\nReplace \"There's no hope for my future\" with \"I am thankful for today and will keep doing the next right thing\"\nReplace \"My children are annoying\" with \"My children are a gift from God\"\nReplace \"I'll never have good friendships\" with \"I will pursue and support the people that I respect the most\"\nReplace \"No one really cares about me\" with \"God is with me and loves me every day\"\nSaid Bradley, \"Johns Hopkins reports that there are links between positive thinking and health. People with a positive outlook are less likely to have a heart attack or cardiovascular event.\"\n\"I didn't have a roadmap for finding hope or the tools to handle the intensity of my loss and pain.\"\nAlso, \"Research from the University of North Carolina points to positive people being more resilient and finding more solutions to problems. A Harvard study shares that optimism reduces the risk of dying prematurely \u2014 from overcoming trauma, making the most of your opportunities to overall life satisfaction, positivity makes a difference.\"\nWASHINGTON PASTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THE PAIN OF PUTDOWNS AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN FAITH: \u2018ASK GOD FOR COURAGE\u2019\nThe pastor said he wrote his most recent book, \"The Power of the Second Thought,\" to help people gain habits to strengthen their mental health.\nBradley graduated from Dartmouth College and was playing professional soccer when he became ill \u2014 something that took 10 years to fully recover from. He said finding hope during that time was challenging but is how he changes his \"hopeless first thoughts.\"\n\"I didn't have a roadmap for finding hope or the tools to handle the intensity of my loss and pain,\" he said.\nFAITH DILEMMA IN FOCUS: \u2018IT\u2019S SUNDAY AND I HAVEN'T GONE TO CHURCH \u2014 WHAT DO I DO?'\nHe said turning to Jesus for a deeper meaning and learning to not take his \"first thoughts\" for fact was crucial to his overall mental health.\n\"The Word of God is living and active, bringing strength, courage, wisdom, and protection,\" he said.\n\"God's thoughts and ways are higher than ours, but when we spend time, each day reading His Word and listening to the voice of the Good Shepherd, we are filled with new thoughts that change the trajectory of our lives.\"\nBradley also shared his dos and don'ts of positive thinking.\nHe said it's not \"denial and pretending that there are no challenges,\" he said.\n\"Positive thinking is not flattery and frivolous compliments.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nRather, positive thinking is realistic, full of truth and love \u2014 and aligned with heaven and scripture.\n\"Positive thinking is not self-consumption, self-absorption or selfishness. Positive thinking is not creating unrealistic expectations for other people and putting extra stress on them to be perfect.\"\nBradley said, \"Positive thinking is a vital aspect of loving your neighbor, nourishing your mind, discerning between light and darkness, good and evil and right and wrong.\"\n\"Positive thinking leads to taking action and improving situations. Positive thinking brings out the best in the people around you. Positive thinking rejects excuses, takes responsibility, and overcomes setbacks.\"\nThe pastor went on to explain that Jesus brought more positivity than anyone \u2014 which is why it's important to keep faith aligned with that practice of positive thinking.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Jesus exudes a trustworthy positivity that is full of meaning, faithfulness, and transformation,\" he noted.\n\"God renews our thinking and vision, empowers us to make intentional choices about our focus and perspective and trains us how to win the battle of our minds,\" he added.\nBradley said, \"Positive thinking is relational, and there is no greater source of joy in our lives than God.\"\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Lifestyle on 2023-10-28 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":569}
{"title":"Jonathan Roumie on faith and prayer life during Advent and always: 'God hasn't forsaken us'","context":"## Jonathan Roumie on faith and prayer life during Advent and always: 'God hasn't forsaken us'\n\nIn a phone interview with Fox News Digital on Monday, Los Angeles-based actor Jonathan Roumie spoke of his Christian faith, his prayer life and his hope that others may find peace and serenity during this Advent season of 2023 \u2014 because \"any opportunity to connect to Jesus is a welcome one,\" he said.\nRoumie, perhaps best known for his role as Jesus Christ in \"The Chosen,\" has paired up with Hallow, the No. 1 prayer app in the world, for a special Advent prayer challenge for this holy season of preparation for Christmas. The 25-day prayer challenge began Monday \u2014 and as part of the effort, both he and actor Liam Neeson guide people through a variety of prayers, meditations, Bible readings and more.\nThis is no mere gig, however, for Roumie.\nHe is a committed Christian and Catholic, with his own personal story of growing closer to God and continuing to do so each day.\nHALLOW APP ANNOUNCES COLLABORATION WITH LIAM NEESON FOR NEW ADVENT SERIES THIS YEAR\nPeople can \"disconnect from the chaos of the real world, the divisiveness, the anxiety\" that exists, said Roumie, by connecting with Jesus through prayer.\nThey can find \"peace and a deeper relationship with Christ, and I think that's really the goal of the prayer challenge,\" he said.\nRoumie said that building a habit of prayer \"is easier than people think.\"\nHe added, \"As you consistently tap into that habit, you find your relationship with Jesus growing deeper and deeper, just automatically. And as a result, you then experience much more peace, tranquility and serenity in your life and the ability to really muscle through some of the most difficult obstacles and challenges that life can throw at you,\" he said.\nHere is more of Fox News Digital's conversation with Roumie about the 25-day prayer challenge during Advent, which started on Monday \u2014 and about Roumie's own faith beliefs.\n\u2018Deep gratitude\u2019\nFox News Digital: In the midst of some of the most trying times today, how do you \u2014 and how does anyone \u2014 keep a focus on prayer, on God, on a connection with God? It's very, very easy to get distracted in today's world.\nJonathan Roumie: Yes, and I think that for me, I'm very easily distracted \u2014 and technology is one of the things that contributes to that distraction.\nBut in this case, I have such a deep gratitude to the technology that's arrived in the form of this app \u2014 of the Hallow app. I can literally go to my phone and if I find myself or my mind wandering \u2014 or my anxiety building \u2014 all I have to do is literally click on the app and just start praying or meditating on one of the challenges or one of the prayers.\nFIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT IS A REMINDER TO \u2018WATCH\u2019 AND PREPARE FOR CHRIST'S SECOND COMING, SAYS FAITH LEADER\nThere are thousands of prayers on this app. And I'm instantly transported into a sacred space, no matter where I am.\nNo matter what, if you live in a major city or if you live in a place that's just really busy, you can pop on your headphones and connect to the app. You start praying with a meditation and you're instantly just transported.\nThis is something that I've been so grateful for \u2014 and especially as we go into the hubbub and the busyness of the Christmas season, it's something that I'm relying on daily, to be able to just cut through all that noise.\n\u2018Transformative for people\u2019\nQuestion: Are people reaching out to you about your involvement with the app and asking you more about it?\nRoumie: I've had so many people say they've cultivated a relationship with Jesus through prayer because they heard me talk about the app, or because they watched \"The Chosen\" and then they started seeing this pop up in other places.\nWHAT IS AN ADVENT AND WHAT DO ITS CANDLES MEAN DURING THIS HOLY SEASON?\nAnd they've gotten introduced to the app and to a more deeply cultivated prayer life \u2014 and in some cases it's been absolutely transformative for people.\nSome people who've never been to church started going to church. Some people who haven't been to church for 20 years have come back to the church. People have converted \u2014 and all because they've fallen in love with the richness, the depth and the tradition of the Catholic Church.\nAnd obviously [the Hallow app] is authentically Catholic, but it is for all Christians \u2014 Christians of all denominations. There's something there for everybody, which is what makes the app so universally appealing.\n\u2018Simple act of surrender\u2019\nQuestion: You've described an experience earlier in your life in which you prayed about leaving all of your anxieties and worries aside, and instead trusted that God would take care of things \u2014 and then after that came the role of Jesus in \"The Chosen\" for you. Is there a larger message here for people, things that others might learn from your experience?\nRoumie: I think it all comes down to the simple act of surrender to God in a person's life. And I went through this in a very visceral, substantial and transformative way in my life five years ago.\nI literally was on my knees and I said, \"Jesus, I surrender myself to you. Take care of everything.\" And He did.\n\"It's a matter of tapping into [our] faith and allowing Him to be more involved in our lives \u2014 and surrendering is the first step to getting there\"\nAnd then three months later, I got called to do \"The Chosen.\" It was a point that I think my life was building to when that happened \u2014 and I realized that trying to micromanage God was not something that was working in my favor.\n'HALLOW' PRAYER APP ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL DURING THE GOP DEBATE, COMPANY SAYS: 'PRAY WITH ME REAL QUICK'\nAnd once I let him take the wheel, everything changed. The decisive moment was that simple prayer of surrender.\nAnd I think that's really difficult for people, especially when we feel so out of control. When we turn on the news and see what's going on today, it feels like we have no control in our own lives.\nBut God hasn't forsaken us. He's not abandoned us. He's faithful to us to the very end. And it's a matter of tapping into that faith and allowing Him to be more involved in our lives \u2014 and surrendering is the first step to getting there.\nAnd then, to continue to cultivate that relationship through prayer \u2014 that's how we sustain that surrender.\nThe Hallow app and especially this Advent challenge is a beautiful way to kickstart that, especially if a person hasn't ever tried praying consistently before.\n\u2018So many options\u2019\nQuestion: For those who haven't used it yet, can you describe how the app is not a replacement for Scripture but actually offers robust access to the Bible?\nRoumie: I narrate most of the New Testament in the app, so you have access to the Bible here, through many works and passages of Scripture and through [other people] as well.\nAnd if you want something that's very specific, it is here. Plus, there are resources for mental health.\nThere is music.\nAnd for me as a musician, music is so transportive and nourishing for the spirit \u2014 to be able to listen to music that kind of gets you in the mindset for prayer and worship.\nThere are just so many options that people have that it's kind of mind-bending.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nQuestion: How has playing the role of Jesus in \"The Chosen\" changed your life and changed you?\nRoumie: It's allowed me to go deeper into my own relationship with Him.\nIt's caused me to examine what exactly is my relationship with Him \u2014 and how can I go further in that relationship, how can I get close to Him, how can I grow deeper in communion with Him.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSo it's challenged me on that level.\nBut as it challenges me, it also allows me to go further in that relationship \u2014 and to deepen my prayer life.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Lifestyle on 2023-12-05 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":570}
{"title":"Ten Hag responds to Carra: Man Utd have actually improved","context":"## Ten Hag responds to Carra: Man Utd have actually improved\n\nErik ten Hag has disagreed with Jamie Carragher's comments that Manchester United are going backwards this season - by saying the statistics show that his team has actually improved.\nUnited host local rivals Manchester City in a Super Sunday derby this weekend, live on Sky Sports with kick-off at 3.30pm, in the latest acid test to see how far Ten Hag's side have improved from last season.\nIn his column in The Daily Telegraph, Carragher said United's summer signings have led to the club becoming \"stale\" - and that Ten Hag should now be questioned about whether he can get the best out of his squad.\nBut in his pre-match press conference for the City game, Ten Hag hit back at those claims.\n\"In possession we have to do better, but there are reasons and I don't go into them, but everyone is seeing why. But there are also facts so I disagree [with Carragher], we are much better,\" said Ten Hag.\n\"In high ball regains, we are a top of the Premier League. In the middle [of the pitch] ball regains, we are top. The pressing is very good. So that's not the truth, what he [Carragher] is telling.\"\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player FREE TO WATCH: Highlights from Sheffield United\u2019s Premier League clash with Manchester United\nIn a fortnight where United have picked up three straight wins against Brentford, Sheffield United and FC Copenhagen, albeit via far from convincing performances, Christian Eriksen said United still need to find their \"balance and routines\" this season.\nAsked about those comments, Ten Hag said: \"We are in the right direction. We have a way to go. I see positives but I see negatives.\n\"What Christian is referring to is we are not consistently in possession on the level where we can be. Like Arsenal away, the first 30 minutes in Bayern Munich away. We should do this on a consistent basis.\n\"We don't take the benefit in the attacking transition moments, we should be because the ability in the team can take benefit from it. We pay attention to it, we need to grow. Then games will become easier.\"\nSo, what do the stats say?\nSky Sports' Sam Blitz:\nTen Hag is indeed right - Manchester United do rank very highly in their pressing stats in the final two-thirds of the pitch.\nUnited are, as he says, \"top of the Premier League\" in terms of possessions won in the final third and high turnovers. He is slightly wrong in terms of winning the ball in the middle third of the pitch - with United second behind Everton in that statistical table.\nHowever, there is still work to be done in terms of improving United's pressing. Their passing permitted per defensive actions (PPDA) tally ranks 10th - so, average - in the league. It shows that while Ten Hag's side do win the ball high up the pitch, opponents do tend to keep the ball as well as play it around United's pressing forwards as well.\nWhat is PPDA? PPDA is the number of opposition passes allowed outside of the pressing team's own defensive third, divided by the number of defensive actions by the pressing team outside of their own defensive third. A lower figure indicates a higher level of pressing, while a higher figure indicates a lower level of pressing.\nThe other pressing concern United have, which Ten Hag did reference in Friday's press conference, is finishing chances when they win the ball high up.\nUnited have the fourth-highest amounts of shots after winning the ball in their final third, but the glaring statistic is no goals from 104 high turnovers.\nAs expected, Manchester City have the highest amount of build-up attacks in the Premier League this season, so if United do win the ball high up in Sunday's derby, they need to start taking those chances.\nTen Hag on misfiring strikers: We need to be better\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag speaks on the improvement he's seen in goalkeeper Andre Onana and insists he believes Marcus Rashford can get back to scoring goals\nUnited go into Sunday's derby with a slight striker scoring problem. City forward Erling Haaland has scored more Premier League goals this season (9) than United's five forwards have managed in all competitions (8).\nUnited's top scorer this season is actually defensive midfielder Casemiro with four strikes so far.\nAsked if their forwards are to blame for this frontline problem, Ten Hag replied: \"Fault? It's co-operation. It has to click.\n\"We have shown in some games, we have so many in overload positions to the opponents goal and we don't net or don't even hit the target. We should be doing this better.\"\nIt has been a sobering start to the season for Marcus Rashford, who has one goal so far this term for United. But Ten Hag says he has full faith that the England forward, who scored 30 goals last season, can find his scoring boots again.\n\"If you give him the trust and I play him every game, most games also he finishes the game. I have strong belief he will return to scoring a lot of goals,\" said Ten Hag.\n\"It also has to do with the co-operation, with the movement around and the distribution to him. We have to work on that and that's my focus point.\"\n\nThis article was published by Sky Sports on 2023-10-28 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":571}

From the world-famous Whistler Blackcomb and its attractive resort towns to the steep verticals of Revelstoke, there\u2019s enough choice \u2013 for every level of skier \u2013 to keep you coming back for years.\nFamilies, couples and groups alike can enjoy varied, all-round resorts like charming Tremblant, beginner-friendly family resorts such as Big White and expert areas like Fernie, with some of North America\u2019s steepest terrain, best runs and most challenging off-piste.\nSeveral of the resorts can be combined into one single trip too, offering exceptional variety and thousands of acres in areas of outstanding natural beauty, such as Banff National Park.\nAdd to this reliable snow cover and some of the longest ski seasons in the world and there\u2019s a compelling case for making your next ski trip to a Canadian resort. Below, we\u2019ve rounded up the best.\nWhistler Blackcomb\nWhistler is Canada\u2019s best-known resort (Getty Images)\nUndeniably Canada\u2019s most famed ski resort, Whistler Blackcomb has a legendary reputation as an excellent ski area for all levels of skier. The largest ski resort in North America, it is home to over 8,100 acres of skiable terrain and over 200 runs. Some 55 per cent of these are marked as intermediate runs, though there are great beginner areas at the base of Blackcomb and mid-way up Whistler. There are several excellent advanced areas too, including the Flute Bowl, West Bowl and Spankey\u2019s Ladder, with the longest runs offering a 1,500-metre vertical.\nThe town of Whistler was purpose-built and has quickly developed into one of the world\u2019s premier resorts. There are plenty of non-skiing activities available and several options for kids, while the apres is among some of the best in North America, centred around venues like Merlin\u2019s, Dusty\u2019s and BrewHouse.\nBook it\nHeidi offers packages to The Westin Resort & Spa, two minutes from the slopes and just over five away from the town centre. Inside, the rooms are spacious, modern and come with excellent views which are only beaten by those offered from the terrace and grill restaurant.\nFrom \u00a33,073pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Vancouver and airport transfers. Departing 13 January 2024.\nRead more on ski holidays:\nTremblant\nTremblant is Quebec\u2019s premier resort (Getty Images)\nQuebec\u2019s premier ski resort sits at the foot of the eponymous mountain, whose pistes cater well to all abilities. Beginners can start their ski journey at the edge of the village before progressing onto a series of long greens, including the Flying Mile. There are a number blues for intermediates, especially in the areas around Le Soleil and the Lowell Thomas lift, while advanced skiers can enjoy several terrain parks and steep black runs on both the north and south side of the mountain.\nThe idyllic, purpose-built village has been deliberately built in the style of Old Quebec, with plenty of colourful facades and French-Canadian charm. It offers lively apres and nightlife, often bolstered when locals flock in from Montreal. Non-skiing activities include ice skating, ice fishing and long walking trails, plus there\u2019s a village casino.\nBook it\nBritish Airways Holidays has trips to the Fairmont Tremblant, one of the more grand hotels in the resort, with an excellent ski-in\/ski-out location that lies just a few metres from the lifts. The hotel has impressive spa, pool and sauna facilities, along with a large terrace, restaurant and outdoor hot tub.\nFrom \u00a31,329pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Montreal and airport transfers. Departing 20 January 2024.\nSunshine Village\nSunshine Village is one of three ski resorts in the Banff National Park (Getty Images)\nSunshine Village lies around 20 minutes away from the town of Banff, with over 3,000 acres of ski area that is famed for its snow quality and reliable coverage, reflected in its long season that typically runs from mid-November to late May. It is another all-round area that caters almost equally to every level of skier, starting at the greens on the slopes of Mount Standish. Intermediates are at home in the areas served by the Continental Divide lift and the Tee Pee Town Express, while the more advanced should make a beeline for Goats Eye Mountain. The off-piste at Delirium Dive is also noteworthy.\nBanff is the place to stay for livelier evenings and decent accessibility, though due to the town\u2019s distance from the ski area, there is less of an \u2018apres\u2019 culture on the slopes.\nBook it\nStay at the newest hotel in Banff with a package from Inghams. The four-star Moose Hotel & Suites sits in the downtown area, offering comfortable rooms \u2013 with balcony or patio areas that provide great views of the Rockies \u2013 and a spa that features two heated rooftop pools that remain open in winter. You\u2019ll be a short shuttle away from Sunshine Village, or it\u2019s a 40-minute journey over to neighbouring Lake Louise.\nFrom \u00a31,482pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Calgary and transfers. Departing 27 January 2024.\nFernie\nFernie is paradise for more advanced skiers and snowboarders (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nThough a little smaller than some rivals at 2,500 acres, Fernie has gained a reputation as an excellent area for advanced skiers, with the added bonus of an average of nine metres of snowfall annually. The mountain is divided into seven sections, the lowest of which offers groomed green slopes for beginners, but the real attraction in Fernie is the ungroomed, steep terrain and tree skiing.\nThe most challenging runs are at Polar Peak and Currie Bowl, with tree skiing at Siberia or Timber Bowl. The runs around the Timber Bowl Express are more open and longer, with a 650-metre vertical.\nWhen picking accommodation, beware that Fernie\u2019s resort village, while convenient, is fairly small and quiet. The town of Fernie itself is far more lively and has good bus links to the resort five miles away.\nBook it\nWelcome in the New Year in style with a stay in Fernie courtesy of Ski Solutions. Mark the celebrations at Lizard Creek Lodge, a ski-in\/ski-out hotel where the views from the terrace and balconies are only rivalled by those on the slopes. Head into town in the evenings in a rental car, included in the package price.\nFrom \u00a31,795pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights from a London airport, airport transfers and car hire. Departing 30 December 2023.\nBig White\nBig White offers great tree runs (Getty Images)\nBig White is one of the best choices in the country for beginners, intermediates and those looking to learn to ski powder, with less steep terrain and plenty of shelter and tree runs. Located in the Okanagan Highlands, this 2,800-acre resort was purpose built for ski-in\/ski-out access, providing easy access to the slopes from most of the accommodation.\nSome 18 per cent of its 119 runs designated as beginner, while intermediates have the pick of the slopes, with over 50 per cent catering to them. Though the resort is less advanced-friendly, there are challenging areas out in the open at the top of the mountain.\nMarketed as \u2018Canada\u2019s favourite family resort\u2019, Big White is also a great destination for a ski holiday with the kids. The \u2018Happy Valley\u2019 area at the bottom of the village provides several non-skiing activities, and there are enough good restaurants to fill your stay if needed.\nBook it\nSki Safari offers February half-term getaways to Big White with a stay at the aptly named Chateau Big White in the centre of town. Close to the slopes and with convenient ski-in\/ski-out access, it has the ideal location for exploring both the pistes and the local area. Guests can sample food at the on-site Swiss Bear restaurant or the Black Diamond Bar & Grill.\nPrices for two adults and two children under 12 years from \u00a31,280pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights and transfers. Flights are arranged and quoted upon enquiry. Departing 10 February 2024.\nLake Louise\nLake Louise is the largest of the resorts in Banff National Park (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nLake Louise lies a little further away from Banff than Sunshine Village, but offers a larger ski area and some of the most amazing views in Banff National Park, including that of the famed Mount Assiniboine. Beginners will find the area around the foot of the hill a good start, while the area around the Grizzly Express and Larch Express lifts contains good beginner runs and some top-to-bottom greens. Much of the rest suits intermediates, while the Back Bowls are good for the more advanced.\nMost people will choose to base themselves in Banff, though the 45-minute drive to Lake Louise may put some off. A lift pass to the \u2018Ski Big 3\u2019 area covers Lake Louise, Sunshine Village and nearby Mount Norquay, but a stay in Lake Louise itself is a great option for a relaxing week split between skiing, the odd visit to Banff and seeing what this charming village has to offer.\nBook it\nAnother offering from Fairmont is the magnificent Chateau Lake Louise, a historic hotel located right next to the shores of the lake itself. Crystal Ski offers the most affordable package here, with a stay in an elegant double room that boasts delightful views of the Rockies. You\u2019ll be five minutes away from town, with the ski area accessible using a free, 10-minute shuttle bus.\nFrom \u00a31,904pp, including seven nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Calgary and transfers. Departing 27 January 2024.\nRevelstoke\nRevelstoke is one of Canada\u2019s newest resorts (Getty Images\/iStockphoto)\nRevelstoke has managed to gain a glowing reputation despite existing for much less time than most of its rivals (it opened in 2007). Another resort that is well-known for the quality and quantity of its snow, it is still a work in progress \u2013 you can currently explore around 3,000 of the intended 8,000 acres \u2013 but is already a highly regarded destination for those of an intermediate level or higher.\nMount Mackenzie possesses everything from well-groomed, long blues like the 4km Snow Rodeo to steep open terrain or tree-skiing around the North and South Bowls, with a vertical of 1,700 metres that is the longest on the continent. Heli-skiing is also popular in Revelstoke, opening up access to 500,000 acres and 400 runs.\nBook it\nBook a stay at The Sutton Place hotel with Ski Safari. A refreshing blend of alpine facades and modern American interiors, it has large suites and impressive facilities including indoor and outdoor pools and three restaurants. Even better, it sits less than 50 metres from one of the main gondolas for easy access to the slopes.\nFrom \u00a32,455pp, including 10 nights\u2019 accommodation, room-only, return flights and airport transfers. Flights are arranged and quoted upon enquiry.

Its $60 membership pays for itself quickly with holiday purchases, especially if you buy food products in bulk (this is outside of Polygon\u2019s purview, but you cannot beat its deal on Kerrygold butter).\nWalmart Plus costs $99 per year ($50 for a limited time), and serves as a ticket to get in on deals before other Walmart shoppers, plus other perks. Note: You won\u2019t get early access to deals with its free 30-day trial; you must be a paid member to earn access, so hit \u201cSkip trial for Early Access\u201d when signing up.\nThen you have Best Buy\u2019s My Best Buy Plus and Total memberships, costing $49.99 and $179.99, respectively. As for what each offers, check out Best Buy\u2019s page that spells it all out. This page details all of the exclusive deals, which can help you quickly recoup the cost of the membership.\nAmazon Prime members get free games and DLC all year\nAmazon offers freebies for Prime members \u2019round the calendar year, not just during the holiday months. Those offerings expire over time and new ones are added, and Amazon\u2019s suite of giveaways has improved over time.\nWe collect all of the latest free games and DLC that Amazon is giving away right here. To give you a taste, Rage 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Doom 3 are some of what\u2019s up for grabs right now.\nYou\u2019ll get price matching if you shop at the right time\nSome major retailers are ensuring price protection on purchases right now.\nAmazon does not price match, which is annoying, but it\u2019s tolerable since it often has the lowest prices of all retailers anyway. Amazon only protects the price on pre-orders that have its \u201cPre-order Price Guarantee,\u201d which ensures that you\u2019ll pay the lowest amount a product sells for before it\u2019s launched.\nNot only does Best Buy match prices from \u201cqualified competitors,\u201d but its site says that most products bought between now and Dec. 30 can be price-matched through Jan. 13, 2024.\nWalmart\u2019s policy says it won\u2019t price match with competitors, nor does it price match for products purchased online that later decrease in price.\nTarget says that purchases made between Oct. 22 and Dec. 24 can be price-adjusted if the cost lowers in the span of time, and if you show proof of purchase. You may be eligible for a price match on a purchase, but the rules for submitting documentation vary depending on whether you\u2019re shopping online or in store. It\u2019s all explained here.\nMost Black Friday return policies extend through January 2024\nAccording to Best Buy, certain products bought now (dating back to Oct. 27) until Dec. 30 may be returned before Jan. 13.\nTarget will accept most unopened items in new condition within 90 days of purchase.\nWalmart has an extended holiday return policy in effect that allows items purchased between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 to be returned on or before Jan. 31, 2024.\nAmazon\u2019s extended return policy is in effect for most items that are purchased between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31. Those items can be returned before Jan. 31, 2024. However, Apple-brand products purchased in that time frame can only be returned on or before Jan. 15, 2024.\nBlack Friday likely won\u2019t be your last opportunity to save\nThere will be amazing deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday on everything, from tabletop and board games to toys, video games, and more. However, it likely won\u2019t be the last opportunity for you to save. As someone who\u2019s been covering deals for The Verge and Polygon for years, I\u2019m shocked by how often I see these low prices, often spoken of as if they\u2019re a flash in the pan, extending through much of December. That said, it\u2019s more likely that price cuts on products you want can go by unnoticed unless you\u2019re tracking deals yourself.\nTrack deals yourself\nWe love to tell you about great deals. But there\u2019s a limit to the kind of products that we write about, and the ones that we see. If you\u2019re not comfortable leaving it up to the chance that we\u2019re going to tell you about price cuts on the products you really want, you have the power to track deals with relative ease.\nIf you only shop on Amazon, CamelCamelCamel remains one of the best tools for tracking price changes and history for products. While you don\u2019t need an account to see pricing information available through the app, making a profile will allow you to set up watchlists and get email price alerts for your favorite products. You\u2019re welcome to manually populate your own watchlist, but the app also allows you to import any existing Amazon wishlist into your CamelCamelCamel profile. Make sure to grab its Camelizer browser extension, too.\nHoney and its accompanying extension allow you to track pricing history changes on specific products, but across a number of retailers, not just Amazon. Also, as an added bonus, Honey will also automatically search for promo codes when you check out at a supported retailer.\n\nThis article, authored by Cameron Faulkner, was published by Polygon on 2023-11-12 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":574}
{"title":"Some of our favorite devices are on sale for Black Friday.","context":"## Some of our favorite devices are on sale for Black Friday.\n\nBlack Friday and Cyber Monday may be in the past, but some sales are still hanging around (although maybe not for long). For more leftover deals we recommend across all categories, be sure to check out the rest of the Cyber Monday still available here.\nEvery month or so, we like to ask our staff about their favorite stuff \u2014 whether it\u2019s pet toys, travel aids, kitchen gadgets, or straightforward tech. And the results are usually very different, very interesting, and a lot of fun.\nIn celebration of the annual post-Thanksgiving sales, we looked through some of our recent \u201cfavorites\u201d articles and found deals on a lot of the tech, kitchen tools, travel aids, and pet toys we like. We thought we\u2019d list a few in case you\u2019ve read about them in the past and thought, \u201cWell, that sort of sounds good, but it\u2019s a bit pricey.\u201d (Or, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty cheap, but maybe I\u2019ll wait until the price goes down some more...\u201d)\nSo here are some of our staff\u2019s most-liked gear and gadgets, much of which is still discounted from Cyber Monday.\nTech tools\nElectronics repair kit\nAlex Cranz, managing editor\nTekton Everybit Tech Rescue Kit $ 22 $ 29 24 % off $ 22 $ 22 $ 29 24 % off A 46-piece screwdriver kit that can help you repair practically any tech device out there. $22 at Amazon\nI own at least two of these little Tekton Everybit Tech Rescue Kits, and I frequently buy them for friends and family, too. For an average price of $35, you get a screwdriver with nearly every bit you\u2019d need for most gadgets (including the weird ones for Apple products), a plastic and a metal spudger, tweezers, and a suction cup. I\u2019ve replaced batteries in iPhones with this kit. I\u2019ve built entire PCs with this kit. I\u2019ve swapped out backplates on Steam Decks and housings of Joy-Con controllers with one of these kits. I\u2019ve even used it to repair my eyeglasses.\nOne of the best parts of the kit is it all goes in a single case that can be tossed in a computer bag or purse or be left in a desk drawer at the office. But honestly, the main reason I love it is the selection and quality of the bits. Too often, precision screwdrivers have super soft bits that strip the first time you use them with a screw that\u2019s been tightened by a machine. Given that most gadgets have at least one too-tight screw, I\u2019ve gone through quite a few cheap screwdriver kits before I settled on this one. While I\u2019m slowly building out a high-quality selection of precision screwdrivers, most people don\u2019t have that luxury or necessity. This is a great alternative \u2014 plus, you feel like kind of a badass when someone asks you to help fix a gadget, and you just pull this kit out of your bag in the middle of Starbucks and get to work.\nSafety cutter\nEmilia David, reporter\nI admit TikTok made me buy this small safety cutter, but it\u2019s been indispensable to someone who may or may not have an online shopping addiction. The Slice Micro Ceramic Blade safety cutter\u2019s tiny blade cuts through paper packaging tape cleanly, opens plastic wrapping, and keeps me from going insane opening blister packaging. It doesn\u2019t damage whatever is inside, which unfortunately happens very often with my regular metal box cutter.\nThe downside is that it\u2019s so small you may lose track of it if not in use, but it does have a built-in magnet and a handy dandy hole for a keyring. And while it doesn\u2019t fully slice through a cardboard box, it will still leave a scratch, although that could ultimately damage the ceramic blade if not used properly. I\u2019ve had my Slice Micro for a few months, so I\u2019m not worried about it dulling yet, but it is unclear if the blade is replaceable.\nHeadphone hanger\nKaitlin Hatton, audience manager\nAnchor Pro under-desk headphone hanger $ 12 $ 15 20 % off $ 12 $ 12 $ 15 20 % off An under-desk dual headphone hanger that uses 3M adhesive for mounting and an included Velcro strap to anchor a headphone cable. $12 at Amazon\nI gave this a try for one of our TikTok videos, and it has not disappointed me yet. I use it to hold my Razer Kraken headset and some extra cords. It\u2019s small enough to remain out of the way but large enough to hold more than the headset itself. It has a pretty strong hold and doesn\u2019t give, even as I raise my standing desk up and down several times a day. It\u2019s not the prettiest accessory one can attach to their desk, but it is highly functional.\nCharging station\nJess Weatherbed, news writer\nI got this as a birthday present from my partner after several months of arguing over our sleeping arrangements. Something about me trailing the charging cables for my devices in the bed being \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cextremely uncomfortable.\u201d Anyway, after begrudgingly acknowledging my poor charging habits, I have to admit that having this on my desk has had benefits outside of not garroting myself mid-slumber.\nMy iPhone, Apple Watch, and wireless earbuds rarely run out of juice, as I no longer fall asleep before plugging them in. I\u2019ve also taken to using the charger\u2019s upright positioning for phones to my advantage \u2014 serving as a desk clock, a tiny display for Slack or Discord, and as a hub to remotely control the various smart devices around my home. It helps me separate the device from being my phone and instead helps me build the habit of it being another tool to boost my productivity.\nHelp for the cook\nA multipurpose rice cooker\nVictoria Song, senior reviewer\nZojirushi Micom Rice Cooker and Warmer $ 194 $ 233 17 % off $ 194 $ 194 $ 233 17 % off A 5.5-cup-capacity rice cooker and warmer that not only cooks rice but also comes with a steaming basket to double as a steamer and a cake menu setting to bake cakes. $194 at Amazon\nA lot of people will tell you that rice cookers are single-use appliances meant only for rice \u2014 they\u2019re wrong. A rice cooker is best at cooking rice, but it can do a lot of the same things as an Instant Pot. For instance, you can use it to cook hardboiled eggs or oatmeal, steam vegetables, make porridge, make one-pot meals, and even bake a cake.\nI grew up with giant 10-cup rice cookers at home, but I didn\u2019t appreciate how versatile this appliance was until I left the country for college. A tiny two-cup rice cooker kept me fed in my cramped 250-square-foot Tokyo apartment. It was programmable, so I could wash my rice, stick it in the cooker, and know that when I woke up late for class, I could still whip up some ochazuke or oatmeal for a quick, cheap, and nutritious breakfast. (It also took the hassle out of steel-cut oats.) Whenever I had a craving for sweets, it was so easy to take pancake mix and bake a Japanese-style cheesecake for one.\nI\u2019ve since graduated to a 5.5-cup Zojirushi Micom Rice Cooker, and it\u2019s one of the handiest tools I have for meal prepping. When I was sick this past winter, I made ample use of its porridge setting to make a congee-type dish with chicken and ginger \u2014 just like my mom used to make when I was a kid. The fact that it\u2019ll keep something warm for days, meant I could crawl out of bed, scoop out some porridge, and crawl back into bed with minimal effort. When I\u2019m feeling lazy, I throw eggs in there, and bam \u2014 some extra hard-boiled protein. Mine also comes with a little basket, so it\u2019s super easy to throw in veggies or steam frozen dumplings.\nBut what I like most is that rice cookers are more space-efficient than Instant Pots. In my kitchen, the one spot where I could fit an Instant Pot is instead occupied by a rice cooker, blender, and spoon rest. A multitasking kitchen gadget that doesn\u2019t take over your entire counter? That\u2019s a must if you live in a small space.\nOld-fashioned toaster oven\nAmelia Holowaty Krales, senior photo editor\nI love a toaster oven! It\u2019s compact, works fast, and is perfect for reheating pizza, making nachos, and yes, even toast. I use my toaster oven more than my regular oven for sure \u2014 and probably more than any other item in my kitchen. I have a pretty basic model like this one, but these days, many come with other features, like air frying and convection oven capabilities.\nSeal in your fresh food\nEmma Roth, news writer\nFoodSaver vacuum sealer machine $ 147 $ 220 33 % off $ 147 $ 147 $ 220 33 % off Keep food fresh by squeezing all the air out of the package and sealing it for long- or short-term storage. $147 at Amazon\nI never knew how much I needed a vacuum sealer until I actually got one. I\u2019m the type of person who shops at wholesale clubs despite only needing food for two people, so when I buy meat, I get a lot of it all at once, some of which inevitably gets stored in my fridge or freezer. That\u2019s where my vacuum sealer comes in.\nWhile I can\u2019t speak to the quality of other vacuum sealers, the FoodSaver I have is awesome. Not only does the thing help keep raw meat and other food fresher for longer in the fridge, but it also helps save space in the freezer (each package of meat becomes much flatter when all the air is sucked out of it). With this little machine, I can load up whatever I want in one of the FoodSaver bags, insert the open end into the machine, which vacuums up all the air and then closes the bag using its heat sealing feature in one fell swoop. It\u2019s pretty neat!\nFor the traveler\nCarry-on backpack\nKaitlin Hatton, audience manager\nEarlier this year, I committed to traveling more, and so I took a look at the gear I had that could be replaced after years of trekking the globe. My ratty old secondhand carry-on bag was the first thing to be replaced. After several days of weighing the pros and cons of various travel bags, I stumbled upon this Lumesner carry-on backpack on Amazon, and it fit all of my needs. It can carry a laptop, several days\u2019 worth of clothes, my 40oz Hydro Flask bottle, and more. The bag even includes some packing cubes. It\u2019s very comfortable, and the weight is well distributed when it\u2019s completely full. It\u2019s an inexpensive alternative to many name-brand carry-on bags, too. So far, I\u2019ve used it on a handful of trips, and the quality has held up. It also holds onto pet fur, though, so I had to add a small lint roller to my travel necessities. But that\u2019s just life while traveling with a dog anyway.\nAn extension cord for awkward situations\nSarah Jeong, deputy features editor\nAnker 321 Power Strip $ 15 $ 26 42 % off $ 15 $ 15 $ 26 42 % off This all-in-one 20W USB-C power cube boasts three AC outlets, two USB-A ports, and one USB-C port. $15 at Amazon\nNobody wants to carry a power strip or an extension cord with them on their vacation. It\u2019s probably unnecessary if you\u2019re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you\u2019re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it\u2019s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there\u2019s already two lamps plugged into it.\nOlder buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they\u2019re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this Anker combination extension cord \/ power strip. It\u2019s not a full power strip \u2014 just a cube with a few sockets along with USB and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I\u2019ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.\nThe three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people\u2019s devices.\nIf you\u2019re traveling overseas, don\u2019t forget to purchase a different plug type for the region you\u2019re going to or pack an adapter.\nA portable smart speaker\nBrandon Widder, senior commerce editor\nSonos Roam $ 134 $ 180 26 % off $ 134 $ 134 $ 180 26 % off The Sonos Roam is a truly portable Sonos speaker with a rugged design that\u2019s built to withstand the elements. It also features wireless charging and supports AirPlay 2, Alexa, and Google Assistant. $134 at Best Buy$134 at Sonos\nFor the longest time, my go-to portable speaker for camping and backpacking was the Ultimate Ears Roll 2. It was small and efficient, but it didn\u2019t mesh well with the rest of my audio setup, especially on those sweltering summer days when I barely made it beyond the confines of my own backyard.\nA couple of years ago, however, I splurged on the Sonos Roam. The rugged, pint-sized device is on the pricier side when compared to other Bluetooth speakers, but it produces solid sound for the size, offers wireless charging, and can automatically jump between my home Wi-Fi network and Bluetooth, a convenience I\u2019ve come to appreciate when strapping the speaker to my bike and heading out the door.\nAnd while I might not be able to fire off my usual quips at Alexa when I take it into the backcountry \u2014 the Roam only supports voice commands when connected to Wi-Fi \u2014 I certainly can still do it poolside with a drink in hand.\nUniversal travel adapter\nVictoria Song, senior reviewer\nEpicka universal travel adapter $ 20 $ 25 20 % off $ 20 $ 20 $ 25 20 % off Epicka\u2019s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries. $20 at Amazon\nIn my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you\u2019ve landed in another country isn\u2019t always easy, either. And if you\u2019re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don\u2019t always have more than one plug for your American devices \u2014 in which case, you\u2019ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.\nBasically, it\u2019s six plug adaptors in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it\u2019s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you\u2019ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it\u2019s a game-changer. What I like about this one from Epicka is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.\nThe only caveat is that, although it says \u201cuniversal,\u201d it\u2019s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That\u2019ll get you by in most countries, but it\u2019s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I\u2019ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store.\nLovely lights\nBrandon Widder, senior commerce editor\nI\u2019m a big fan of ambient lighting, even when I\u2019m 50 miles from the nearest outlet. And while I\u2019ve long been a proponent of MPOWERD\u2019s solar-powered Luci lanterns, I recently picked up the company\u2019s like-minded string lights for car camping and overnight jaunts in the backcountry when I don\u2019t mind toting a little extra weight with me.\nThe 18-foot string is certainly not the brightest you can buy \u2014 it packs a series of 100-lumen LEDs, whereas your average headlamp might offer 400 \u2014 but it can swap between six different colors and features a 2,000mAh battery for when your phone needs some emergency juice. Best of all, you can charge the lights via USB or solar, meaning you can spend less time worrying about how to keep them going and more time taking in the vibes.\nMemory card holder and reader\nBecca Farsace, senior producer\nAs a video person who is constantly on the move, there is nothing better than the consolidation of gear \u2014 especially when it pertains to dongles. So when fellow video extraordinaire Vjeran Pavic (The Verge\u2019s supervising producer) recently surprised me with a very cute birthday note and this magical little gadget, I was elated.\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, it has a carabiner hook. It is everything I have ever wanted in a rubber case and more. To have both my SD card reader and all my cards in one place is priceless (well, actually $39.95). Thank you, Vjeran. <3\nA mobile tripod for holiday snaps\nJess Weatherbed, news writer\nWhen you go on holiday with your partner or family, you generally get stuck with three options when it comes to taking group photographs: a cramped selfie, leaving someone out to take the picture, or asking a total stranger to take it for you. Not to be dramatic or anything, but I\u2019d rather not ruin my vacation by trying to figure out which individuals nearby are the least likely to dip the minute I hand over my phone. And it\u2019s depressing to think that my mum is in so few of our family photos because she was always the person on the other side of the camera.\nA decent Bluetooth-enabled tripod can resolve these issues. I\u2019ve had good experiences using Atumtek\u2019s 60-inch Self-Stick Tripod \u2014 it features a discreet, detachable Bluetooth shutter remote that you can pair with your smartphone, sparing you from having to set a timer and run like hell. Simply get into position and use the remote to snap as many shots as you need to ensure it\u2019s caught you at a flattering angle. It also extends up to 60 inches to squeeze everyone into a group selfie if you\u2019re using it as a selfie stick. This could be a brilliant gift for any \u201cInstagram boyfriends\u201d who spend hours of their vacations as their partner\u2019s dedicated paparazzi.\nA car-friendly charger\nSean Hollister, senior editor\nMaybe someday Apple will realize that it wasn\u2019t the brightest idea to artificially limit the reach of its MagSafe charging ecosystem and you\u2019ll be able to plop your phone on a magical minimalist disc that charges it at high speeds. In the meanwhile, a standard Qi charger is about the best you\u2019ll get \u2014 and the bulky but practical iOttie Easy One Touch Qi does it with the satisfying snap of springs. When you push your phone into its waiting jaws, it depresses a button that causes those jaws to firmly snap closed on either side of your device. When you want to remove it, you pinch a pair of levers with your finger and thumb to release as you grab your slab. It\u2019s wide enough to fit practically anything on the market, save an opened Samsung Z Fold. I\u2019ve used one for years with Android and Apple phones alike, including newer MagSafe handsets.\nA colorful fanny pack\nVictoria Song, senior reviewer\nI\u2019ve always been stymied by the need for a bag smaller than a backpack or knapsack but larger than a dinky clutch. I was wary of the whole \u201cwear a fanny pack as a mini crossbody bag\u201d trend, but earlier this summer, I caved and bought the Baboon to the Moon 3L Fannypack.\nNow, I cannot go back. This bag easily fits my wallet, phone, house keys, car keys, hand sanitizer, and chapstick \u2014 everything I need when I take walks or run errands. It\u2019s also got a quick-release buckle, so I can stick a carabiner on it and schlepp around a water bottle on hot days. The material is also incredibly durable, spill-proof, and easy to clean. The inside has some dividers but nothing too complicated.\nBut what I probably like most about this fanny pack (and this brand in general) is how colorful their bags are. I got one in lavender, stuck some enamel pins on it, and now there\u2019s absolutely no mistaking this is mine. I can see it easily from a distance, which also makes it harder to lose. The mix between colorful whimsy and practical functionality is something I wish I saw more often. All I\u2019m saying is that two of my friends went out and bought the same bag in different colors as soon as they saw me wearing it. And we\u2019re all immensely happy with our purchases.\nProducts for your pet\nHair remover\nMitchell Clark, former news writer\nChomChom pet hair remover $ 25 $ 32 22 % off $ 25 $ 25 $ 32 22 % off The ChomChom is a reusable cat and dog hair remover that works great for furniture.\n$25 at Amazon\nThe ChomChom pet hair remover is an extraordinarily simple device \u2014 it\u2019s basically a couple of pieces of plastic, fabric, and rubber. But through some dark magic, it\u2019s better at getting cat hair off my couch, cat tree, and other upholstery than even the adhesive-laden lint rollers (though those are still superior if the thing you\u2019re trying to de-pet is yourself). I\u2019d explain more, but honestly, I think the ChomChom can best be explained with this GIF:\nChomChom pet hair remover. GIF by Mitchell Clark \/ The Verge\nI know I\u2019m stretching the definition of \u201ctech\u201d here, but I just had to share the ChomChom because the first time I saw someone use it, my jaw dropped. I hope it can change your life like it did mine. (Note: as far as I can tell, the limited-edition cat ChomChom that I paid extra for is 0 percent more functional than the regular one. It was still worth it, though.)\nFuzzy cat bed\nElizabeth Lopatto, senior reporter\nJeeves loves to be in the office with me while I work. (I assume she\u2019s supervising.) Anyway, to make her cozier, I got her this fuzzy cat bed. At first, she was afraid of it \u2014 she\u2019s extremely shy around new people and objects \u2014 but now, a year later, it\u2019s her favorite place to sit that isn\u2019t my lap. Usually, she spends the afternoon snuggled up in it.\nDistracting dog toy\nKaitlin Hatton, audience manager\nTrudee, otherwise known as My Boss, is notoriously insistent on being the focus of my attention. At any given moment, she has 20 toys strewn about my apartment, but she will not play with them unless I\u2019m watching her \u2014 like literally, no distractions, sitting within feet of her, just staring at her chew on her toys for hours on end.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love staring at my dog, but she doesn\u2019t get the enrichment she deserves when her activity levels are tied directly to my ability to give her undivided attention. That is, until I bought the Pet Fit For Life Plush Wand. It has a toy attached to a long chewable rope that is suspended from a metal pole. Now, I not only toss the toy about the room from the comfort of my couch but also Trudee is so distracted by chasing it that she doesn\u2019t notice if I am not making direct eye contact. It\u2019s a win-win.\nVerge Deals \/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\nApple's Cyber Monday Promotion\nApple notoriously doesn't run sales on its own storefront. However, it does usually throw in a gift card for Apple Store credit if you purchase select items. This year, now through November 27, you can get up to $200 in Apple Store credit to use later if you purchase certain items. For example, if you buy an iPhone 14 or iPhone SE, you can get up to $75 in store credit. Buy a MacBook Air and you'll get up to $200. You can find the full list here.\nSeparately, there's also a sale on Apple gift cards on Amazon. Each one has a unique corresponding coupon code that you can see on this page. For example, you can get a $100 Apple Gift Card and a free $15 Amazon credit with code APPLET5USAP. There are tons of cards to choose from. You can browse them all here.\nJump to a Topic: iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, Beats and AirPods, Chargers, Cases and Accessories.\niPad and Accessory Deals\nFor more info, check out our Best iPads guide for a breakdown of every iPad model.\niPad Photograph: Apple\nThis is the best iPad (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) for most people in our Best iPads guide. It's not only affordable, but it also packs a ton of great features, including a True Tone display (that adjusts the color temperature to match the ambient lighting in your environment), a 12-megapixel rear camera with support for Center Stage (which keeps you in the frame on video calls), 64 gigabytes of storage on the base model, and a Touch ID-enabled home button. It's compatible with accessories like the first-generation Apple Pencil and Apple's Smart Keyboard.\nThis iPad (7\/10, WIRED Review) isn't our top choice (we recommend the ninth-gen model over this one largely due to the price). But it does pack a few notable changes. With no Home button and slimmer bezels around the screen, it has a modern design. There's an upgraded rear camera and the selfie camera has moved to the center of the iPad for video calls. Under the hood is Apple's A14 Bionic chip (the same that's in the iPhone 12), so it's more powerful than the last-gen model. It was on sale for the same price last Cyber Monday.\niPad Air Photograph: Apple\nIf you're looking for an iPad that's a bit more powerful than the ninth-gen model, we recommend the iPad Air (8\/10, WIRED Recommends). It comes equipped with a 10.9-inch LCD screen, slim bezels, a USB-C port Touch ID built into the top power button, and the same M1 processor as the 2020 MacBook Air. It packs support for the Smart Keyboard Cover, Magic Keyboard Cover, along with the second-generation and USB-C Apple Pencil. It's worth mentioning Apple might be launching a new version next year, but the M1-powered iPad Air is still a great choice.\nThe iPad Mini (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite tablet for travel. It's small enough to slip into my tote bag and fits perfectly on an airplane tray table. The 8.3-inch display is great for reading ebooks, watching movies, sketching, and taking notes (it's compatible with the second-generation and USB-C Apple Pencils). Powered by the A15 Bionic processor (the same one found in the iPhone 13), it can easily handle taxing apps and games. As with the iPad Air, Apple is rumored to be launching a next-gen version next year with a faster processor, but this is still a solid tablet if you don't need the latest and greatest.\nWe've used this hub with iPads, but it's also great for MacBooks. Plug it in via the USB-C port on your laptop and you'll have access to another USB-C port for passthrough charging, a USB-A port, an HDMI output, and a headphone jack. It's also fairly compact and thin, so it won't add too much bulk to your laptop. It dipped to $40 back in August, but we still think this is a good deal.\nApple Pencil Photograph: Apple\nThe first-gen Apple Pencil has been around for a while now, but it still functions well. It packs features like pressure sensitivity (the lines get thicker as you press down harder on the screen), tilt sensitivity (for shading), and handwriting support within search fields and apps (like Notes). It's compatible with the iPad (6th gen and later), iPad Air (3rd gen), iPad Mini (5th gen), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st and 2nd gen), iPad Pro 10.5-inch, and iPad Pro 9.7-inch. It dips to this price often, but we still think it's a good deal.\nThis is the most feature-packed stylus Apple has to offer. It's compatible with the iPad Air (4th gen and later), iPad Mini (6th gen), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st gen and later), and the 12.9-inch (3rd gen and later). As with the first-gen model, it comes with pressure sensitivity, tilt sensitivity, and handwriting support, plus wireless pairing and wireless charging (it'll charge when magnetically attached to the top edge of supported iPads). There's a double-tap feature too, which lets you switch between tools quickly by tapping on the Apple Pencil twice. It hits this low often, but it's a solid discount if you don't want to pay full price.\nThis stand often goes on sale during the holidays, but it's still a good deal. This tablet stand is included in several WIRED guides, including the Best iPad Accessories and the Best Work-from-Home Gear. It's portable, lightweight, and easy to use.\nThis adapter dongle has a 60-watt USB-C port, USB-A, MicroSD slot, SD card slot, 3.5-mm audio, and 4K 60-Hz HDMI, and it\u2019s sleek and compact. One of the nice things about Hyper\u2019s Apple peripherals is that they\u2019re designed to blend in with your Apple devices, so this dongle comes in a space gray metal enclosure with rounded edges that doesn\u2019t look out of place or stick out like a sore thumb when plugged into your iPad. Writer Jaina Grey has had one of these for years and despite frequently losing (and finding) it, it\u2019s an everyday carry item for her and really helps turn your iPad into a portable workstation.\nJump to a Topic: iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, Beats and AirPods, Chargers, Cases and Accessories.\nMacBook and Accessory Deals\nRead our Best MacBook guide for more.\nMacBook Pro Photograph: Apple\nIt's been less than a month since Apple released this MacBook Pro and it's already on sale. This M3 version replaces the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which Apple no longer sells through its stores. It packs the same mini LED screen, 120-Hz refresh rate, brighter display, and 1080p webcam as the high-end versions. You'll also get an HDMI, two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an SD card slot, a high-impedance headphone jack, and a MagSafe charging port. We recommend the M3 for anyone who wants some of the Pro features but doesn't want to drop almost $2,000 to get it.\nThis MacBook Pro (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) is less than a year old, but we only recommend it if you can find it for under $1,800. It packs all the same features as the latest version and the M2 Pro is more than capable of handling graphically demanding and intensive tasks. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this specific configuration.\nThis M3 Pro MacBook Pro is similar to the other model that's on sale. It just has a larger screen, a more powerful CPU, and slightly better graphics. Apple's brand-new M3 chips are available in three different MacBook tiers\u2014the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max (9\/10, WIRED Recommends). They're all included in our guide to the Best Laptops.\nApple's brand-new M3 chips are available in three different MacBook tiers\u2014the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max (9\/10, WIRED Recommends). They're all included in our guide to the Best Laptops. The M3 Pro falls in the middle as far as processing power and speed goes, but it's still blazing fast. We recommend that you opt for the Pro if you\u2019re a serious productivity user or content creator. This deal matches the best price we've seen so far.\nMacBook Air Photograph: Apple\nThe MacBook Air (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) packs a modern design complete with a MagSafe connector so the laptop won't fly off if you accidentally trip on the cable. Thanks to the M2 chip, it also delivers plenty of power for everyday tasks, solid battery life, and a 1080p webcam. It's dipped lower to $899 in the past, and it hits this price often, but we still think this is a solid deal. However, if you want the latest version, it's worth noting Apple is rumored to be launching an M3-powered version of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air next year. Keep in mind that this model drops to this sale price relatively often.\nIf you want a bigger screen, the 15-inch MacBook Air (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first large-screen option within the Air lineup. It packs all the same features as the 13-inch version including a redesigned chassis and 1080p webcam. The M2 also delivers excellent performance and solid battery life (with about 10 hours of use). For the smoothest experience, we recommend opting for 16 gigabytes of RAM if it's in your budget. It's also on sale for $1,449 ($250 off).\nThe M1-powered MacBook Air (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) came out in 2020, but it's still one of the most powerful laptops you can buy for this price. It remains our favorite budget MacBook to recommend. You'll get great performance and battery life (it'll easily last a full workday), an improved keyboard, and a lightweight chassis that's great for travel. It's worth mentioning, however, that it frequently goes on sale for this price.\nMac Mini Photograph: Apple\nThe Mac Mini (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) is a powerful, compact desktop. All you need to do is plug it into a monitor, pair it with your keyboard and mouse, and you're good to go. It doesn't pack as many ports as the version with the M2 Pro, but you'll still get two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, two USB-A, an HDMI, a 10-gigabit Ethernet connection, and a 3.5-mm headphone jack. It's dipped this low a few times before, but it's still a great deal.\nThis is our favorite external keyboard in our Best MacBook Accessories guide, especially if you're a fan of the Magic Keyboard on your MacBook and are looking to fully replicate your setup. This one comes with a Touch ID button, which you can use to log in, authenticate for purchases, and download apps. It also has the same function row keys as the M-series MacBooks, including playback buttons, a Mission Control Key, and a dedicated Do Not Disturb button.\nWith the ability to flex the stand up to 22 inches high, you can adjust this laptop stand depending on your setup\u2014whether you\u2019re using an external monitor or working solely off a MacBook. It\u2019s also super compact and portable. Our only complaint is that, while you can adjust the stand's angle up to 45 degrees, it\u2019s too wobbly to type on if you're using the laptop's keyboard.\nThis is both an affordable and well-built monitor. WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu has used it for years now and it's served him well. While the price often dips under $100, this is a few dollars lower than we've tracked.\nBaggu Puffy Laptop Sleeve Photograph: Baggu\nYou'll see the discount at checkout. The 16-inch version Baggu Laptop Sleeve in Sherbert Cherry looks just as cute in person as it does online. The puffiness provides plenty of protection, and the Velcro closure is strong enough you don\u2019t have to worry the laptop will slide out. We tested it with the 15-inch MacBook Air, which left space to squeeze a keyboard and mouse into the sleeve as well. There's also a 13-inch\/14-inch version for those who have smaller MacBooks or want a sleeve for their iPads.\nSpeck\u2019s Smartshell case has the proper cutouts for ports and rubberized feet to keep your machine in place. You can throw it in your backpack, tote, or duffle bag without worrying about damaging your machine. We tested it with the 14-inch MacBook Pro but it\u2019s also available for a wide range of MacBook models. It\u2019s worth noting, that the hardshell isn\u2019t scratch-resistant (despite Speck\u2019s claims)\u2014we\u2019ve noticed a few scrapes on ours here and there, but it\u2019s not too noticeable.\nThis keyboard is a runner-up in our Best MacBook Accessories guide. It mimics the MacBook keyboard with a Do Not Disturb key, and the ability to program the function row key with Apple's own apps like Final Cut Pro, Photos, Safari, and more, using the Logi Options+ app\u2014in addition to other Mac-specific shortcuts. It's only available with Tactile Quiet switches, but these are ideal if you typically work around other people and don\u2019t want to disturb them.\nThis microfiber mat will keep your desk looking nice and clean. It also doubles as a giant mousepad. It only comes in black, but it's a great option if you're looking for a desk mat that's minimalist and affordable.\nIncase Hardshell Case Dots Photograph: Incase\nThis is currently our favorite MacBook case. We tested it with the 16-inch MacBook Pro (2021), but it\u2019s available for a few MacBook models. It has rubberized feet that prevent it from sliding, precise cutouts for all ports, and ventilation to keep the MacBook from overheating.\nThe Das Keyboard MacTigr (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) is expensive, but it\u2019s great for those in the Apple ecosystem with a dedicated Mac layout. It also has cherry MX Red switches (that don\u2019t get too loud), a two-port USB-C hub, and a high-quality all-metal build.\nPhotograph: Keychron\nThis is WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu's current daily keyboard. You can use it wired or wirelessly via Bluetooth and it comes in several colors and switches to pick from (it\u2019s also RGB-backlit). The red switches aren\u2019t very loud but are still clicky, and there\u2019s a great knob for volume control. It\u2019s hot-swappable too, so you can change the switches whenever you\u2019d like.\nIf you prefer low-profile keys, the K3 Pro is a solid choice. The keys have a tactile click, RGB lighting, and you\u2019ll get around four to five days of battery life (with the ability to charge it via the USB-C charging port). You\u2019ll also get support for Via too, if you want additional software customization.\nThis is WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu's favorite portable monitor. It's a great second screen that doesn't take up any desk space, but it does require sticking adhesive magnets onto your laptop. It's best suited for 13- to 14-inch laptops and is best for apps like Slack rather than anything that needs crisp colors. It drops to this price often, but is still a good deal.\nApple Watch Deals\nRead our Best Apple Watch guide for an overview of the company's smartwatches.\nApple Watch Series 9 Photograph: Apple\nThe Series 9 (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest Apple Watch. If you're looking to upgrade, it offers faster performance, improved battery life, and a brighter display. There's also a new Double Tap feature that will trigger functions like playing music or hanging up a call by tapping your index finger and thumb. With the second-gen ultra-wideband chip, you can precision-locate your iPhone and AirPods too.\nIf you don't need all the in-depth capabilities that come with the Apple Watch Series 9, the second-generation Apple Watch SE is a great alternative. It still tracks crucial health and fitness features, and with the S8 chip, you'll also get Crash Detection and the redesigned Compass app. It has support for WatchOS 10 too, so you'll have access to the latest software updates.\nThe second-gen Apple Watch Ultra (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) packs a brighter 3,000-nit display, the latest S9 chip, and the new ultra-wideband chip for precision-locating your phone. You still get the useful Action button, the three-mic array, and the precise GPS so you can find your way home. It's the Apple Watch with the best battery life thanks to its gigantic size.\nJump to a Topic: iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, Beats and AirPods, Chargers, Cases and Accessories.\nBeats and AirPods Deals\nRead our Best Wireless Headphones and Best Wireless Earbuds guides for more.\nPowerbeats Pro Photograph: Beats\nThe Powerbeats Pro (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) are older (they came out in 2019), but they're still our top pick for earbuds with the most secure fit\u2014making these a great option to workout with. They have an IPX4 water-resistance rating too, which means they'll stay protected from sweat. These buds deliver excellent sound quality and pack nine hours of battery life (with an extra 18 hours in the case). Many of the features won't work with an Android phone, but the core features will.\nThe Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones (7\/10, WIRED Review) pack excellent noise canceling, good sound quality, and great wireless range. They also offer a stable fit and compact design. They are missing a few key features though, including multi-band EQ and sensors for auto-pause. But improved sound quality and active noise canceling, as well as a few neat features for both Apple and Android devices, make these a good option\u2014especially on sale. They're $10 cheaper than they were on Prime Day, making this the lowest price we've tracked.\nThe Beats Fit Pro (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) deliver great sound and a comfortable fit. With Apple's proprietary H1 chip, they work like AirPods when used with an iPhone. But they also work great with Android, complete with an app that allows you to customize the controls and perform a fit test. These have dipped as low as $159 in the past, but this is still a good discount.\nAirPods Pro Photograph: Apple\nApple just launched these AirPods (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) back in September, and they're already on sale. They're identical to the old pair on the outside but pack some internal upgrades. In addition to slightly improved sound, there's also a new Conversation Awareness mode (that turns the music down and boosts Transparency mode so you can hear someone talking to you).\nJump to a Topic: iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, Beats and AirPods, Chargers, Cases and Accessories.\nApple Charger Deals\nFor more options, check out our Best Apple 3-in-1 Wireless Chargers and Best MagSafe Power Banks guides.\nAnker MagGo 637 Photograph: Anker\nSimply stick your iPhone to this cute little orb and it'll start charging. Flip over to the back, and you'll find two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, and three AC outlets. It's a compact and tidy charger, and our unit has been going strong for more than two years. It fluctuates in price very often, and it's hit as low as $60 in the past, but we still think this is a good deal.\nThis power bank is one of our favorites if you're looking for an upgrade. It has an absolutely gargantuan 24,000-mAh capacity, and it can be charged up in an hour. It can output up to 140W, making it powerful enough to charge laptops and tablets, as well as charging your phone super quick.\nThis is a great charger if you travel often with an iPhone and Apple Watch. Instead of packing two separate chargers, the Duo offers the luxury of both all within a compact, foldable form factor. You can use it to charge your AirPods (as long as it comes with a wireless charging case) and other Qi-certified devices too.\nPhotograph: Zendure\nThe Zendure SuperTank Pro is the largest portable battery you can get away with taking onto an airplane. Which is why it's our favorite for air travel. With a 26,800-mAh capacity, four USB ports, and up to 100 watts in or out, it's the only portable power bank you'll need for every device on even extremely long flights. Plus it kinda looks like a mini carry-on suitcase, that's neat. Just be sure to click the coupon button to get the full deal.\nThis is a great power bank if you don't want to carry a cable around. It comes complete with a built-in rotating USB-C or Lightning connector (MFi certified) that slots into the bottom of your phone. It also packs a 5,000-mAh capacity and a USB-C port for recharging it (complete with a short cable). We don't recommend it if you have a thick case on your phone, though.\nThe best 2-in-1 stand in our Best Apple 3-in-1 Wireless Chargers guide has a MagSafe spot to charge your iPhone at top speed (up to 15 watts) and a recessed spot below for your AirPods case. It holds your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation, which is great for StandBy. It's not a huge discount, but we've never seen it cheaper.\nBelkin 3-in-1 Wireless Charger Photograph: Belkin\nThis is our top charger in our Best Apple 3-in-1 Wireless Chargers guide. With a T-shaped design that suspends two of your devices midair, it's compact enough that it won't take up too much space. You can use it to charge your iPhone (at the fastest 15-watt charging speed Apple allows), fast-charge the Apple Watch Series 7\/8\/9\/Ultra, and use the base to power up your AirPods Pro (or AirPods with a wireless charging case) simultaneously all from a single outlet. It dipped as low as $100 back in August, but this is still a great deal.\nWe like Anker's chargers and its Prime range employs GaN technology to shrink the size down. This 67-watt charger has fold-out prongs and offers two USB-C ports and one USB-A. It supports fast charging for iPhones (in addition to Pixel phones and Samsung Galaxy phones) but can also charge a MacBook.\nPhotograph: Satechi\nThis handy charger has enough power to juice up two MacBook Pro models simultaneously. But it's also great if you have a lot of devices around your desk that constantly need to be charged. It has a little stand to prop it up, a short cord that goes out to an outlet, and four USB-C ports that output 100 watts each. This is the lowest price we've tracked.\nClick the coupon button to see the discount at checkout. We recommend this Baseus charger if you're looking for a high-capacity option. With a 10,000-mAh capacity, WIRED contributor Simon Hill says it charged his iPhone 14 Pro once and then delivered an additional 64 percent the second time before tapping out. It comes with a USB-C cable too. The 6,000-mAh version is also on sale for $30 ($20 off). These deals are only applicable to Amazon Prime members.\nApple 35-Watt Dual USB-C Port Power Adapter Photograph: Apple\nIf you tend to forget to pack chargers for your devices, Apple's dual USB-C port power adapter is an essential accessory. With two USB-C ports, you can use it to recharge both your MacBook and iPhone simultaneously. Rated at 35 watts, it's also powerful enough to recharge an iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Pro.\nThis is one of our favorite MagSafe wireless chargers. It delivers the maximum 15-watt charging speed possible, sits securely on your desk, and can charge an Apple Watch too. It doesn't come with a power adapter, but it does include a USB-C-to-USB-C cable.\nIf you prefer a mount on your dash or windshield and have an iPhone 12 or later, iOttie's Velox Pro Magnetic Wireless Cooling Charger is a great option. The suction cup attaches to a windshield or dashboard pad (and proved secure in our testing) and the telescopic arm delivers a wide range of movement for the ideal position. It only maxes out at 7.5 watts for charging, but the USB-C charging cable can be removed when the iPhone is fully charged. There's also a built-in fan that helps keep the temperature down when it's hot out.\nCourant Catch:2 Photograph: Courant\nThis is a great wireless charger if you're looking for a stylish option to match your interior decor. The Belgian linen-wrapped surface comes in a variety of muted tones including camel, charcoal, forest, and natural. It can charge two devices simultaneously, but you do have to be precise when placing your phone on it. There are LED lights that show when it's charging and the rubber feet prevent the charging pad from shifting around.\nIf you need a charger for just your iPhone and AirPods, this is our favorite 2-in-1 stand. It has a MagSafe spot to charge your iPhone at top speed (up to 15 watts) and a spot below for your AirPods. It holds your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation too, which is great for StandBy mode. It's not a huge discount, but this is the lowest price we've seen.\nThis charger packs two USB-C ports, one of which can output 65 watts when used alone. If you plug two devices in, the top will deliver 45 watts and the bottom can do 20 watts. It also folds up and looks super sleek.\nSatechi Duo Wireless Charger Stand and Power Bank Photograph: Satechi\nClick the coupon button to see the full discount at checkout. The Satechi Duo combines the convenience of wireless charging with the portability of a power bank. It has a 10,000-mAh capacity (complete with LEDs to show you how much juice you have left) and can wirelessly charge both your phone and a wireless earbuds case (as long as it's Qi-certified). There's also a USB-C port to power up a third device. The only gripe we have is that it's slow\u2014delivering 10 watts of wireless charging power for phones (7.5 watts for iPhones), 5 watts for earbuds, and 10 watts via the USB-C port.\nThis travel kit from ESR works well if you want something that can prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. It can also display your Apple Watch in Nightstand mode, so you can peek and see how long before you must get out of bed. The main body folds open with a MagSafe charging pad for your iPhone and a slot behind for your AirPods. Unfortunately, it doesn't support fast charging and it's capped at 7.5 watts and 5 watts for the iPhone and Apple Watch, respectively. But it's a good, affordable charger. It dipped lower to $40 back in July, but this is still a solid deal.\nSatechi's four-port hub is a little too large, considering the number of ports you get, but there's a good reason for that. Pop off the aluminum cover and you'll find a slot for an M.2 SATA solid-state storage drive slot. That means access to an external SSD, along with two USB-A jacks, one 100-watt USB-C pass-through charging port, and a 4K HDMI at the same time. I did not have an M.2 SATA drive to test, but this 1-terabyte card should work. Just know that Satechi's hub does not support NVME M.2 cards.\nPhotograph: Otterbox\nThis is our Runner-Up pick in our guide to the Best Apple 3-in-1 Wireless Chargers. It can charge all your Apple devices at top speed and comes with a 6.6-foot cable and a 36-watt wall charger.\nApple hasn't nixed the charging adapter from its iPads yet, but it probably won't be long before you'll need to start buying your own. Or maybe you just want a spare for another room. I like this tiny adapter from Anker. The 30 watts can fast-charge the iPad Pro despite the compact size and the plug folds in, making it a nice option to take on the go.\nWhat we like best about this phone mount is that you can use it one-handed. The arms automatically close around the phone when you place it against the trigger button. To remove it, press the release bars. There's also a telescopic arm and ball joint that allows you to tweak the placement and set an ideal angle. We also love the clever magnetic tab that attaches the charging cable to the back of the mount, to keep from having to fish around for it. Plus, it's super sturdy\u2014even on bumpy roads.\nJump to a Topic: iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, Beats and AirPods, Chargers, Cases and Accessories.\nPhone Cases and Accessory Deals\nCheck out our Best MagSafe Accessories, Best iPhone 15 Cases, and Best Camera Gear For Your Smartphone guides for other picks.\nLume Cube Mobile Creator Kit 2.0 Photograph: Lume Cube\nThis kit comes with a Lume Cube light, a compact tripod (that opens up to 55 inches in length), a shotgun mic with a windscreen, and a universal phone mount with clips to attach all these accessories. It's a great and convenient all-in-one solution if you shoot content with your smartphone.\nOtterbox is the first name in super-protective phone cases, and it features in our Best Galaxy S23 Cases, Best iPhone 15 Cases, guides along with many others. Over the years, several people on the WIRED Gear Team have had and tested Otterbox cases, we can definitely speak to their reputation for durability. Otterbox also makes one of our favorite Apple 3-in-1 chargers. Everything on its site is 25 percent off.\nThis is our favorite way to mount an iPhone to a bike or scooter. Or pretty much anything that's a rod. It sits secure, and you have to pair it with a Peak Design SlimLink case for added security\u2014your MagSafe iPhone won't fly off even if you go over a deep pothole. Other MagSafe accessories from the company are also on sale, like the Car Vent Mount, which we also really like.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nApple's AirTags are a handy way to keep track of your stuff (as long as you're careful to make sure you're not being tracked without your permission). These often go on sale, but if you're itching to pick up a pack of them, now's as good a time as any.\nApple's official MagSafe case has accurate cutouts for ports, clicky buttons, and it protects the entire bottom edge of the phone. It comes in a variety of colors too. Select colors are also on sale for the iPhone 15 Pro Max for the same price.\nThis collab between the two brands brings the rugged design from Nomad's cases and the SlimLink MagSafe mount system from Peak Design. It's a great combo that gives you more security when mounting your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max.\nTired of people glancing at your display in public? The Glass Elite Privacy 360 will block anyone from seeing content on your screen from the sides. It feels great and is easy to apply too. Our only complaint is that Zagg's screen protectors are typically expensive. This has hit as low as $24, but it's a good screen protector if you need one for your iPhone 14. Other sizes (for the iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max) are also on sale.\nTotallee Thin iPhone Cases Photograph: Totallee\nYou won't get the most protection from Totallee's cases, but they're some of the thinnest on the market. It will keep your handset safe from everyday scuffs without adding too much bulk. These cases are available for a variety of iPhone models.\nIf you have an iPhone 14 or earlier, you can never own too many Lightning cables. These cables from Nomad are durable, come with the choice between USB-C and USB-A for the other end, and are available in different lengths.\nWe're fans of Incipio cases\u2014we've included them in our Best iPhones 15 Cases and Best Samsung Galaxy S23 Cases guides. For Cyber Monday, the company is offering up to 50 percent off a wide selection of cases and accessories.\nPhotograph: Zugu\nWe named this the best iPad folio case we've ever tested. Why? It's durable, with a lip around the edges of the screen that protects the expensive glass if dropped, and the buttons feel solid, yet easy to use. The magnetized cover stays securely shut, and it can be reversed to become a stand in eight different angles. Don't have a 2022 10.9-inch iPad? No problem. There are cases to fit lots of iPads, even those several years old, and most of them are also on sale.\nNever mind that it's wool\u2014it actually is easy to clean, as reviewer Brenda Stolyar found out while testing it underneath her laptop, keyboard, notebook, and coffee mug. There's a lot of real estate, and it comes in a variety of colors. It's why we called it the best overall desk mat on the market. There's a pricier version with cork on the bottom, if you think the regular, felt-bottomed version will slip around on the desk\u2014say, if you're using a glass table.\nPhotograph: Popsockets\nThis is one of our favorite MagSafe phone grips. It magnetically sticks to the back of your iPhone and you can pop out the grip for extra stability. You can just take it off to wirelessly charge your device.\nThis cable can do it all, which is why it's currently sitting at the top of our Best USB-C Cables guide. It can deliver 100 watts, transfer data at up to 40 Gbps, and serve an 8K display (or two 4K displays). It supports DisplayPort Alt Mode (DP Alt Mode), USB Power Delivery (USB-PD), and PPS, and it is backward-compatible with all earlier standards. It's pricey, even with the discount, but it rarely dips this low. This is also the longest size; the shorter one is also on sale.\nThe Creator Kit acts as the link between your phone and various mounting solutions. It comes with a magnetic locking mount that works with the Peak Design SlimLink phone case and a few different mounting options including a Peak Design Arca quick-release plate, a GoPro mount adapter, and a 1\/4-inch tripod mount. That way, you can easily mount it on almost any tripod. Your phone (with the case protecting it) will slot easily into the SlimLink mount and stay secure.\nWhat About iPhone Deals?\nYou typically won't see many iPhone deals. Those sales usually come from carriers like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, and have several requirements, like being on an unlimited plan or opening a new cell line.

{"title":"UFC 295 predictions, best bets, odds: Tom Aspinall, Mackenzie Dern among top picks to consider","context":"## UFC 295 predictions, best bets, odds: Tom Aspinall, Mackenzie Dern among top picks to consider\n\nUFC 295 took a hit when heavyweight champion Jon Jones suffered an injury that forced him out of his planned title defense against Stipe Miocic. Despite the loss of the planned main event, the card features some compelling and evenly-matched fights, including a pair of championship bouts on top when the promotion returns to Madison Square Garden in New York.\nIn the main event, the vacant light heavyweight title is up for grabs when former champion Jiri Prochazka clashes with former middleweight champion Alex Pereira. Prochazka never lost the belt but was forced to vacate due to a shoulder injury. An injury to Jamahal Hill, who won the title after Prochazka vacated, left the belt up for grabs once again, setting up this bout that sees Pereira as a slight -115 favorite.\n\"I'm not going into this fight with mixed emotions about vengeance. I don't want to play that game,\" Pereira told CBS Sports this week. \"I want to go with a very positive mindset. I'm going to fight with the mindset that they haven't even fought before. But looking into the other side of being able to bring Glover his belt back and put it back in the gym, that means a lot to me.\"\nThe pair of heavyweights set to clash could usher in the new era of the division. Sergei Pavlovich and Tom Aspinall are both vicious finishers with neither man going beyond the six-minute mark of a fight in their UFC careers. Because of their immense power and skills, the fight is a virtual pick'em at the betting window.\nCan't get enough boxing and MMA?

As always, we are looking at each main card fight to identify the \"best bet\" for each bout. After a 2-2 result at UFC 294, our record for the year now stands at an even 28-28.\nLet's take a look at what we've identified as our choices for the best bets on the UFC 295 pay-per-view main card.\nCBS Sports will also have live coverage of the fight with round-by-round scoring and blow-by-blow updates to keep you up to date throughout the night.\nDiego Lopes vs. Pat Sabatini\nPat Sabatini moneyline (-115)\nThis is a sticky fight to me. According to the odds, both men are most likely to win by submission, which makes sense given that both have 12 submission victories on their resume. Where it gets tricky is that neither man has a submission loss, so they've both been dominant in applying their grappling. Lopes is a bit more dangerous on his feet but Sabatini has the better wrestling and can probably impose his will to force the fight to the ground. The question is whether either man can trap the other in a submission once Sabatini puts the fight on the floor. The odds suggest the fight won't go the distance (-190) but I'm not so sure this doesn't become a three-round grind on the ground, so we'll go with the slight favorite to score the win on the strength of his wrestling.\nMatt Frevola vs. Benoit Saint-Denis\nUnder 1.5 rounds (-143)\nAfter four of his first five fights in the UFC went to decision, Frevola has not seen the second round in his four most recent bouts. Three of Saint-Denis' five UFC bouts have checked in at under 1.5 rounds. The matchup iis a good mix of fighters looking to find a quick finish. If you want a slightly higher risk, Saint-Denis is +155 to win by KO, TKO or DQ. Frevola has two knockout losses on his ledger, one in an even one minute and the other in just seven seconds. Saint-Denis can finish fights quickly and Frevola has gotten drubbed out of fights fast in the past.\nMackenzie Dern vs. Jessica Andrade\nMackenzie Dern to win by submission (+115)\nThis is Andrade's fifth fight in 2023. That usually indicates a fighter is on a good run and looking to continue their momentum. Instead, Andrade has lost her three most recent fights, all by stoppage. Dern is an incredibly accomplished submission grappler and won four of her first seven UFC fights by submission. The submissions haven't been coming for Dern as of late, however, with a 2-2 run in her four most recent outings, all going to the judges' scorecards. Andrade has four submission losses in her career, two of which came during her current three-fight skid. This feels like the perfect fight for Dern to get back to basics and dominate on the ground before finishing with a submission.\nSergei Pavlovich vs. Tom Aspinall\nTom Aspinall moneyline (-120)\nYou have to go all the way back to June 2017 to find a Pavlovich fight that went past the opening round. In fact, only three of his 19 career fights have hit the five-minute mark and he has five wins that came in less than one minute. Not to be outdone, Aspinall has six fights that ended in less than one minute and three that went past the opening round. This all adds up to a wild situation where this interim heavyweight championship fight has +500 odds for the fight ending in the first minute of the fight, the \"favorite\" of the time of finish lines. The fight going past 1.5 rounds is +165, which is somewhat appealing since this is a five-round fight and it would make sense for both men to not dump their entire tank on chasing a quick finish. Still, Aspinall's more diverse game makes his moneyline a slightly more appealing bet.\nJiri Prochazka vs. Alex Pereira\nOver 1.5 rounds (-150)\nOnly three of Prochazka and Pereira's nine UFC fights have ended in under 1.5 rounds. Both men are dynamic and dangerous, with the ability to finish a fight in a flash. Still, both men are also tough as nails and highly skilled. In such an even fight, it's hard to throw a bet at either man straight up or any method of finish unless you feel you have a truly good read on the bout. I don't have that feeling, but I do think the fight happens at a high pace and lasts more than one and a half rounds before either man takes over or gets the finish. Barring someone landing an early bomb, this feels like the best available line for the fight.\nWho wins UFC 295: Prochazka vs. Pereira, and how exactly does each fight end?

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size It all started with a car full of booze and a bear costume. Owen Teale, recently suspended from his sixth-form college for organising a riotous Christmas party for fellow students, was in need of a job. \u201cThey held an investigation into the party and I was the first to be called in,\u201d says the 62-year-old Welsh actor best known as gimlet-eyed master-at-arms Ser Alliser Thorne in Game of Thrones. \u201cThey\u2019d found the empty bottles and people were falling over drunk. I said, \u2018yeah, I did it. It was me. I borrowed my mother\u2019s car, loaded it up with booze and smuggled it in\u2019.\u201d Teale had no intention of joining his father at the limestone quarry that fed the steel works at Port Talbot. He wanted to escape South Wales, to find a bigger world. Which is when fate \u2013 or rather a kindly teacher called Mr Davies \u2013 intervened. He suggested Teale might find work at Barry Island Pleasure Park, a fairground near Cardiff. \u201cAt the time, it was a rust bucket of a big wheel and one big dipper,\u201d recalls Teale. \u201cBut I went along and auditioned. I was hoping to be a magician\u2019s assistant or something like that, but they said \u2018you\u2019d be great as the bear. Here\u2019s the costume\u2019.\u201d Game of Thrones star Owen Teale will play Scrooge in a Melbourne season of A Christmas Carol. Credit: Jay Brooks The role of Barry the Bear was deceptively hard. \u201cHis remit was to wander around the park greeting visitors, but you could only do an hour at a time because you sweated so much. I wore pyjamas under the costume to absorb the sweat, but it would fill the rubber hands. After a while, I\u2019d get bored, sit on the big wheel and go round and round.\u201d The sight of a disconsolate, sweaty bear riding the ferris wheel caught management\u2019s attention and Teale was sacked. At which point a couple of his co-workers \u2013 students from the Guildford School of Acting \u2013 suggested he audition at their alma mater. He was accepted, awarded a study grant and Barry the Bear got a ticket out of Wales.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI was going nowhere really. If I hadn\u2019t met those two young women I don\u2019t know what would have happened,\u201d says Teale. \u201cBut there have been so many points in my career, moments of pure chance, when things went my way. And if you can survive the moments when things don\u2019t go your way, you can make it.\u201d If you\u2019re not a diehard Game of Thrones fan, Teale\u2019s name may not be familiar. But his pale face, intense eyes and imposing physicality \u2013 he\u2019s 188cm in his socks \u2013 will be. The Welsh character actor is a Zelig-like figure whose frequent stage and screen appearances invariably guarantee two things: the tale will be well told and bad stuff is going to happen. He\u2019s in Leeds when we speak, visiting his younger daughter Gracie, 21, who\u2019s studying art and design at the city\u2019s university. Eliza, 25, his other daughter with actor wife Sylvestra Le Touzel, is following in her parents\u2019 footsteps. His son, Ion, from his first marriage, recently made him a grandfather. Owen Teale and his wife, Sylvestra Le Touzel, at the sixth-season premiere of Game of Thrones in Hollywood. Credit: Getty Images Loading Earlier today, he was in Edinburgh shooting scenes for the second season of the supernatural TV thriller The Rig. His character Lars Hutton, an irascible bully and the man most likely to be chucked off the oil rig, has somehow made it back for the next instalment of the Amazon Prime drama. Hutton, Thorne and Chief Inspector Philip Osborne, another textbook bully who first appeared in the opening season of the BBC police procedural Line of Duty, are just three of the menacing characters he\u2019s played in recent times. Peter Knox, a villainous sorcerer in A Discovery of Witches, the fantasy TV series based on books by Deborah Harkness, is another.\nAdvertisement\nWhen he portrays Ebenezer Scrooge in an upcoming Melbourne production of Jack Thorne\u2019s award-winning adaptation of Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol, he\u2019ll summon the same forces to make the archetypal miser utterly convincing. The truth is this: the avuncular man in the amber-coloured spectacles and leather jacket chatting to me on the line from Leeds is a master of darkness. When Ser Alliser Thorne drove a dagger into the heart of Game of Thrones\u2019 Byronic hero Jon Snow in the final episode of Season 5, he left the show\u2019s 10 million viewers in a profound state of shock. \u201cIt\u2019s true, I have started to play a lot of dark characters,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cAnd at first it was a great challenge because I\u2019m quite a sociable fellow.\u201d So, how does he find that darkness? \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of nothingness. In all honesty, I\u2019m not very good at being completely on my own,\u201d he explains. \u201cI come alive when I\u2019m with other people. So staying in hotel rooms away from my family isn\u2019t great and it doesn\u2019t get any easier. There\u2019s something empty and a bit scary within me when I\u2019m not with people. I think that\u2019s where that stuff comes from.\u201d Owen Teale unleashes the darkness as Ser Alliser Thorne in Game of Thrones. His ability to tap into the void served him well as he prepared to enact the murder of Snow, played by Kit Harington. \u201cThere was Kit \u2026 who was so beautiful. And he\u2019s such a lovely man. By connecting to this feeling of emptiness, of having nothing inside of me, I was able to look at him and everything he had - his looks, his grace - and feel pure hatred. For all of Ser Alliser\u2019s explanations [for the murder], deep down he just has a hatred of Jon Snow\u2019s popularity and gifts.\u201d Like Iago, I suggest. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cVery like Iago.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhen Snow\u2019s death was broadcast, Teale braced himself for the fall-out. He imagined being confronted by irate Game of Thrones fans who would hate him for \u201ckilling the goodness\u201d. Instead, he was asked for endless selfies and impromptu recitations of Thorne catchphrases such as \u201cFor the Watch!\u201d or \u201cBas-terd!\u201d Once, a drunk emerged from a restaurant and stumbled towards Teale brandishing a knife. The actor braced himself, but the man simply wanted \u201cSer Alliser\u201d to hold the utensil to his throat for a photo. On a visit to Uluru with his family, the tour guide caught sight of his face and exclaimed, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d Says Teale, \u201cHe just kept staring at me and I realised it was an Alliser Thorne thing. I said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to kill anyone, I\u2019m just an actor\u2019. But it clearly troubled him that this person who had committed this awful crime had suddenly appeared.\u201d Teale has the grace to admit he enjoys this new level of celebrity. \u201cPeople seem to realise that without the darkness of people like Ser Alliser, Jon Snow couldn\u2019t have shone as brightly as he did.\u201d Owen Teale with Clare Homan in The Fifteen Streets. Credit: ABC He was well into his 50s when he landed his highest profile role, but it would be wrong to think of Teale as a late starter. In 1989, not long out of drama school, he starred in the hit television adaptation of Catherine Cookson\u2019s romance The Fifteen Streets. The cast included Sean Bean, another young working-class actor, who went on to become a leading man in Hollywood before playing Ned Stark in Game of Thrones. I ask Teale if he ever wishes he\u2019d followed Bean\u2019s trajectory. \u201cOh god, yeah,\u201d he replies. \u201cAbsolutely. You instinctively think [playing leading men] will lead to feelings of success. But it never came my way. My cut of my jib wasn\u2019t quite right. It\u2019s about what your face does on screen I guess.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThere have been opportunities to step into the spotlight over the years. When The Fifteen Streets attracted a massive TV audience in Britain, Teale was offered a lead role in a movie playing a bare knuckle fighter. But the financing fell through and he signed up for a four-year stint with the Royal Shakespeare Company instead. Years later, a producer offered him the lead in a big film being shot in Britain, but the money men demanded an American star and William Hurt got the gig. When Teale won a Tony Award in 1997 for his performance in Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House, he was told he needed to spend time in Hollywood wooing producers. He decided to fly home to his family in London instead. \u201cMy wife was about to give birth, so I said \u2018I\u2019m off\u2019. I\u2019m sure part of it was I just didn\u2019t believe that I was going to waltz into leading man roles in Hollywood.\u201d And there it is, that ambivalence. Despite all the plaudits, the awards and the steady offers of work, you sense Teale has never been certain of his gifts. It\u2019s probably why he\u2019s so consistently good \u2013 complacency isn\u2019t in his nature. Owen Teale with Toni Collette in Dream Horse: \u201cToni just raised my game,\u201d he says. Credit: AP He\u2019s far better at recognising brilliance in others. For example, Toni Collette, who he worked with on Dream Horse, a 2020 movie about an unlikely champion racehorse. \u201cToni just raised my game. That\u2019s a huge talent, huge,\u201d he says, shaking his head in wonder. \u201cI recently received an award from BAFTA for the film and part of me thinks they should give it to Toni.\u201d He\u2019s happiest in a room full of actors working on a play, a film or a TV production. \u201cWhat turns me on is the thought of collaborating with talented people. I\u2019m very sociable with the rest of the company and fully intend to do that when I come to Melbourne.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article, authored by Richard Jinman, was published by The Sydney Morning Herald on 2023-10-20 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":578}
{"title":"Subtle as a sledgehammer, a pop icon returns","context":"## Subtle as a sledgehammer, a pop icon returns\n\nTate McRae\u2019s career, until recently, had a stench of desperation about it. That\u2019s a wild thing to say about someone who\u2019s only 20, but how else to describe the feeling you get watching an artist who trades explicitly in classic pop moves failing to grab the mode such musical expression necessitates, ie: popularity? Tate McRae\u2019s Think Later: a second stab at superstardom. Despite her age, the Calgary-born musician\u2019s already had a journey. A professionally trained dancer since 6, at 13 she finished third on the US version of So You Think You Can Dance and attracted record label attention with songs uploaded to YouTube. In 2020, her weeper You Broke Me First had a chart moment, leading to her debut I Used To Think I Can Fly in 2022, an intriguing album of thrashy bangers and post-Billie Eilish sad-pop featuring production from pop titans Greg Kurstin (Adele) and Finneas (Eilish). It had at least one could\u2019ve been smash \u2013 the spiky What Would You Do? \u2013 but, fairly listless despite her swaggering delivery, it failed to ignite with either mainstream audiences or pop aesthetes. But then, this past August, Greedy happened. Used in a video by popular TikToker Tube Girl and then in countless hair-flip transition clips, the song went viral, eventually amassing over 320 million streams globally, topping charts internationally, and becoming McRae\u2019s proper breakthrough and a rare reintroduction. It even landed her a slot on Saturday Night Live, that pop superstar rite-of-passage, and sold out shows for her upcoming Australian tour next November. That Greedy\u2019s the thing that\u2019s pushed McRae to the next level is somewhat confounding. Is it even a good song? It\u2019s not particularly memorable, and McRae\u2019s debut had better tracks that slipped listeners by. But its sassy sentiment \u2013 \u201cI would want myself\u201d, particularly suited to clips of youthful coming-of-age expression \u2013 clearly caught on with the TikTok crowd, which is how pop stardom happens these days. In another popstar move, McRae also channelled an alter ego (Tatiana, who\u2019s \u201cballsy, loud and obnoxious\u201d) for Greedy\u2019s vibrant music video, a fun throwback to choreographed Y2K-era aesthetics \u2013 McRae dancing all lustily on a Zamboni (so Canadian) \u2013 which surely helped.\nIn this context comes Think Later, McRae\u2019s sophomore release. Almost completely produced and co-written with Ryan Tedder (OneRepublic), it sports his hit-making trademarks, for better or worse \u2013 pristine songcraft hooked around off-kilter concepts that can\u2019t help but catch the ear, but punishingly midtempo, songs searching for gravitas over, say, fun. For an album that\u2019s supposed to be McRae\u2019s bold, confident, cheeky makeover, parts of it lack spark. Tellingly, the best songs on the album \u2013 Exes, Hurt My Feelings and Guilty Conscience \u2013 follow the Greedy template: skittering Timbaland-style beats recalling Y2K-era pop, all syncopated and staccato and sultry kiss-offs to dumb boys. They feel strong and personally nostalgic \u2013 like McRae\u2019s nodding to her countrywoman Nelly Furtado\u2019s classic mid-\u201900s run \u2013 but driven by McRae\u2019s playfulness. We\u2019re Not Alike shows another promising side to McRae\u2019s sound, a post-punky thing built on an Interpol-ish riff that slyly builds into something anthemic, recalling her pal Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s sleeper Guts track, Pretty Isn\u2019t Pretty (the post-punk revival has officially returned to pop, it seems). That these songs are so interesting makes the album\u2019s overemphasis on understated ballads frustrating. Songs like opener Cut My Hair, Grave and Stay Done are slick but dour affairs, the classic Tedder formula. Messier, which weirdly is not another Canadian nod to ice hockey great Mark, shows McRae has the range, a bitter ballad where she allows her vocals to get raw and unhinged.\nBut the real pleasure of Think Later lies in McRae\u2019s idiosyncrasies and their potential; she\u2019s a throwback in the classic singing-dancing Britney mould. With a pop landscape led by serious singer-songwriters like Taylor Swift, SZA, Rodrigo and Eilish; Dua \u201cgo girl, give us nothing\u201d Lipa; the fame-trolling Doja Cat; and the introverted to the point of obscurity PinkPantheress, there\u2019s a vacancy for McRae\u2019s particular set of popstar skills. If she\u2019s greedy enough, the platform feels like it\u2019s hers to grab. Robert Moran I\/O, Peter Gabriel For a guy who spent much of the \u201970s at the forefront of prog-rock as the singer for Genesis, creating sprawling concept albums, wearing a series of increasingly bizarre stage outfits that suggested he had ingested a truckload of acid on the way to a Halloween party, and being one of the main reasons punk had to happen, Peter Gabriel sure did go on to personify big, shiny \u201980s pop. The most played video on MTV? That would be Sledgehammer, his body slam of a hit from 1986 that did just what it said on the tin. The song blaring from that boombox John Cusack held aloft under Ione Skye\u2019s window in the iconic scene from 1989\u2019s Say Anything? That would be Gabriel\u2019s In Your Eyes. And, somewhat bizarrely, you can barely watch an old episode of Miami Vice without hearing a Gabriel song in the background. After two decades, Peter Gabriel returns \u2013 overcooked and overlong.\nFrom popularising the massive, heavily gated drum sound that dominated the era to becoming one of world music\u2019s greatest champions by co-founding the WOMAD festival, for a while there Gabriel was seemingly everywhere. And then\u2026 he wasn\u2019t. In fact, I\/O is his first solo album of new original material in over two decades. Some wags are calling it his Chinese Democracy, but the rarely punctual Axl Rose only took a comparatively brisk 18 years to finally release the follow-up to Use Your Illusion. Some things haven\u2019t changed. From the get-go, on opening track Panopticom, there\u2019s that gunshots-in-an-echo-chamber drum sound and the instantly recognisable fat, slithering tones of long-time bassist Tony Levin. And the subject matter is the familiar, big-world thinking we\u2019ve come to expect, too \u2013 in this case, Gabriel\u2019s utopian idea of an infinitely expandable and accessible world database, but, you know, one that doesn\u2019t peddle untruths. The title track could almost come from Coldplay, with its singalong chorus designed for arena crowds waving lit-up smartphones, while Gabriel sings \u201cstuff coming out, stuff going in, I\u2019m just a part of everything\u201d.\nIn the late \u201990s, Gabriel collaborated with Randy Newman on That\u2019ll Do from the Babe soundtrack. Should Newman be indisposed for the next Pixar film soundtrack, Gabriel\u2019s Playing For Time could easily slot in for that reflective, tear-inducing, life-affirming ballad Newman routinely provides for the end of the second act. In fact, there\u2019s a palpable sense of mortality on I\/O. Gabriel is 73, and he\u2019s mining a seam of material here about taking stock, feeling at one with the world and the (admittedly, not exactly original) realisation that love is all we need. This reaches its most intense moment in And Still, a song he wrote to deal with the death of his mother in 2016. It\u2019s a fragile, delicate thing that has an almost Nick Drake transparency to it, as he remembers leaning his head against her skin and the feeling of her brushing his hair as a young boy. But with all that time spent cooking up these songs, some have been left in the oven too long, stretching to five, six, seven minutes, and in need of an edit or at least a change in tempo. Olive Tree and Live and Let Live overload the \u201cone with the world\u201d barrow he\u2019s pushing \u2013 the former, a Sting-like concoction that seems to be two different songs bolted together; the latter, coming from a fine place (inspired by Nelson Mandela and The Elders project) but littered with cliches such as \u201cWhen we can forgive, we can move on\u201d and \u201cAn eye for an eye, again and again, until the whole world is blind\u201d. On top of all this, there are two mixes of the album, one a \u201cbright-side mix\u201d by Mark \u201cSpike\u201d Stent, and the other a \u201cdark-side mix\u201d by Tchad Blake. Yes, it\u2019s a lot to take in. But then, it\u2019s been a while in the making. And who knows when, or if, we\u2019ll get a follow-up?

Verdane, a Norwegian private equity firm that earlier this year closed a $1 billion+ fund to make investments in scaling tech companies, is taking an 11% stake in Meltwater, at a company valuation of \u20ac542 million ($592 million), valuing the stake at around $65 million. But that\u2019s not the only deal that is going down with this transaction.\nThe investment is coming by way of Verdane taking a substantial stake in Fountain Venture, the investment vehicle controlled by the founder and current chairman of Meltwater, J\u00f8rn Lyseggen.\nMeltwater, until earlier this year, was traded publicly on the Norwegian stock exchange. Lyseggen oversaw the company going private again earlier this year in a deal with two private equity firms, Altor and Marlin, and held his remaining share via Fountain. (The take-private deal was the last disclosed valuation and the one that Meltwater currently cites.) Verdane invested in Fountain Venture rather than directly in Meltwater because the plan will be to partner with Fountain to make future investments together in startups working in areas like AI.\nJoakim Kjemperud, a principal at Verdane, said the deal also gives his firm a stake in an HR firm, Jobylon, although Meltwater is by far the bigger asset.\n\u201cThe deal here is that it\u2019s very much a portfolio transaction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re buying into J\u00f8rn\u2019s investment company and acquiring an implied direct stake in Meltwater and Nordic HR firm Jobylon, but Meltwater is the biggest asset in the portfolio.\u201d Jobylon\u2019s ARR right now is around \u20ac5 million, while the ARR for Meltwater \u2014 which was founded in Norway but now calls San Francisco its headquarters \u2014 is around \u20ac500 million, he added.\nThe deal underscores a couple of important themes in the world of European tech and VC.\nThe first of these is the fact that tech companies continue to see huge pressure on their valuations. Meltwater\u2019s current market cap of just under $600 million is actually less than the company raised over the years when it was a privately held startup (over $700 million, per PitchBook data), and less than half of its valuation when it went public in December 2020 at over $1 billion.\nThe second is the nature of dealmaking at the moment and the efforts that investors are making to de-risk. The market is particularly tight at the moment in Europe: VC firm Atomico\u2019s annual deep dive into the funding landscape in Europe (which it puts together with a number of third-party research firms and particpation from others in the ecosystem) found that funding in 2023 halved to just $43 billion, and private equity firms are making a much bigger appearance in deals to make up some of the drop from VC.\nIn that context, it\u2019s notable that Verdane opted to invest in Fountain Venture rather than directly in Meltwater. That will give Verdane not only the stake in Meltwater, but also a stake in Jobylon and whatever else Fountain and Lyseggen find interesting. That will, in turn, de-leverage a focus on just one business. Verdane itself has only recently started to spread its wings to invest in startups across all of Europe and beyond: tying up with a partner to help direct it is a very de-risked approach to take while trying to be more ambitious.\nIn terms of technology, companies like Meltwater are at a crossroads these days. The company would have had its roots out of the businesses where humans would have physically sifted through piles of newspapers, daily, to clip mentions of a company\u2019s name, collate those and send them on to those clients to help them better track how they are being covered in the media.\nThe decline of print media digitized that effort, and then the rise of social media turned that into a wider game, sentiment analysis, and words became structured, and more usually unstructured data. The influx of a whole new set of tools to glean insight out of that data turned a media challenge into a technical one. Meltwater built AI in-house and has acquired a stream of businesses in an analytics consolidation play. (The most high-profile of these acquisitions undoubtedly was DataSift, the groundbreaking firm that was an early friend of Twitter\u2019s in monetizing its firehose only for that relationship to turn sour.)\nBut now, it has a much bigger competitive threat: Companies like OpenAI and innovations in generative AI will change the game again in terms of search \u2014 consumer and enterprise \u2014 and how any kind of business intelligence work gets carried out.\nLyseggen, unsurprisingly, believes that although Meltwater\u2019s focus feels a bit like a throwback to a problem that has now essentially been fixed \u2014 and may well be made more efficient by would-be competitors \u2014 he thinks there is more opportunity for his company regardless.\n\u201cI consider OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT the \u2018Netscape moment\u2019 in ushering in this new era,\u201d he said. That\u2019s an interesting thing to say: Netscape certainly changed how the world looks for information, although it\u2019s far from being part of what we use today. \u201cAI is changing the game for players to challenge the old guard. I think Meltwater\u2019s tech stock is already the most modern and AI-centric in its category. We will continue to invest in AI and that\u2019s something we are very excited about. We are pushing very hard.\u201d Meltwater today says it analyzes around 1 billion documents daily for clients in communications, marketing and PR.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-18 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":580}
{"title":"Earnings week ahead: DocuSign, NIO, Broadcom, GameStop and more","context":"## Earnings week ahead: DocuSign, NIO, Broadcom, GameStop and more\n\nThe first full week of December features several significant companies slated to announce their quarterly results. These earnings releases hold considerable implications for various sectors, including energy, software, retail, autos and semiconductors.\nAmong the companies scheduled to release financial figures are NIO (NYSE:NIO), GameStop (NYSE:GME), DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT), Dollar General (NYSE:DG), C3.ai (NYSE:AI) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Additionally, reports are expected from Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB), AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), Signet (NYSE:SIG) and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY).\nBelow is a curated list of earnings due in the weeks of December 4 to December 8:\nMonday, December 4\nGitLab Inc. (GTLB) is due to post its Q3 results after the market closes on Monday. With a 10% surge in the stock this year, Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system suggests a Hold, expressing concerns about valuation. This contrasts with Wall Street analysts, who advocate a Buy rating.\nRecently, Raymond James has rated the stock with a Market Perform rating, citing potential market exuberance and growth potential in fiscal 2025 due to a large total addressable market, healthy customers, and a value proposition favoring consolidation over fragmentation.\nOn the other hand, Cantor Fitzgerald started coverage with an Overweight rating and a $55 price target, as the company anticipates benefits from product consolidation and the generative artificial intelligence wave.\nConsensus EPS Estimates: -$0.01\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $141.04M\nEarnings Insight: GitLab has beaten EPS and revenue expectations in 8 straight quarters.\nAlso reporting: Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Fusion Fuel Green PLC (HTOO), IDT Corporation (IDT), JOANN (JOAN), RGC Resources(RGCO), and more.\nTuesday, December 5\nNIO (NIO)\nNIO (NIO) is all set to release its Q3 earnings before the bell on Tuesday. The Wall Street consensus remains at Buy, while Seeking Alpha\u2019s Quant Ratings maintain a Hold rating on the stock due to concerns about profitability and valuation.\nOn Friday, the EV maker announced that deliveries rose 12.6% Y\/Y but dipped roughly 1% M\/M to 15,959 vehicles in November.\nStone Fox Capital, an SA Investing Group leader, notes that NIO's stock has fallen below $8, attributing the move to fluctuating monthly delivery numbers and inconsistent EV deliveries. Despite achieving an electric vehicle delivery record in Q3, the recent 10% workforce reduction raises concerns for Q4, Stone Fox Capital noted. The stock is currently trading at its 2023 lows, but the analyst sees potential for a doubling to $16.\nConsensus EPS Estimates: -$0.23\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $2.66B\nEarnings Insight: NIO has missed EPS estimates consistently in the past 8 quarters and revenue expectations in 50% of those quarters.\nAlso reporting: MongoDB (MDB), SentinelOne (S), Asana (ASAN), The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM), AutoZone (AZO), Stitch Fix (SFIX), Box (BOX), AeroVironment (AVAV), Yext (YEXT), Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG), Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY), Ocuphire Pharma (OCUP), Hovnanian Enterprises (HOV), Designer Brands (DBI), HealthEquity (HQY), Ferguson (FERG), G-III Apparel Group (GIII), The Descartes Systems Group (DSGX), Phreesia (PHR), Core & Main (CNM), J.Jill (JILL), Daktronics (DAKT), Lands' End (LE), and more.\nWednesday, December 6\nGameStop (GME)\nVideo game retailer GameStop (GME) is scheduled to post its Q3 earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. Analysts expect losses to narrow Y\/Y with relatively flat revenue.\nOver the past 5 days, GameStop stock has experienced a surge of over 20% amid the recent volatility in one-time meme stocks. BTIG technical strategist Jonathan Krinsky attributes this upward trend to renewed buying interest in this group.\nWall Street analysts recommend selling GME stock, whereas Seeking Alpha's Quant rating system advises a Hold.\nSeeking Alpha author Josh Arnold writes, \"GameStop faces fundamental headwinds, including poor margins and declining sales, making it a structurally unprofitable company.\"\nConsensus EPS Estimates: -$0.08\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $1.18B\nEarnings Insight: GameStop has beaten EPS estimates in only 3 of the past 8 quarters and revenue expectations in 5 of those reports.\nAlso reporting: ChargePoint Holdings (CHPT), C3.ai (AI), Veeva Systems (VEEV), Chewy (CHWY), Campbell Soup Company (CPB), Toll Brothers (TOL), Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B), Powell Industries (POWL), United Natural Foods (UNFI), Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), Semtech Corporation (SMTC), Braze (BRZE), Verint Systems (VRNT), Sprinklr (CXM), Argan (AGX), Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings (SPWH), Korn Ferry (KFY), John Wiley & Sons (WLY), Amtech Systems (ASYS), Couchbase (BASE), Vera Bradley (VRA), Barnes & Noble Education (BNED), Oxford Industries (OXM), and more.\nThursday, December 7\nDocuSign (DOCU)\nOnline signature company DocuSign (DOCU) is scheduled to release its Q3 results on Thursday following the closing bell. After surpassing expectations in Q2, the company guided Q3 revenue to between $687M and $691M and boosted its full-year sales guidance to $2.73B to $2.74B from prior expectations of $2.71B and $2.73B. Seeking Alpha author The Asian Investor points out that DocuSign's net dollar retention rate is decreasing and top-line growth is slowing. A drop below 100% could potentially trigger a negative stock catalyst, the analyst argued, as shares have historically been volatile after earnings. Wall Street analysts are adopting a cautious stance on the stock with a Hold rating, in contrast to the optimistic recommendation of a Buy from Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system. Consensus EPS Estimates: $0.63\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $690.12M\nEarnings Insight: The company has beaten EPS estimates in 7 of the past 8 quarters and revenue in 100% of those reports. Broadcom (AVGO) Broadcom (AVGO) is set to announce its Q4 results after Thursday's closing bell. The California-based semiconductor company has seen its shares surge over 67% this year, fueled by the AI wave. This growth far outpaces the broader market, underscoring the company's robust position and resilience in the current economic climate. On Friday, Broadcom announced plans to let go of 1,300 California-based VMware employees following the completion of its multi-billion-dollar acquisition of VMware on November 22, marking a significant step in its $61B cash-and-stock diversification strategy from semiconductors to the cloud. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, a report surfaced that Broadcom (AVGO) is evaluating strategic alternatives for VMware's End-User Computing and Carbon Black cybersecurity units. The consensus rating among sell-side analysts maintains a Buy stance, while Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system transitioned to Strong Buy from Hold in mid-November. SA author Mike Zaccardi believes that Broadcom offers tech and AI exposure at a lower price, with a strong semiconductor product portfolio and solid technical background. With earnings beat history, strong expense control, and robust profitability, it's an attractive investment, he contended. Consensus EPS Estimates: $10.96\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $9.28B\nEarnings Insight: Broadcom has beaten EPS and revenue estimates in 8 consecutive quarters. Also reporting: Lululemon Athletica (LULU), Dollar General Corporation (DG), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), Smartsheet (SMAR), Vail Resorts (MTN), Planet Labs PBC (PL), Guidewire Software (GWRE), The Cooper Companies (COO), HashiCorp (HCP), Lakeland Industries (LAKE), Greif (GEF), Liquidity Services (LQDT), GMS (GMS), Methode Electronics (MEI), Hooker Furnishings Corporation (HOFT), DLH Holdings (DLHC), SecureWorks (SCWX), and more.\nFriday, December 8\nHello Group (NASDAQ:MOMO) will release its Q3 earnings results before the opening bell on Friday. Following upbeat Q2 results, the company saw a softer Q3 and anticipated a drop in revenues of 10.3% to 7.2% Y\/Y.\nThe Seeking Alpha's Quant Ratings moved to a Hold recommendation just days before the earnings announcement. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts maintain a Buy rating on the stock.\nIndividual Trader, a Seeking Alpha author, suggests that MOMO's recent downtrend may be concluding, pointing to signs of a bottom forming. The analyst added that the combination of cheap earnings and a high dividend yield makes it an appealing investment option.\nConsensus EPS Estimates: $0.35\nConsensus Revenue Estimates: $413.43M\nEarnings Insight: The company has a track record of beating EPS and revenue estimates in 7 of the past 8 quarters.\nAlso reporting: Johnson Outdoors (JOUT), Canadian Western Bank (OTCPK:CBWBF), and more.\n\nThis article was published by Seeking Alpha on 2023-12-03 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":581}
{"title":"Looking for a book to read? Here are 14 tips for October","context":"## Looking for a book to read? Here are 14 tips for October\n\nKilling for Country: A Family Story\nDavid Marr, Black Inc., $32.99. October 3 How would you feel if, while doing a bit of genealogical research, you discovered that you were descended from professional killers of Aboriginal people? If you\u2019re someone such as David Marr, who has \u201cbeen writing about the politics of race all my life. I know what side I\u2019m on\u201d, it prompts this confronting investigation of the Native Police and his family connections through his great-great-grandfather. He describes it as \u201can act of atonement, of penance by storytelling\u201d. It\u2019s a timely, vital story.\nUnfinished Woman\nRobyn Davidson, Bloomsbury, $34.99. October 3 You\u2019ve read the book, you\u2019ve seen the film \u2013 Tracks \u2013 but here is the story of Robyn Davidson\u2019s life from childhood, largely avoiding that trip across the desert with her camels, and beyond to a life of more travel, houses, lovers and family. Particularly family, and particularly her mother, who took her own life at 46 and about whom Davidson has been unable previously to write to her own satisfaction. She is acutely aware that her version of the truth \u201ccan bury another\u2019s\u201d, but this one is hers.\nStone Yard Devotional\nCharlotte Wood, Allen & Unwin, $32.99. October 3 Another reckoning with a mother\u2019s death, this time in a novel from the sure hands of Charlotte Wood. A woman arrives at some sort of religious community having turned her back on her husband, their life and the metropolis. What is she fleeing and what are her demons? It\u2019s not all peace and tranquillity in the community, which has collective crises to deal with, while her previous life won\u2019t leave her alone. Written in a spare prose, the consistently brilliant Wood delivers yet again. Will Murdoch help Trump again? Credit: The New York Times\nThe Fall: The End of the Murdoch Empire\nMichael Wolff, The Bridge Street Press, $34.99. Out now One thing you can be sure of in a Michael Wolff book is plenty of controversial detail and quotes that are not always fully substantiated and sourced. The American writer has tackled the Donald Trump White House in three books, and now turns his attention back to Rupert Murdoch, about whom he has already written a couple. In this latest volume, he turns his blowtorch on Fox News and the recently retired Murdoch, two players who had massive roles in getting Trump into power. Next year? Surely not.\nMy Life as a Jew\nMichael Gawenda, Scribe, $35. October 3 The former Age editor-in-chief, a left-wing secular Jew, has written a powerful, moving and personal exploration of his roots and the meaning of his life in Australia today \u2013 \u201cthe Jew I was, the Jew I am, and the Jew I am becoming\u201d. It begins with a frank account of why he ended his long friendship with former publisher Louise Adler over an essay she commissioned about the so-called Israel Lobby, and a public letter about coverage of Israel. But there is much more \u2013 memoir, history and literature \u2013 in this brave book. Laura Jean McKay has written a new book of short stories. Credit: Brendan Lodge\nGunflower: Stories\nLaura Jean McKay, Scribe, $29.99. October 3 Laura Jean McKay won the richest writing prize in the country during the pandemic for her timely novel The Animals in that Country about a virulent virus that allowed infected people to understand what animals were saying. She was quickly called prescient, but whether that label sticks in her return to the short story remains to be seen. This collection, written over 20 years, again features plenty of animal life in stories ranging in length from one page to 20. If you haven\u2019t read her, now\u2019s the time to start. Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon\nMichael Lewis, Allen Lane, $55. October 3 This is the astonishing story of Sam Bankman-Fried, the young man who set up his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, in 2019 and three years later was rolling in money.\nBut when the crypto world went pear-shaped, Bankman-Fried\u2019s business hit an irreversible tailspin, and now he\u2019s facing multiple charges and due in court on October 3. If anyone can be relied on to tell this story of a financial Icarus with verve and narrative flair, it\u2019s Michael Lewis, author of Liar\u2019s Poker, Moneyball, and The Big Short. No doubt the updated edition will have the verdict on SBF. The Woman in Me\nBritney Spears, Simon & Schuster, $49.99. October 25 The huge-selling American singer has negotiated the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in her 41 years, but at the heart of this book \u2013 said to have earned her a $US15 million ($23.3 million) advance \u2013 is the controversial \u201cconservatorship\u201d by which her father and others were given almost complete control of her life, but still failed to stop it going off the rails many times.\nSure to be a bestseller, the book is described as a candid account of her life \u2013 exactly what her fans want. Mr Einstein\u2019s Secretary\nMatthew Reilly, Macmillan, $44.99. October 17 Hannah Fischer lived her early life in Berlin, and her next door neighbour was Albert Einstein \u2013 he seems to be having a popular culture moment. She idolised him, and she loved physics. But events intervene and the studious Hannah is forced out of Germany to a new, secretarial life in the US. But this is a Matthew Reilly novel \u2013 he\u2019s a film director now as well \u2013 and Hannah becomes some sort of spy and action hero, getting involved with all the major events and players of the years between the end of World War I and II \u2013 prohibition, gangsters, Nazis, and more. It\u2019s a lot of crash-bang-wallop fun and Reilly fans will love it.\nThe Seven\nChris Hammer, Allen & Unwin, $32.99. October 3 It\u2019s hard to believe that Scrublands, Chris Hammer\u2019s first crime novel, was published only five years ago. Since then, the former journo has followed the crime writer\u2019s timetable of a book a year. His latest brings back Nell Buchanan and Ivan Lucie, whom we met in Treasure & Dirt and Tilt, for a case of murder involving one of the seven families who rule the Yuwonderie district like a fiefdom. You can expect dark secrets to emerge and herrings to be red.\nLife as We Knew it\nAisha Dow & Melissa Cunningham, Scribe, $35. October 3 This account of how the pandemic affected Australia is a timely publication coming only a few days after Daniel Andrews, the man who approved probably the world\u2019s longest cumulative lockdown, left office. While many people may not want to revisit those stressful years, Aisha Dow and Melissa Cunningham, journalists with Nine newspapers, manage to make this a riveting story of discovery, dismay, and recovery. Ahead of the government\u2019s impending inquiry, you might find some answers here.\n\nThis article, authored by Jason Steger, was published by The Sydney Morning Herald on 2023-10-01 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":582}
{"title":"Patriots vs. Steelers FanDuel Picks: NFL DFS lineup advice for Week 14 TNF single-game tournaments","context":"## Patriots vs. Steelers FanDuel Picks: NFL DFS lineup advice for Week 14 TNF single-game tournaments\n\nAfter what was arguably the best Thursday night game of the season, we present to you what might be the worst, as the Patriots head to Pittsburgh to battle the Steelers. Whatever sport these teams will be attempting to play will probably end up setting the sport back 100 years, so much so that even the biggest supporters of defensive battles will be begging for some offense. The NFL probably didn't envision Mitch Trubisky facing off against Bailey Zappe when the schedule was released back in the spring, but sometimes the worst games on paper also bring the biggest profit opportunities. We're once again building a FanDuel DFS lineup so we have something to root for all night long.\nBefore we break down our picks and strategy, here are the most notable scoring rules for FanDuel contests: four-point passing TDs and half-point PPR.\nMORE THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL:\nDK lineup | ATS pick | Top props | Start-sit | Najee update\nPatriots-Steelers FanDuel Picks Week 14: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments\n$60,000 budget, at least one player from each team required\nMVP (1.5x points) RB Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots ($12,000). It doesn't matter whether Bailey Zappe, Mac Jones, Bill Belichick, or Robert Kraft end up taking snaps on Thursday night -- the Patriots' offense will continue to be tough on the eyes. Points will be at a premium between these teams, and controlling the clock is definitely important. That's where Elliott comes in. He's set to start this game with Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) sidelined for the foreseeable future, meaning New England's offense will be hoping for a vintage performance from the former Cowboy. Expect the RB to be fed a ton. Whether that results in a touchdown remains to be seen, but if anyone is scoring a TD on the Pats roster Thursday night, it's Elliott.\nFLEX RB Najee Harris, Steelers ($14,000). Much like the Patriots, this Steelers offense will want to establish the ground game, and that starts with Harris. It wasn't long ago that the RB was the subject of major criticism for looking slow and ineffective, but that narrative has flipped in a big way. With an average of 15 carries per game in the past five, we can expect at least that and maybe more from a Pittsburgh team that is starting Mitch Trubisky on Thursday night. As an added bonus, Harris is also the preferred goal-line back, scoring in three of those games. The Patriots' defense doesn't give up much, making Harris our best bet for success in an old-fashioned defensive struggle between two of the worst offenses the NFL has to offer.\nFLEX D\/ST Steelers ($10,000). The Steelers can get after the quarterback and force plenty of turnovers in any given game. They're facing an offense that's posted 13 points in the past three weeks -- not exactly encouraging for fantasy purposes. We think there's a good chance of a defensive score here, boosting the outlook for Pittsburgh's D\/ST. There will be few yards and even fewer points. Even though the Steelers can be vulnerable against the pass, the Patriots are not a team capable of exploiting that weakness. Don't overthink it.\nFLEX D\/ST Patriots ($9,000). Much like the Steelers, most of that logic also applies here with the Patriots. Trubisky will have to try to move the ball on a team that hasn't allowed more than 10 points in three straight weeks. We can't envision the Steelers scoring 20 points on offense, leaving us with a low-scoring affair. New England's problem is obviously the offense, so don't overlook the defense that continues to give them chances to win every week.\nFLEX K Chris Boswell, Steelers ($8,500). Could we be in for another field goal fest? Last week's contest in New England saw the Chargers kick two FGs en route to a 6-0 victory, so why rule it out here? Pittsburgh is already starting a backup QB and has a tough time scoring against everyone anyway, so it's safe to assume that FGs, not TDs, are on the menu once again.\nBest SuperDraft NFL DFS Picks for Patriots-Steelers\nThis year, we're also listing our favorite weekly DFS plays on SuperDraft.\nFor those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.\nMORE: Win BIG with SuperDraft! Get a free $10 deposit when you use promo code \"TSN\"!\nHere are the most notable scoring rules for SuperDraft NFL contests: Half-point PPR, four-point passing TDs, two-point bonuses for 100 rushing yards, 100 receiving yards, and 300 passing yards.\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS: How to play SuperDraft\nChampion (+50% points): RB Najee Harris, Steelers (Multiplier 1.9x)\nCo-Champ (+25% points): RB Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots (Multiplier 1.4x)\nSuper FLEX: QB Mitch Trubisky, Steelers (Multiplier 1.15x)\nSuper FLEX: TE Pat Freiermuth, Steelers (Multiplier 1.35x)\nSuper FLEX: K Chris Boswell, Steelers (Multiplier 1.8x)\nSuper FLEX: K Chad Ryland, Patriots (Multiplier 1.8x)\nThis week's SuperDraft lineup features our first \"Co-Champ,\" which gives us 25 percent more points for our player of choice.

{"title":"Who Are Mikaela Shiffrin\u2019s Parents? All You Need to Know About Skiing Legend\u2019s Family","context":"## Who Are Mikaela Shiffrin\u2019s Parents? All You Need to Know About Skiing Legend\u2019s Family\n\nWith grit and precision like no other, she gracefully descends the towering snow-capped mountain. Her hair billowing in the wind, her skis effortlessly gliding on the glistening ice as if afloat, she is one with the snow and the mountain. This is the essence of Mikaela Shiffrin. In the world of Alpine skiing, Shiffrin has long been a dominant force to be reckoned with.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nAfter all, the legend has made history by achieving the most World Cup wins by any male or female skier ever. With two Olympic golds, an impressive five overall World Cup victories, and four world championship wins, she is the youngest slalom champion in Olympic Alpine skiing history. Her legacy stands tall in the world of sports, but her roots run deep as well. Here\u2019s all you need to know about the skiing legends\u2019 family.\nHow Mikaela Shiffrin\u2019s parents fell in love through skiing\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nMikaela Shiffrin is the second child of Eileen and Jeff Shiffrin. Eileen had skiing in her blood and grew up with a passion for the sport. When she was a child, her parents would take her and her siblings up Mt. Greylock during the winter, and there, using sickles to cut the meadow grass, they would prepare a slope for their children to ski on. That is where her deep love for the sport took root. However, she had to pause her passion when she started studying at a nursing college. Later, her mother became a nurse, and this noble journey led her to the love of her life. In 1985, fate brought her mother and her father, Jeff, an anesthesiologist who at the time was completing his cardiothoracic rotation, together at St. Elizabeth\u2019s Medical Center in Brighton, Massachusetts. Jeff himself was an avid skier when he was young and would often visit Vermont on the weekend with his family as a child.\nvia Getty PARK CITY, UT \u2013 SEPTEMBER 25: Alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin poses for a portrait during the Team USA Media Summit ahead of the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games on September 25, 2017 in Park City, Utah. (Photo by Ezra Shaw\/Getty Images)\nEileen spoke about her love, saying he was \u201cbrilliant, jovial, and curious, with a solution to every problem\u201d. Unable to resist her charm, Jeff had asked Eileen out on a date, and he even had to convince her to give their love another chance. That\u2019s when the epic love story began. Young Jeff and Eileen took their first vacation together as a couple and visited the snowy wonderland of Aspen. The snowy trails and scenic winter reignited the passionate old flame in Eileen\u2019s heart for gliding down the soft powdery snow, and she even stated, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Jeff, I wouldn\u2019t have kept skiing\u201d. She even stated how Jeff reawakened the love of the sport that had remained in Eileen\u2019s heart over the years.\nGrowing up with skier parents\nIn 1986, a year after they first met, the beautiful couple tied the knot. Five years later, realizing the incredible connection they felt to the snowy trails of Aspen, they moved to the world-class skiing city of Vail. A year after moving to Vail, Jeff and Eileen welcomed Taylor, Mikaela\u2019s brother, in 1992. And three years later, Mikaela arrived in 1995. Jeff and Eileen, both avid and passionate skiers from a tender age, introduced their children to their passion and the world of skiing. The couple would take little Mikaela and Taylor on family outings at Vail and teach the two the art of gliding over the snow. Later, when Taylor was 9 and Mikaela was 7, their parents enrolled them in Ski Club Vail.\nAccording to Aspen Sojourner, SCV\u2019s Rika Moore began to coach the kids, and soon the two rapidly began to progress. When most coaches would not even let other kids try the slalom gates, Mikaela, on the other hand, cleared the slalom gates with her sheer talent. Later, the family moved to New England due to Jeff\u2019s career, and the kids found their safe space at the Burke Mountain Academy.\nThe family moved to Vail in 2009, but Mikaela went back to Burke, and her mother decided to move with her and help her by home-schooling her while monitoring her training. Over the years, the fire and sheer talent within Mikaela couldn\u2019t be tamed. She even won the prestigious Topolino races in Italy, sweeping most of the wins when she was 14. Her parents tried their best to keep the soaring youngling grounded.\nHer dad\u2019s rules for her were, \u201cBe nice. Think first. Have fun,\u201d which Shiffrin has affixed to the back of her helmet. Taylor, too, made immense progress and went on to win two NCAA team titles with the University of Denver. Later in 2011, Eileen became Mikaela\u2019s full-time traveling companion and would also handle her schoolwork, while Jeff began to handle the logistics and would use his PTO to visit them with Taylor. The passion for the sport that had reignited in the relationship of Jeff and Eileen saw its fruition in their history-making daughter, Mikaela Shiffrin.\nA tragic time for the family\nOver the years, Jeff saw his daughter win one downhill, one super-G, and place fourth in a second downhill. She was at the pinnacle of her career, with her sights set on the fourth consecutive overall title. After spending some much-needed family time together in the resort town of Lake Garda, Italy, after the Bansko races, the family said goodbye to each other and made a promise to see each other in five weeks. However Two days later, while Mikaela was training in Italy, she received a concerned call from her brother Taylor asking to speak urgently with their mom. Taylor told the two how Jeff had fallen and that they needed to return home immediately.\nJeff had sustained a head injury due to an accidental fall. The family spent Jeff\u2019s last days together by his side as a family before he passed away on February 2, 2020. This shattered the family and left a huge void in their hearts. The pain of the loss was gut-wrenching for Eileen, who said, \u201cWe learned quickly that people have their crosses to bear, and they aren\u2019t everyone else\u2019s crosses; they\u2019re the ones we have to bear ourselves. You learn to suffer in silence\u201d.\nHow Mikaela Shiffrin recovered from the devastation\nFor Mikaela Shiffrin, this devastating loss broke her heart. She even said she was left questioning how she could ever ski again. Mikaela stated that skiing was \u201cthe place where I feel most connected to him. It\u2019s kind of hard to feel that anywhere else\u201d. She even shared that she was in the middle of a sports-illustrated photoshoot when her dad had the accident.\nThis left her feeling immense pain every time she would see her pictures from the shoot. Without her anchor, the grief would be so immense that she couldn\u2019t even get out of bed, said her mother. Eileen even stated, \u201cShe was so devastated. She couldn\u2019t stop crying\u201d.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nHowever, Taylor, unable to see his sister reeling from the pain one day, suddenly walked over to his mom and Mikaela and told her \u201cYou can\u2019t quit on us\u201d. He spoke in an interview, calling the moment his moment of \u201cselfishness,\u201d and said, It\u2019s what his dad would also want and how he would\u2019ve handled the situation.\nOpinion: Are New Rules by Skiing Federation Enough to Protect the Environment Amid Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup\nHe said his dad would use the phrase he often used when they were children, which was \u201cWhen you\u2019re going through hell, keep going. Don\u2019t stop\u201d. After a lengthy period of absence from the sport, she returned in 2021 for the first of the two slalom races at Levi.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn 2022, when she set the record for the most World Cup wins in Alpine skiing history, she honored her dad by writing on Instagram, \u201cThank you. Dad, I hope you had a good view. Mom, your strength, love, support, and belief in me is the greatest treasure I\u2019ll ever know\u201d.\nWatch this story: 7x Skiing World Champion Mikaela Shiffrin\u2019s Intense Workout Routine Challenges Michael B.

{"title":"Dropout\u2019s dropping CollegeHumor on its 5th anniversary \u2014 here\u2019s why and what the future holds","context":"## Dropout\u2019s dropping CollegeHumor on its 5th anniversary \u2014 here\u2019s why and what the future holds\n\nWhatever happened to CollegeHumor? Fans of the Dropout streaming service will tell you at the drop of a hat: The creatives behind it announced a new subscription service in late 2018, made a few ambitious seasons of comedy and live-play Dungeons & Dragons \u2014 and then got walloped when their corporate owner, IAC, stopped funding CH Media, resulting in layoffs of nearly the entire staff in January 2020 (which was a totally chill month to lose your job, with absolutely no major upheavals in television production on the horizon).\nBut CollegeHumor didn\u2019t drop off: IAC sold the brand to executive producer Sam Reich, allowing shows like Dimension 20, Um, Actually, and Game Changer to keep doing the work, and spinning off their most successful formats on Dropout. On Dropout\u2019s fifth anniversary this week, CollegeHumor is \u201cthe most healthy and sustainable [it\u2019s] ever been as a company,\u201d says Dimension 20 host Brennan Lee Mulligan. And for Dropout\u2019s anniversary, Reich announced in a new video, the company will cease to be CollegeHumor at all.\nPolygon sat down with Reich and Mulligan for the occasion of Dropout\u2019s fifth anniversary to chat about upcoming shows, how a YouTube video brand successfully pivoted to the subscription streaming model, and the big birthday announcement itself: CollegeHumor is no more.\nPolygon: Before we dig into the big news, I want to start with another recent announcement you\u2019ve made: The next season of Dimension 20. Brennan, I know this is Aabria Iyengar\u2019s game, but you\u2019re playing in it, and she\u2019s not here and you are. So: Why stoats?\nBrennan Lee Mulligan: Why stoats?! They\u2019re a marvelous animal. Burrow\u2019s End is a really fun season of Dimension 20. And I say fun because Aabria\u2019s taking us to this wonderful Secret of NIMH, Watership Down \u2014 there\u2019s a certain subgenre. And we find in Dimension 20 that we have our most success when we get specific. It\u2019s not just fantasy, it\u2019s Game of Thrones meets Candyland. It\u2019s not just a mystery, it\u2019s noir, or it\u2019s Agatha Christie \u2014 which is actually two of the Side Quest seasons we\u2019ve done, one of which Sam was a player in. It\u2019s about getting specific with the comparisons that you\u2019re reaching out to and where you\u2019re drawing inspiration from.\n\u201cCute little critters\u201d is a quite broad, fantastical storytelling genre \u2014 within that there\u2019s a subgenre of perhaps the darkest and most grim stories ever told. You know, I guess there\u2019s adult literature that\u2019s as haunting as Watership Down, but something about the juxtaposition of the cute little bunnies, and a story about death, displacement, horror... Lovecraft wishes that he could have the eldritch horror of rabbits trying to describe a road and the cars that drive on it.\nSam Reich: We want to take our audience and expose them to deep trauma. [laughs] And the way that you do that is by luring them into a sense of comfort and security.\nMulligan: The mental mathematics of the season are also a fun thing. The fact that we go like, Hey, it\u2019s tough being a little furry critter, the woods are dangerous. You know, we see nature documentaries where little stoats and bunnies are getting absolutely eviscerated by falcons and stuff, and you watch it and you\u2019re like, Tough break, buddy, and you move on with your day. But we\u2019ve given them names and voices. And now we\u2019ll see! Now we\u2019ll see how glib they are!\nReich: David Attenborough couldn\u2019t do this!\nSam, that reminds me of something you said to NPR earlier this year, about how you found success with Dropout in, instead of going broad for the viral video, going for \u201csomething that feels special to a small group of people.\u201d Has five years of Dropout inspired any advice for creators, or producers, or fans \u2014 basically anyone who\u2019s looking to get away from algorithmically powered viral demand, to other platform structures?\nReich: My advice is find a better business model. I think we live in an era of online content right now that is being defined and shaped by algorithms. And that\u2019s true no matter the platform. I think different platforms are shaping content in different ways, and that\u2019s kind of exciting as a creator. Like, Which of these sports am I most excited to play? Lately, TikTok has been prioritizing videos that are longer than a minute, because they\u2019re trying to encourage watch time, while YouTube Shorts still doesn\u2019t allow you to put up anything that\u2019s longer than a minute. So, platforms compete with each other and themselves, and they yield these kind of Frankenstein products. And even in the midst of all of that I am regularly inspired by a lot of the stuff I see on there. I love hanging out on these platforms. I think some of these creators are getting really, really creative.\nBut I think what the experience of doing Dropout has taught us \u2014 and what I would tell others \u2014 is for you to make this sustainable you need to have something to offer that\u2019s off of those platforms. There\u2019s lots of ways to do that. One of them is to create a subscription offering like on Patreon and try to drive people to it. Another is to try to leverage your online presence into opportunities in traditional Hollywood. Some folks who aren\u2019t content creators first and foremost are using it as a creative way to market their music or market their physical products, and that\u2019s working out well for those folks.\nI think for us, the heart and the soul of what we do is on on Dropout. We are very lucky, very lucky, that social media has turned out to be such a good way for us to market this platform. And we are also gleefully no longer beholden to it.\nThe story of Dropout\u2019s history recounted in your anniversary video is that you kicked off, and you were raring to go, and then immediately got kneecapped by a corporate sale and a global pandemic, and then you succeeded anyway. If there hadn\u2019t been those hurdles, there would have been other hurdles. I\u2019m sure you ran into other things that surprised you about transforming from CollegeHumor to Dropout. What were the hurdles we don\u2019t hear about because getting dumped by your parent company and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic overshadow them?\nMulligan: Susana, every day I awaken and am hurled Wallace and Gromit-style out of my bed into another day of making content and telling stories and doing the stuff we get to do at Dropout. Being asked what our strategy was \u2014 I think Sam is much better, writ large, at top-down, bird\u2019s-eye strategic oversight than I am.\nReich: Zooming out is what you\u2019re saying, I\u2019m good at zooming out?\nMulligan: You\u2019re great at zooming out. Asking me what our strategy was is sort of like \u2014 Susana, you\u2019ve pulled up alongside a man sprinting from a bear, and are like, What was the thought process behind going left at that tree back there? And I\u2019m like [unintelligible gasps]. That\u2019s the headspace that I operate from. But to address the hurdles that you were talking about in terms of what lessons can be drawn, or what do we think would have happened had those obstacles not been there? If those obstacles had not been there, well, my god, I would love for those obstacles not to have been there, I would definitely press that button. Mostly to have prevented COVID, which would be a great boon to the world and global civilization\u2014\nReich: See, I feel like you nailed it, Brennan. The big one I was going to point to is that this is relentless. Not in a bad way \u2014 like, we spent our lives as entertainers starving, and then at some point, we arrive at the all-you-can-eat buffet \u2014 that\u2019s like when we\u2019ve really made it \u2014 and we go, My god, I\u2019m gonna have to eat so much, forever. [laughs] Adam Conover, who is one of my dear, dear friends and also remains pretty mixed about digital versus traditional entertainment, he\u2019s not sure where he wants to fall in terms of those those relative opportunities. He\u2019s like, The thing about digital is you create for yourself a jail, and then you have to live in that jail forever, because your audience wants that from you, again and again and again. Whereas in traditional media, you have a certain amount of seasons, and maybe you get canceled, then you move on to something else.\nI think Brennan and I both are in jail right now. The way in which we\u2019re lucky is we both jailed ourselves inside anthology series.\nMulligan: Yeah.\nReich: So, thank god for that bit of (it turns out) foresight, happy accident \u2014 which is we get to strut our stuff in lots of different ways despite the fact that we\u2019re beholden to these shows, which, so long as Dropout continues to be successful, will never be canceled? Because...?\nMulligan: Yeah, \u201cno gods no masters\u201d is a pretty exciting place to have found that [success]. And to Sam\u2019s point too, yeah, every time that I go, Woof, we make a lot of this show, I turn around and see the ghost of my absolutely starving 25-year-old self being like, [sarcastically] Oh, you got big problems, huh? Ohhh, big guy got big problems! Wow! [villainously] I\u2019ll kill you. And then I go, Ah, yes, back to it.\nReich: Yeah, I watch myself performing at the New York Renaissance faire. And let me just say, those are a bunch of incredibly fierce and talented performers.\nI was there last summer. It\u2019s a good time!\nReich: Incredibly talented, comedic improvisers, so good at thinking on their feet. Those long days, on your feet all day\u2014\nMulligan: Just hoping to get a callback \u2014 hoping to get a callback for the Orbit gum activation in Times Square, where me and 20 other improvisers will be paid $100 to receive 10 hours of abuse from real strangers on the street.\nReich: Dude, I did a month of background work on Third Watch, which was like the worst Law & Order.\nMulligan: I was a camera PA on Criminal Intent, which was the actual worst Law & Order! And it wasn\u2019t even during the Vincent D\u2019Onofrio episodes.\nReich: Oh my god. Didn\u2019t even have the pleasure of watching Vincent work.\nGoing back to your big anniversary announcement, I think a lot of folks will think, Oh, wow! Dropout\u2019s got a big anniversary announcement, is it going to be a new series? New content? Guest stars? and I can see a name change puzzling people. You give a great explanation in the announcement video, but in pure layman\u2019s terms, is this a big deal? I feel like a lot of your fans already know you guys as Dropout.\nReich: Yeah, we told ourselves we would do this when it felt most natural to do it. So in a way, it\u2019s not a big deal at all. And I think a piece of that, to your point, Susana, is intentional. More people who are active fans think of us as Dropout than CollegeHumor now, and this message is almost for everyone else. We do, in the back half of the video, race through a ton of new show announcements.\nDon\u2019t think I was going to ignore that, Sam!\nMulligan: I would say too, to Sam\u2019s point, I think internally, we\u2019re just \u201cus.\u201d We\u2019re a comedy company and we have enough glibness and irreverence to have a healthy sense of humor about something like a brand change, internally as a company. We\u2019re like, Yes, this is something that of course we\u2019re having fun with, and I think you can see the, like, tongue-in-cheek-ness in the video itself, which is super fun, but also very earnest celebration of all the amazing work that everybody that works on the platform has done.\nI would say, Susana, the obviousness of it is a testament to how tapped in you are. People that are very close to us feel in on the joke, people that are very close to us are like, Of course, I\u2019ve known that CollegeHumor was doing Dropout \u2014 I was there in 2018 when the thing launched. But I guarantee you every 18 months, some video creator will be like [in a salacious YouTube thumbnail voice] \u201cWhat happened to CollegeHumor?\u201d and the first 100 comments will be \u201cThey\u2019re the most healthy and sustainable they\u2019ve ever been as a company. What are you talking about?\u201d But that video will still go viral.\nSo there\u2019s a huge track of the mainstream that I think this actually is worth having an internal, well-made, funny statement about. Because it\u2019s definitely saturated our fan base, but my god, every time you go out \u2014 there\u2019s even a joke in the video about how your dad will still call us CollegeHumor. That\u2019s kind of an element of what\u2019s being spoken to.\nReich: The truth is \u2014 and we don\u2019t go into this at length in the video \u2014 we wanted to make the video even before we recognized that we were going to do the name change. We thought five years would be a good opportunity for us to do a little callback to our original announcement video, a kind of update. But we\u2019ve been wanting to do away with the name CollegeHumor almost since Dropout was first formed.\nThe name was \u201cDropout\u201d \u2014 as opposed to \u201cCollegeHumor Plus,\u201d or \u201cPro\u201d or whatever else it could have been \u2014 specifically because we were itching to distance ourselves from that brand name. It\u2019s been a blessing and a curse for a long time, the blessing being one of the few brands with quote-unquote \u201cstaying power\u201d on the internet, so it has recognizability with a few different generations. And the curse being... pretty self-explanatory. We could not be more distant from our frat-y roots at this point.\nYou got Whose Line Is It Anyway?\u2019s Wayne Brady on Make Some Noise this season, and in a Tumblr post you said he told you, \u201cThere are only two people doing taped improv correctly: us and you.\u201d If I said that Dropout is a notable part of the history of improv performance, both in shows like Make Some Noise and Game Changer \u2014 and Dimension 20, that is improvised performance \u2014 does that activate your impostor syndrome, or is that something that\u2019s been on your dream board for five years?\nReich: Every waking moment of my day activates my impostor syndrome. But at the same time, I love that sentiment. And I think some of that\u2019s been a happy accident. We set out with a lot of scripted content on Dropout, and it didn\u2019t really work. It\u2019s once we broke away from IAC that we started to do more unscripted stuff, simply because it was what was working on the platform. And I think it\u2019s allowed us really to explore the world of improv more than we ever thought we would get to. And Brennan I knew as a world-class improviser and comedic performer even before I knew he was a GM.\nBrennan just shot something for us as a part of a new show, that\u2019s an improv-based show, that\u2019s one of my favorite things I\u2019ve ever seen him do.\nMulligan: Aw, thanks, man. That\u2019s very kind.\nReich: And Brennan\u2019s been through [Upright Citizens Brigade], and I\u2019ve been through UCB, and so many of us have had this training. But Hollywood told us for years and years that there was no great way to capture this on film. And here we are. It\u2019s kind of serendipitous and magical.\nMulligan: Yeah. It\u2019s very special. The impostor syndrome is very real, but I find myself bouncing back and forth between the feeling of \u2014 When Wayne Brady says something like that, you sort of can\u2019t accept something that nice. So you deflect it away. But also, I feel like there\u2019s something that would be too glib and dismissive to not be cognizant about the incredible fortune that we\u2019ve had.\nIf you have a sober eye and look around at the entertainment landscape at other places that are able to celebrate improv and celebrate spontaneous comedy, whether on Game Changer or Make Some Noise and things that push the envelope and play with the form \u2014 or even, one of my favorite things to do with Dimension 20 is taking improv comedians, who their entire creative life has been around following game, comedic beats, very in that UCB sketch structure, and let them open their narrative wings and really dip into storytelling in a way they often don\u2019t get an opportunity to do on stage. So on the one hand, yes, very much impostor syndrome, and Oh, something that nice can\u2019t be true. And then on the other hand, I do recognize the rare air we are breathing with having a space like this, so that\u2019s really wonderful.\nI wasn\u2019t completely certain that you\u2019d slipped some stealth reveals into the announcement video, but I figured it was pretty likely. Which of them are you most looking forward to? Or, do you have a favorite Easter egg snuck into the video?\nReich: OK, the one that Brennan did the episode of recently that I was wild about is a show we\u2019re calling Very Important People. And it\u2019s a reboot of something we did 12 or 13 years ago on CollegeHumor.\nMulligan: One of my favorite CollegeHumor things of all time when I was a fan at home watching CollegeHumor.\nReich: [And it was] called Hello My Name Is. And the format was that we would put, specifically Josh Ruben, in really ambitious makeup, and we would sit him down for a Charlie Rose-style interview in that character, which he would have only a minute to create. We rebooted that as Very Important People. Vic Michaelis is hosting, and the cast is this rotating cast of characters from our improv world and it\u2019s so... Every once in a while I get what I call the \u201cquality chills\u201d? I got quality chills while I was watching the Dungeons and Drag Queens shoot; this creepy-crawly sensation on your back like, This is really good. Because this is really good. A lot of quality chills.\nMulligan: Hell yeah.\nBrennan, do you have a favorite Easter egg from the video?\nReich: There are three seasons of Dimension 20 in that lineup of quick titles...\nMulligan: Do I have a favorite Easter egg? All I\u2019m gonna say is this: The bag of chips I eat in the video was a real bag of chips, and I really ate the whole bag by myself. So when you see me finish the bag on camera, I housed that whole bag of chips. And I don\u2019t want anyone to say that\u2019s movie magic. I don\u2019t want anyone to say that that was fake. That was an entire bag of Cool Ranch Doritos hidden in a Chompsky\u2019s bag that the art department made, and I put that whole thing to bed. I don\u2019t ask for much, but I\u2019m gonna good and goddamn get my credit: I ate the whole bag of chips, OK?\nReich: This is not an endorsement. The Chompsky\u2019s company does not confirm or deny that Chompsky\u2019s chips are in fact Cool Ranch Doritos.\n\nThis article, authored by Susana Polo, was published by Polygon on 2023-09-26 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":586}
{"title":"Jack Skellington turned legendary composer Danny Elfman into a weirdo rock star","context":"## Jack Skellington turned legendary composer Danny Elfman into a weirdo rock star\n\nThe last person in the world who thought Danny Elfman would play Coachella was Danny Elfman.\nBut in 2022, the legendary composer behind projects like Batman, Spider-Man, The Simpsons, and countless Tim Burton films took the desert stage, shirtless and ready to rip. Those who witnessed the spectacle of Elfman\u2019s performance were blown away \u2014 \u201cNobody else even came close to bringing that level of chaotic pageantry,\u201d wrote Vulture at the time \u2014 while images of the roaring composer were quick to go viral on social media.\nMost movie buffs knew Elfman as Burton\u2019s bespectacled, goth-adjacent music pal.\nThen, in 2022, most movie buffs did a double take. Wow, yes, that\u2019s frickin\u2019 Danny Elfman.\nElfman\u2019s rock turn may not have surprised those who were clicked into the alternative scene of the late 1970s and \u201980s; before he established his macabre staccato identity in Burton\u2019s Pee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands, Elfman was a member of new wave band Oingo Boingo, which hit its hardest with the 1985 single \u201cWeird Science\u201d (featured in the film of the same name). Founded by Danny\u2019s brother Richard, the band steadily toured and cut records through the early \u201990s. (In fact, members of the band still tour to this day.) When Elfman left the band to pivot to composing, he also left behind his live music career \u2014 for so long that many of his younger superhero-movie-watching\/Hot Topic-shopping devotees never knew his lineage. And even in the Oingo Boingo days, the musician wasn\u2019t going as hard as he did at Coachella.\nSo what brought him back? What rebirthed him as a man who could share a stage with Billie Eilish and Limp Bizkit\u2019s Wes Borland? To my mind, it\u2019s Henry Selick\u2019s The Nightmare Before Christmas. Produced by Burton, the stop-motion project was a black sheep for Walt Disney Animation that blossomed into a cult favorite, and based on the last few years in Elfman\u2019s life, a transformative milestone for a musician born to shred on a stage like no other rocker ever has.\nElfman joined Burton early on in the development of The Nightmare Before Christmas, plussing up the loose animation pitch into a musical worthy of the Disney Renaissance. And after recording demos for Jack Skellington\u2019s big numbers, Elfman became the obvious pick to record the final versions (while The Princess Bride\u2019s Chris Sarandon was hired to match Elfman\u2019s baritone vocals in the spoken dialogue). The rest is history: Elfman went on to win awards for his Nightmare work, and the soundtrack became a cross-holiday staple every October through December.\nElfman did not peak with Nightmare in 1993. His four Oscar nominations for Good Will Hunting, Men in Black, Big Fish, and Milk were all awarded in the years that followed, and his work has extended far beyond film over the decades. In 2005, he premiered the highly baroque Serenada Schizophrana, his first work composed specifically for concert orchestra. In 2008, he wrote the music for the American Ballet Theatre\u2019s Rabbit and Rogue ballet and in 2011 composed for Cirque Du Soleil\u2019s $100 million Iris show. But it\u2019s bops like \u201cThis Is Halloween\u201d and \u201cJack\u2019s Obsession\u201d that will be engraved on his future tombstone, and he\u2019s never been ashamed to play the hits \u2014 unlike Disney, which had no clue how to release the movie to an audience weaned on The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, but has since incorporated its parts into everything from theme parks to 3D re-releases to the Disney Dreamlight Valley sim. And unlike his film score work, The Nightmare Before Christmas gives him the chance to take the stage.\nIn 2013, the former Oingo Boingo frontman returned to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall to perform his scores from Tim Burton movies with a full orchestral backup. This included select numbers from The Nightmare Before Christmas, which he sang in full. The concert appearance was such a hit, Disney invited Elfman to appear alongside his co-stars Catherine O\u2019Hara (Sally) and Ken Page (Oogie Boogie) at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles for a night purely dedicated to The Nightmare Before Christmas. The concert was such a hit, the group has performed it on the regular every October \u2014 and will do so again this Halloween.\nThe hype around his various Burton and Nightmare Before Christmas concerts sparked the idea for Coachella programmers that Elfman could play alongside pop acts of the moment. As Elfman tells it, there was immediate and obvious hesitation on his part: He was not a rock star or a pop star or hip-hop star. But after watching Childish Gambino and Janelle Mon\u00e1e unleash pure theatrical mayhem at Coachella 2019, he saw his way in. The then-66-year-old began immediate work on a set that would blend his film music, Oingo Boingo hits, and experimental songs fit for a rowdy crowd.\nAs he put in a video for the music festival, \u201cComing out and doing something as myself, not as Jack [Skellington], was terrifying and exciting.\u201d\nCoachella 2020 was ultimately canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Elfman was purely activated and kept on creating. He released his new music as a studio album, Big Mess, and eventually took the Coachella stage in his now-notorious 2022 performance. As envisioned, the Elfman revue bounced from known tunes to weirdo grooves, all backed by animated graphics that paired well with, uh, extracurricular substances. But it was not a total upending of expectations; there was still room for Mr. Skellington at Coachella.\nIn a flurry of post-show interviews, Elfman comes off as rejuvenated. While the show hasn\u2019t realigned the trajectory of his career \u2014 he went on to score White Noise for director Noah Baumbach and continues to tour with his symphonic works \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine him shaking the moment in the spotlight. (This is where I want to flag that earlier this year, a Rolling Stone report uncovered a 2018 sexual misconduct lawsuit filed against the composer, which he settled out of court. Elfman has vehemently denied the accusations against him as \u201cvicious and wholly false.\u201d No additional accusations or investigations have come out in the wake of the story, and Disney and his longtime collaborators continue to work with him.)\nDuring the Coachella set, Elfman proclaimed that it was \u201cmy first time onstage as \u2018myself\u2019 in 27 years.\u201d He\u2019s likely referring to his time acting as Jack Skellington, though looking back, it doesn\u2019t seem like Elfman as the frontman of Oingo Boingo was his true \u201cself\u201d either. The act launched at Coachella is not a return to form. It is the final form.\nThere are few musical wanderers like Elfman, capable of swinging between genres and mediums and venues, and his time performing as Jack Skellington has everything to do with that elasticity. He is now unified \u2014 as a six-packed weirdo rock star with floppy red hair and body tattoos head-banging to the theme from The Simpsons.\nElfman has said at the time that there were no plans to tour his laser-lit Coachella act, although he busted it out earlier this year at the North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre in California. It seems entirely possible that Elfman\u2019s rock star persona will explode out of nowhere with the rhythm of his percussive scores. That seems like the best-case scenario for a musician who never wants to be defined, and is often trapped in the conventions of his business. A regular Jack Skellington.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story stated that Elfman performed at Royal Albert Hall in 2014. He performed his Music of Tim Burton concert in 2013. We\u2019ve edited the article to reflect this.\n\nThis article, authored by Matt Patches, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-13 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":587}
{"title":"USA vs Germany player ratings: USMNT defensive errors blight positive performance by Pulisic, Weah","context":"## USA vs Germany player ratings: USMNT defensive errors blight positive performance by Pulisic, Weah\n\nRENTSCHLER FIELD, HARTFORD \u2014 The United States appeared well positioned to fight with a European power through 45 minutes, but the house of cards came crashing down after the break as the U.S. men's national team succumbed to a 3-1 defeat to Germany in Hartford.\nPresented with a chance to test themselves against a world-class opponent on home soil, the U.S. entered the break level as a Christian Pulisic stunner was cancelled out by Ilkay Gundogan's poaching.\nYet after halftime, as Gio Reyna was withdrawn from his first start back under Gregg Berhalter to build his fitness, the U.S. midfield was overrun and the defense committed a multitude of errors to allow the Germans to gain full control of proceedings.\n\"It\u2019s frustrating because its just little moments,\" said U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner after the match. \"Little moments made a big difference at the World Cup, and it\u2019s kinda the same story here.\u201d\nThe Sporting News reviews how each USMNT player performed across the 90 minutes.\nMORE: Recap the 3-1 defeat for the USMNT against Germany in Hartford\nUSA player ratings vs Germany\nUSA starting lineup (4-3-3, right to left): 1. Turner (GK) \u2014 19. Scally, 4. Richards (Carter-Vickers, 66'), 13. Ream, 2. Dest \u2014 7. Reyna (de la Torre, 46'), 6. Musah, 8. McKennie (Cardoso, 75') \u2014 21. Weah (Aaronson, 66'), 20. Balogun (Pepi, 66'), 10. Pulisic (Paredes, 75').\nGK: Matt Turner \u2014 8\nThe only goal Matt Turner conceded in the first half came on a play Turner initially saved, before being slammed home by Ilkay Gundogan as the rest of the U.S. defense just stood there and watched.\nTurner made a host of excellent saves, and while Germany certainly didn't dazzle in the finishing department, he was a critical part of the U.S. performance as the defense melted in front of him. The second half was overwhelming for the U.S. back line, and Turner had little answer for the waves of pressure, but he still made a number of good stops, particularly just after the break with the game still level.\nA quality performance from the U.S. goalkeeper, although he could have done better to help marshal a totally scattered defensive line.\nMatt Turner says no \u274c\n\nWatch USA vs. Germany live on TNT or Max \ud83d\udcfa pic.twitter.com\/x2HslCk3s2 \u2014 B\/R Football (@brfootball) October 14, 2023\nRB: Joe Scally \u2014 6\nJoe Scally was tidy in possession, and while he offered very little in the attack, that was largely by design as they didn't need him on that right side with Tim Weah cooking.\nScally defended ok, and wasn't guilty of any big mistakes, which is more than most of the other U.S. defenders can say. It wasn't a standout performance by any means, and the whole back line has some soul searching to do, but others were far more culpable than the Borussia Monchengladbach man.\nCB: Chris Richards \u2014 4\nStatistically, Chris Richards had a pretty good match, missing with just one pass of his 42 attempted and not being beaten at any point by any German attackers. Yet his lack of volume speaks... well, volumes.\nRichards was off the pace for much of his 65 minutes, and failed to get involved as his teammates were beaten repeatedly on the dribble. It was Richards' positioning that let him down, and he should have been more involved with the U.S. under siege in such an open match.\nCB: Tim Ream \u2014 5\nChris Richards often left Tim Ream on an island, and the 36-year-old just could not cope with the waves of German attackers.\nThe third German goal was emblematic of this lack of chemistry between the two U.S. center-backs: Richards stepped up to guard a free Niklas Fullkrug who got by Sergino Dest, and Ream was unaware as that left Leroy Sane free on goal himself. These two just didn't have it, and Ream was powerless to pick up the slack.\nJamal Musiala dances through the USA defense and Germany lead 3-1 \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\n\nWatch USA vs. Germany live on TNT or Max \ud83d\udcfa pic.twitter.com\/PdjsjkObZR \u2014 B\/R Football (@brfootball) October 14, 2023\nLB: Sergino Dest \u2014 4\nIf it were possible to give Sergino Dest two different scores, one for the attacking half and one for the defensive half, we'd do it, but that's not how this works. Dest was lively up front as he combined with Christian Pulisic and worked very well on the ball. He got Mats Hummels booked on a counter-attack and delivered a few very quality crosses.\nDest was also guilty of some of the game's worst defensive errors. He was completely non-existent as Leroy Sane blazed by him on the first Germany goal, and he nearly got his team in trouble again right before halftime by holding onto the ball too long after making an interception rather than just clearing it out of danger. Filling in for Antonee Robinson at left-back rather than his natural right, Germany targeted him on multiple occasions, to great profit.\nHe had a few good moments guarding Leroy Sane in the second half, but he was a top culprit for Germany's second goal by playing Niklas Fullkrug onside. If the U.S. had profited more from his attacking presence the narrative around his performance might be different, but with the story of the match focused on the defensive errors, Dest is a guilty party.\nCM: Yunus Musah \u2014 6\nAnother player who did well in possession but struggled defensively, Yunus Musah dazzled at times on the ball but was beaten on the first Germany goal by whiffing with his slide.\nMusah's nutmeg of Florian Wirtz was a highlight moment of the match, and he was active on both ends of the pitch. Yet a few bad giveaways or defensive moments betrayed his usual stoutness in the middle of the pitch. Overall, the mistakes didn't take away from his performance quite as much as Dest's, but they were still concerning.\nCM: Weston McKennie \u2014 4\nOther than a pair of critical blocks right before halftime, Weston McKennie was a mess through the first 45 minutes. He was constantly unsure of where he should be as Germany built forward with incisive pace, and he was one of many U.S. players caught unaware on the first-half Ilkay Gundogan goal.\nMcKennie didn't put a first-half pass wrong, going 18\/18 before the break and 28\/30 overall, but his positioning was all wrong out of possession. McKennie was a sieve as the U.S. midfield was invisible defensively, leaving their defenders completely unshielded, particularly at the top of the penalty area.\nIt was only a matter of time before the floodgates opened, and that they did after halftime. McKennie was eventually withdrawn in what felt like one of Gregg Berhalter's only tactical substitutions of the match.\nCM: Gio Reyna \u2014 7\nIn his first 45 minutes of international football under Gregg Berhalter since the World Cup fallout, Gio Reyna was his usual self, drawing the attention of German defenders and proving visionary with his passing. He combined with Folarin Balogun on a number of occasions on the counter, which is a link-up that U.S. fans have been begging for more of.\nReyna was only fit for 45 minutes of play here as he returns from a leg injury, but it's no coincidence that Germany truly secured midfield dominance when he came off the field. A promising performance for the young playmaker who should head back to Borussia Dortmund after this international break with plenty of confidence moving forward.\nRW: Tim Weah \u2014 8\nThough Germany carved the U.S. defense to pieces, their attacking threat remained strong, and almost all the danger came from the wings. While Christian Pulisic starred on the left, Tim Weah was equally devastating down the right, dazzling with electric pace and good link-up.\nWeah's biggest moment came when he scorched Robin Gosens on the wing in the first half, knocking it past the German defender and then beating him with blistering speed to get back on the ball. Weah's statistical haul don't quite do him justice, but he was a threat throughout his 66 minutes of action.\nST: Folarin Balogun \u2014 7\nU.S. fans are salivating for Folarin Balogun to get more touches up front, and as Gregg Berhalter foreshadowed pre-match, they made a clear attempt to do that. Gio Reyna and Tim Weah did the most of the work in that regard,\nLW: Christian Pulisic \u2014 9\nThere's no doubting who remains the most electric and incisive U.S. player is, as Christian Pulisic once again backed up his nickname of 'Captain America'. The first half stunner was emblematic of his performance, but beyond that he constantly proved a threat to German's out-of-position right-back Jonathan Tah.\nPulisic completed 27 of 29 passes, a tidy haul for a player of his attacking intent, and created two chances in addition to getting the goal. His corners remain awful, and it's a wonder why he is still on duty for that role, but otherwise Pulisic was a menace.\nChristian Pulisic with an absolute banger \ud83d\ude80\n\nWatch USA vs. Germany live on TNT or Max \ud83d\udcfa pic.twitter.com\/G7t6KxLjFO \u2014 B\/R Football (@brfootball) October 14, 2023\nPlayer ratings for USMNT substitutes vs Germany\n45th min: Luca de la Torre \u2014 5\nBrought on to replace Gio Reyna at halftime, Luca de la Torre was unable to stem the German tide, despite being a more defensive-minded option than Reyna in what should have been a swap to shore up the midfield.\n65th min: Cameron Carter-Vickers \u2014 7\nWith Tim Ream and even Chris Richards struggling at various stages in this match, Cameron Carter-Vickers remains a top-tier center-back in this U.S. player pool and a clear starter when healthy. He came off the bench due to his recent hamstring troubles, but was stout in his 25 minutes of action.\nThe Celtic defender had 22 touches and gave away possession just two times, completing two dribbles and making two clearances. Carter-Vickers was not a target for Germany to attack nearly as much as the other three defenders on the pitch, a strong nod to his abilities.\n65th min: Brenden Aaronson \u2014 7\nProbably the the U.S. substitute to make the biggest impact, Brenden Aaronson was bright in the attack, dazzling with his dribbling skills and helping usher the U.S. forward amidst a second-half onslaught from Germany. A good showing from the Union Berlin winger who needs confidence at the moment.\n65th min: Ricardo Pepi \u2014 5\nIt wasn't an ideal situation for Ricardo Pepi to enter in, coming on with the U.S. shell-shocked from the quickfire Germany double. Still, he provided very little up front, with just eight touches in 24 minutes of action. He featured his usual pressing, and came close to scoring once on a messy chance that Germany just barely managed to clear, but otherwise he didn't quite cause the opposing back line problems to open spaces up for teammates.\n75th min: Johnny Cardoso \u2014 6\nJohnny Cardoso only had 15 minutes at the end to showcase his abilities, but it begged the question why he or Lennard Maloney weren't the ones introduced at halftime instead of Luca de la Torre. Cardoso lost possession just once in his 10 touches and completed a tackle, although he was also dribbled past a few times as well.\n75th min: Kevin Paredes \u2014 5\nWith 10 touches in his 15 minutes of action towards the end of a mucked up game of numerous substitutions, Kevin Paredes didn't stand out, losing possession four times and completing four passes. Tough to evaluate his time on the field, but he didn't stand out.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Bonn, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-14 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":588}

During the summer, he emerged as a favored MVP candidate. As the Nuggets maintain their key lineup for another championship bid, Jokic consistently demonstrates his game prowess.\nLuka Doncic: Doncic, among the preseason favorites for the past three years, has seen his prospects decline due to the Mavericks' limited support in Dallas, as underscored by their recent playoff absence. Although no one doubts Doncic's skills, questions about the Mavericks' contention capabilities persist.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo: Last season, Milwaukee's surprising first-round departure against the Heat was notably influenced by Antetokounmpo's absence for much of the series. The two-time MVP, arguably the league's premier two-way player, is poised to rebound next season. At 28, in his prime, his resolve is stronger than ever following the Bucks' premature playoff exit.\nJoel Embiid: Reigning MVP Embiid remains a prominent figure among top contenders. Despite the Sixers' playoff setbacks, he dominated the regular season, leading in scoring and showcasing superior rim defense. If he remains injury-free, Embiid is poised to vie for his MVP status again, hopefully with a strengthened supporting cast.\nHow to bet on the NBA MVP\nBetting on the NBA MVP has never been easier, thanks to the number of NBA betting sites and apps now available.

But when is the best time? That comes down to your tolerance for risk versus reward.\nThe odds are so favorable when the lines for NBA Most Valuable Player are first released because the oddsmakers, like you, have very little information to work with.\nThey are basing their odds on past performance and expected future accomplishments, as well as the quality of the team around the top candidates for the award. Thus, the odds are quite favorable.\nWhile waiting for more information, such as a player\u2019s performance during the regular season, the lines shift and become less favorable. That\u2019s because the oddsmakers are gathering information and applying new data and analytics to their lines to make them as accurate as possible.\nYou must decide which approach works best for your betting strategy as a bettor. Do you want to wager when the lines are released with little information at your disposal but the best potential return on your bet, or do you want to wait until you have more solid information to craft your MVP speculation?\nWho decides the NBA MVP winner?\nThe NBA MVP is selected annually by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters who vote for the players they believe are the best in the league.\nThis format, which started in 1980, sees each member of the panel vote for their top three players. Every first-place vote is worth five points, every second-place is worth three, and third-place is worth a single point.\nOne player rarely receives all of the first-place votes. That last happened in the 2015-16 season when Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors earned all possible first-place points.\nBecause there is no set criteria for awarding the regular-season NBA MVP, it\u2019s notoriously difficult to predict who will get the nod. There are often late-season shifts among the favorites, and there are even seasons in which the winner is considered an upset and more prominent players are snubbed.\nA recent history of NBA MVP winners\nHere is a list of the NBA MVPs since 2010.\nSeason Player Team 2022-23 Joel Embiid Philadelphia 76ers 2021-22 Nikola Joki\u0107 Denver Nuggets 2020-21 Nikola Joki\u0107 Denver Nuggets 2019-20 Giannis Antetokounmpo Milwaukee Bucks 2018-19 Giannis Antetokounmpo Milwaukee Bucks 2017-18 James Harden Houston Rockets 2016-17 Russell Westbrook Oklahoma City Thunder 2015-16 Steph Curry Golden State Warriors 2014-15 Steph Curry Golden State Warriors 2013-14 Kevin Durant Oklahoma City Thunder 2012-13 LeBron James Miami Heat 2011-12 LeBron James Miami Heat 2010-11 Derrick Rose Chicago Bulls\nWhat other NBA futures can I bet on?\nThe NBA MVP is far from the only NBA futures bet you can make. Here are some other popular NBA futures odds.\nThe NBA is the second-most popular sport in the US for betting, behind only the NFL. In turn, the bet types run deep.\nIn addition to pregame NBA betting lines such as moneylines, point spreads, and totals, you can bet on NBA player and team props, parlays, teasers, and more with legal and regulated online sportsbooks.\nNBA FAQ\nWhich player has the most MVP awards?\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar has the most-ever NBA MVP awards with six. He won three with the Milwaukee Bucks and three with the Los Angeles Lakers. Behind him, with five each, are Bill Russell (Boston Celtics) and Michael Jordan (Chicago Bulls).\nWhat is an NBA futures bet?\nFutures bets in any sport are wagers on an event usually weeks or months away. These are often settled at the end of a season or a tournament.\nWhere can I bet on the NBA MVP?\nEvery sports betting site will have NBA futures markets, including the NBA Most Valuable Player award, Rookie of the Year odds, regular-season win total OVER\/UNDER bets, and more.\n\nThis article, authored by Sam Eggleston, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-04 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":589}

Here\u2019s how to handle it, according to experts\n\nAttending meetings in pajama bottoms might seem like a job perk, but some remote workers have found that videoconferencing for work isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.\nIn the years since the COVID pandemic triggered a spike in telecommuting, many have complained of so-called \"Zoom fatigue.\"\nThought to be coined by Stanford University professor Jeremy Bailenson, the term refers to a level of exhaustion that comes with interacting with others on camera all throughout the day.\nREMOTE WORKERS RESIST MONDAY OFFICE HOURS, BUT BUILDING 'ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE' IS KEY, SAYS EXECUTIVE\nDr. Kyle Elliott, a tech career coach in San Francisco, defines Zoom fatigue as \"incessant tiredness or lack of energy as a result of spending a large quantity of time on Zoom.\"\nAdditional symptoms can include physical tension (including headaches, eye strain and stiffness), moodiness, a sense of disengagement or difficulty concentrating, according to Dr. Julia Corcoran, a licensed clinical psychologist and board-certified coach, who is currently serving as the director of clinical strategy and experience at Modern Health in San Francisco.\nThe challenge isn\u2019t exclusive to Zoom; other videoconferencing platforms can have the same effect.\nThe pandemic's effect\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, Zoom and other videoconferencing platforms \"exploded in popularity,\" said Dr. Carl Nassar, PhD, a professional counselor based in Denver, Colorado.\n\"We all found ourselves at home looking at the people we worked with, the people we went out for drinks with and the people in our extended family on a computer screen,\" he told Fox News Digital.\nWORKERS FIRED ON ZOOM: HERE'S HOW TO NAVIGATE A 'DEVASTATING' EXPERIENCE AND COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE\n\"Our work went virtual, our social life went virtual, our doctors' appointments went virtual, and even our intimate relationships sometimes went virtual,\" he said. \"And this meant a lot of time looking at each other on-screen instead of in person.\"\nLong after the pandemic, many of these habits have persisted.\n\"This video-ing of each other, it turns out, is far more tiring to humans than actually being together,\" said Nassar.\n\"One reason is that our brains are wired for actual in-person interactions, not wired for interactions on the screen.\"\nImpacts of Zoom fatigue\nWhile video calls can be convenient, Elliott warned that staring at a computer or phone screen for extended periods of time can result in negative mental health consequences .\n\"Zoom fatigue can aggravate stress, anxiety and burnout among workers,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"Our brains are wired for actual in-person interactions, not wired for interactions on the screen.\"\n\"Some people share that spending so much time interacting on screens makes it difficult to interact in real life.\"\nCAN YOU AVOID END-OF-THE-YEAR CAREER BURNOUT? JOB EXPERTS REVEAL SECRETS\nCorcoran agreed, noting that many report feeling livelier, happier and more active during in-person meetings.\n\"Because video platforms artificially limit our perspective, we miss the cues we\u2019re used to from live, in-person interactions,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"As social beings, we\u2019re highly attuned to these cues, and it takes more work for us to look for and process them in the virtual environment, leading to the fatigue we experience.\"\nEven beyond the workplace, Elliott noted that people are using video in more personal contexts than ever before, such as sharing reels on social media and calling loved ones on FaceTime.\n\"Because video platforms artificially limit our perspective, we miss the cues we\u2019re used to from live, in-person interactions.\"\n\"This can further exacerbate the problem if you're already spending a significant portion of your day on Zoom,\" he said.\n\"All these video-based calls can quickly lead to video fatigue if you're not mindful and take care to protect your mental health and well-being .\"\nStrategies that can help\nJust because a meeting is scheduled on Zoom or a similar video conferencing platform doesn't mean you need to be on video for the call, Elliott pointed out.\n\"When it makes sense, particularly if it's a large meeting where your input will be less frequent or nonexistent, you might opt to turn your video off from time to reduce Zoom fatigue,\" he advised.\nThe expert also recommended taking adequate breaks away from the computer, even if it's for just a few minutes, throughout the day.\n\"It can be tempting, but try to avoid looking at another screen, such as your phone, during this break, since you want to avoid swapping one digital toxin for another,\" Elliott said.\nFor those leading a video meeting, Corcoran suggested starting with a quick off-camera stretch break or mindfulness exercise to increase attention and focus.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"Whenever you\u2019re able, suggest audio-only meetings that don\u2019t require screens so people can do things they would naturally do in an in-person setting, like move around or look out a window,\" she advised.\n\"Walking away from our screens can reduce the urge to multitask, reduce eye fatigue and increase our capacity to move around.\"\nTurning off the self-view option can also be helpful, Corcoran said \u2014 \"it can be particularly distracting and draining because we\u2019re not used to seeing our own images so much.\"\nAs the use of video platforms is still relatively new for many professionals, Corcoran noted that the long-term effects aren\u2019t yet known.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"That being said, we know that constant feelings of fatigue, exhaustion and physical strain or tension do correlate with negative mental health outcomes,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s important to take steps to reduce Zoom fatigue before it leads to things like chronic stress or burnout.\"\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-12-01 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":590}
{"title":"The best tabletop RPGs we played in 2023","context":"## The best tabletop RPGs we played in 2023\n\nAfter more than a decade of going on and on about the \u201cboard gaming renaissance,\u201d it\u2019s safe to say that tabletop role-play is finally having its moment in the spotlight. But while Dungeons & Dragons\u2019 OGL fiasco has clearly lit a fire under many players eager to make a change, the fact of the matter is that a sizeable cohort of writers and designers have been toiling away at excellent games for years now. Their tireless efforts have yielded a bumper crop of excellent, some might say genre-defining, TTRPGs. Just like board games, a few modern classics have also cropped up: Look no further than The Quiet Year and The One Ring, both making their second appearance on this list.\nJust as before, Polygon asked nearly two dozen writers, designers, presenters, actors, and personalities from around the world of tabletop gaming to share with our readers the TTRPGs that made an impact on them and their players this year. Here\u2019s what we found.\nCity of Winter\nLinda Codega, Ennie Award-winning entertainment journalist\nMy friends and I still talk about the weekend we spent playing City of Winter. With lightweight rules but a heavy emphasis on the kind of ephemera usually reserved for much crunchier games, creating space for this game is almost as important as who you chose to play it with. Characters travel along a cloth map that illustrates a landscape with only barest indications of topography; the focus instead relies on themes of assimilation, diaspora, and \u2014 most importantly to the narrative \u2014 baggage. As a family of immigrants (bound by blood or by choice), players describe their home, their traditions, and then, as a darkness comes from the west side of the map, they leave it all behind, choosing what traditions and rituals they pick up from the places they visit and what they hold on to from their homeland. As far as games go, there are probably very few out there that require such a strict fidelity to the road laid out before you, but City of Winter uses this structure to facilitate the kind of deeply resonant character arcs and development that many role-players crave in their games. An astoundingly complex game, bringing your best stories to the table will leave you with a sense of loss and belonging that seem to walk together, hand in hand.\nDead After Dinner\nJason Morningstar, owner, creative director, and lead designer at Bully Pulpit Games\nJenn Martin\u2019s game Dead After Dinner combines the relentless procedural revelation of For the Queen with Knives Out-style murder mystery, and it is endlessly hilarious. Everyone is part of a miserable family stuffed with resentment, somebody is getting killed, there will be uncomfortable questions, and a murderer will definitely be revealed. Or will they? Dead After Dinner is a truly pick-up-and-play murder mystery that will delight you and your scenery-chewing friends.\nDesperation\nTim Hutchings, game designer and academic\nThe best game I\u2019ve played this year is a tie between Desperation by Jason Morningstar and Orestes\u2019 Choice by Susanne Vejdemo. Desperation is a card-driven TTRPG with a marvelous mechanic: Players draw a card with a bit of spoken text on it and then assign those words to one of the characters in play. It is so dang smart and makes for rich yet tight storytelling as the cards force new contexts for the actions of the characters.\nThe game comes with two dark American Gothic-flavored scenarios: a starving Kansas town locked in a brutal winter and a cursed fishing boat lost in the north Pacific. The faux woodcuts by Jabari Weathers and Brennen Reece are wonderful to look upon and convey the game\u2019s tone as much as the flavorful card text.\nMy best game experience was Orestes\u2019 Choice, a LARP by Susanne Vejdemo. It\u2019s the first heavy-duty chamber LARP I\u2019ve played since the pandemic; it reset my brain and helped me remember what I value in play. Players continuously swap roles as they play through a very queer Greek myth in which young Orestes returns home and must decide whether to kill his treacherous mother and father-in-law. Never have I planned a murder with such erotically charged practice stabbing.\nDungeon Crawl Classics\nThilo Graf of AAW Games\nI run and play a ton of different RPG systems, but precious few have had such a tremendous and lasting impact on my design and games as Dungeon Crawl Classics by Goodman Games.\nWith aesthetics influenced by all-time greats like Leiber and Moorcock, volatile magic, a relatively flat power curve for a d20-based game, and an emphasis on the skill of the players, as opposed to primarily rewarding the crafting of effective builds, DCC is a joy to run and play. It is not as much of a heroic power fantasy as D&D 5e or Pathfinder, but neither is it as minimalist as many old-school games. With fickle gods, mutating magics, lucky scoundrels, and ferocious fighters, DCC feels like playing through a Bal-Sagoth or Eternal Champion song. It\u2019s also easy to pick up if your group has any experience with D&D\u2019s third edition or Pathfinder. DCC rocks! Its focus on simple, impactful rules was a core design inspiration for the (almost system-neutral) Survivalist\u2019s Guide to Spelunking for 5e, a book I wrote with Douglas Niles and Stephen Yeardley. It warms my heart to know that DCC authors, judges, and players use the book as well!\nDungeons & Dragons\nMike Haracz, corporate R&D chef and host of Heroes\u2019 Feast\nI\u2019m lucky enough to be in the seventh year of a homebrew Dungeons & Dragons campaign, one I play with friends locally in the Chicagoland area. Our campaign is called The Heartsguard Saga, and it\u2019s based off Deven Rue\u2019s map of a place called Euphoros. My players are at around level 15 and I frequently give them a variety of amazing and unique gear that I\u2019ve dreamed up all on my own... which they go on to forget they have, and never use. We used to play in person, but since the pandemic I run the game virtually online from my house. I put a camera hovering over my gaming mat, and make a labeled grid for the players so they call out, \u201cMove me from A5 to B10.\u201d During important rolls, I even make my players face their camera toward their dice for added suspense!\nPetrana Radulovic, entertainment reporter\nI\u2019d wanted to play Dungeons & Dragons since I was in high school, but I never knew how to get into it. Thankfully, in the doldrums of 2020, someone I knew knew someone who knew someone (that\u2019s literally what the connection was) who was interested in running a game. That kicked off my D&D career, but was this year that everything finally clicked in my brain and it went from a hobby I enjoyed to one that I spend every free minute of my spare time thinking about.\nPart of it is finally having reliable groups. After some initial shuffling of members, in 2023 I\u2019ve been blessed to have not one but two separate D&D groups, both with enthusiastic members who are committed to at least trying to meet regularly. And yes, part of it is Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, which helped me to understand some of the more complicated D&D mechanics and just generally made me very excited about combat in a way I never was before.\nI\u2019ve still yet to actually have a game in person! My groups are spread out across North America, but I\u2019m hoping to manifest an in-person session soon. Here\u2019s to 2024 being an even better D&D year for me.\nEating Oranges in the Shower\nSam Dunnewold, Dice Exploder podcast\nThe Golden Cobra challenge is always a deep well of exciting (and free!) new larps from the bleeding edge of the hobby. This year, like a song that\u2019s stuck in my head, I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about Eating Oranges in the Shower by Hazel Anneke Dixon, a game about exactly what it sounds like. You play as members of a group chat who discover the \/r\/ShowerOrange subreddit, a real community dedicated to the \u201cliberating\u201d act of eating an orange while taking a shower. You each decide to try this out for yourself before returning to compare notes, and because it\u2019s a LARP, you actually go do the thing.\nThis game is so strange and delightful, not to mention delicious. The principal act is compelling on its own. It feels forbidden somehow, even as it\u2019s obviously harmless.\nBut Dixon also captures something ephemeral and nostalgic about what it\u2019s like to be in a niche online community and group chat, and the magic of making discoveries in those spaces. On an increasingly centralized internet, that experience has become rare, and I miss it.\nExquisite Biome\nEverest Pipkin, game and software developer\nI\u2019ve heard Exquisite Biome described as \u201cSpore for the kitchen table,\u201d and if that isn\u2019t a great pitch I don\u2019t know what is.\nComing from Caro Asercion (game designer) and Si Sweetman (illustrator), Exquisite Biome is in the world-building TTRPG tradition, but it focuses specifically on ecological biomes and the creatures that populate them. Through short generative prompts tied to a deck of playing cards, you build and witness the lives of animals far beyond the edge of our own world. Playing Exquisite Biome feels a little bit like being David Attenborough on an alien planet.\nWith beautiful, evocative art and short, easy-to-parse rules, Exquisite Biome is my go-to \u201cwhat if we made up some weird little guys and set them in motion for an hour\u201d game. And truly, what higher calling is there?\nFetch My Blade\nDid you know you can play one of the best tabletop RPGs whenever you want, without any scheduling nightmares or unfeasible time commitments? You can when you play Fetch My Blade, a solo journaling role-playing game created by Kelly Tran and Ethan Yen!\nIn Fetch My Blade, you role-play as a friendly or fierce dog of a retired legendary sword master. Create your character by choosing one of six dog breeds, including shih tzu, corgi, mastiff, border collie, husky, and chihuahua, or select your own! Determine three truths about your master and aid them when a mysterious stranger challenges them to a duel. It is up to you to go on a perilous quest of your own to retrieve your master\u2019s fabled weapon in time for their final duel.\nThroughout this transformational quest, you use three six-sided dice to resolve mechanics for racing against time, overcoming treacherous encounters, and uncovering new truths about your master\u2019s shrouded past. Embrace your inner doggy, buy this 17-page game, and begin your adventure today! Swiftly now \u2014 your master\u2019s fate is in your paws!\nHome\nWesley \u201cNox\u201d Crowe, aka Noxweiler Berf, creative director for Hunters Entertainment\nDoug Levandowski and Yeonsoo Julian Kim\u2019s Home drew me in immediately, and has been one of my most recommended tabletop role-playing games. If you know me or my work, then the fact that it\u2019s a horror game probably won\u2019t come as much of a surprise. It\u2019s a haunted house exploration simulator that can be played with a full table of players or alone as a solo journaling experience. It uses custom tarot cards and a whiteboard to track your character\u2019s progress as they dare to shine a light on the chilling danger of a variety of potential scenarios full of ghosts and other dark entities.\n\u200bThe action is propelled through the use of the custom tarot cards \u2014 the Night Deck \u2014 which are filled with prompts that require the creative interaction of players. Each round, players take turn as the director of the story and guide the narrative forward using the guidance of the cards to describe and draw each room of the haunted house that they are exploring. The game encourages collaboration in determining the story\u2019s direction and does a remarkable job of steering the action forward without a single game master putting forth the often large amount of preparation that role-playing games usually require.\n\u200bAs the game progresses, characters collect wounds and push past the terrors that await them and work together to resolve the mysteries at the root of each horror. The solo mode of the game plays just as smoothly as the group experience, leaning on the prompts and player\u2019s imagination to create a journal documenting the character\u2019s harrowing encounter.\nI can\u2019t recommend it enough. Grab a copy of the PDF, turn down the lights, and start mapping your own haunted house!\nThe Luminant Age\nI became an immediate fan of Luminant Age after being invited to be a contributor. What caught my eye at the start was the Four Humanities ancestries named Blood, Clay, Silk, and Horn. This year, many of my Thursday mornings have been a whirlwind of weird as our playtest party encounter teleporting flickrats, heal via esseweaving, and get hunted down by cultists in stryx bonemasques. The city we\u2019re in, Ourichor, is built on giant oil-rig-like platforms in the open ocean. There are no sun nor stars, but three moons... that you\u2019re allowed to see.\nAlso, did I mention the predominant religion featured, the Angelites, memorialize their dead by preserving their eyeballs? You can even wear them as mourning jewelry.\nThis Pathfinder 2nd edition-compatible setting has been as enchantingly addictive as the fictional ichor that propelled Ourichor into the renaissance era that the project is named after. While there are only two exquisitely illustrated supplements on creatures and equipment available currently, I recommend those with a love of the unusual to keep an eye out for more in the years to come, such as the upcoming Paragons of Luminant Age that introduces NPCs and explores their motives through the four moons.\nMarvel Multiverse Role-playing Game\nAs a role-player, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking for a good lightweight superhero RPG. I\u2019ve tried quite a few but had yet to find one that really hit the mark for me until I tried Marvel Multiverse Role-playing Game. I have to say, I was initially dubious about this game but it has blown me out of the water. The game is utterly devoted to giving the players the feeling of playing a hero in the Marvel universe with tons of cool powers and power categories based on key Marvel heroes like Spider-Man and the Hulk. The system is easy, streamlined, and really carries the four-color comic book flavor. Probably one of the coolest aspects of the game is that while there is an exhaustive list of Marvel heroes and villains at the back of the book, you can create your own hero with their own power set and use that \u201cbestiary\u201d of heroic and villainous figures as allies and enemies in your own heroic adventures. For those of us who\u2019ve always wanted to make their own X-Gene Mutant, Spirit of Vengeance, or Spidersona, this is a must-have book that will bring hours of enjoyment.\nMasks of the Masks\nSuperhero comics, for all their many flaws, remain my life\u2019s great passion. That\u2019s why, of all the games I\u2019ve played this year, the one I want to shout about from the rooftops is Masks of the Masks by Hazel Amber Goswick. The game is an incredible piece of art: a tabletop RPG presented as a fully illustrated comic book, an homage to Bronze Age superhero stories just as Watchmen did, that critically explores and examines the violence inherent in its medium. It\u2019s an absolute joy to behold as you flip through it; you can feel the love, consideration, and attention to detail dripping off of every move and every panel. Then, in play, it\u2019s a revelation; a brilliant blend of Belonging Outside Belonging and Powered by the Apocalypse that builds on some of the luminaries of both systems to create something that just sings. Plus, it has some of the most wicked advancement mechanics I\u2019ve run into in years, that both add to the play experience while heightening the ever-looming sense of dread and tragedy that\u2019s so essential to comics of that time period. Cannot recommend enough.\nThe Monster Overhaul\nThe Monster Overhaul, by Skerples, reimagines not just the monsters, but the very notion of what a bestiary can and should be. The book is divided into 20 categories, each containing 10 critters that hew to a theme. The categories are unusual: There is \u201cDragons,\u201d of course, but also \u201cSummer\u201d and \u201cA Wizard Did It.\u201d \u201cSummer\u201d monsters include the Froghemoth and Pyromancers. Some of these may sound similar to classic D&D monsters, others are entirely new. Tables galore help build and flesh out encounters. \u201cSummer\u201d has a set of generic swamp hexes; other entries have lairs and dungeons. There is an entire flowchart table for populating a megadungeon. Every page of this book is designed to make the reader think about monsters, how to make them feel new, or to recontextualize them, or to simply subvert player expectations. Like all great RPG supplements, The Monster Overhaul not only offers answers for these questions and more, it also teaches the reader how to continue answering them long after these published tables and suggestions are exhausted. A monstrous achievement that should be on every GM\u2019s shelf.\nBonus: Reach of the Roach God\nReach of the Roach God is the hardcover high-watermark of A Thousand Thousand Islands (ATTI), a series of zines, that presents a system-agnostic setting inspired by the folklore of Southeast Asia. Odoyoq, the roach god, senses new ways it can insinuate itself into the lives of non-roachkind. The three schemes are presented as both traditional adventures and as collections of facts \u2014 about the setting, about the people living there and their motivations, about the desires of the god and the machinations of its agents. Events will quickly throw a small village, a monastery, and a necropolis into chaos. Two gazetteers and a sourcebook on the roaches follow, giving the GM ample material to expand the campaign. All this is wrapped in Munkao\u2019s fantastically disgusting artwork. His vistas and cultural portraits are gorgeous, but when he brings his talents to bear on feelers and chitin and filth, the results are revolting in the best possible way. Sadly, this is likely the final installment in the ATTI series and unlikely to be reprinted, so get this book while you can!\nMonsterhearts\nFiguring out what to talk about proved trickier than I expected. A lot of the things I played this year were playtests or previews for things not out yet, which would feel more like a humblebrag than a recommendation, or were my own games which were great to play but would feel a bit weird and self-indulgent to suggest as the \u201cbest.\u201d\nA really pleasant TTRPG memory I had from this year was playing Monsterhearts for the first time in three years. This was one of the first games I ever played (for ages afterwards I kept calling playbooks in every game \u201cskins\u201d). I played a one-shot with some friends I was reconnecting with and we mostly group game mastered. We played a gang of messy screw-ups who didn\u2019t hugely get along, my character had traded her old gender to the fae over the summer, and we tried to investigate a potential monster hunter, a NPC most of our characters found too cool to talk to. There was a gag about someone doing a club remix of \u201cDanny Boy\u201d at a memorial service and the group chat with those friends is still named \u201cDanny Boyz (The Pipes, The Pipes).\u201d\nM\u00f6rk Borg\nJasmine Bhullar, writer, content creator, executive producer of DesiQuest\nOf the games I delved into this year, although several afforded hours of entertainment, I felt myself repeatedly returning to one in particular. Although M\u00f6rk Borg was released in 2020, it was only in 2023 that I happily stumbled upon it and was able to somehow get a table together to run a game. The book itself has a stunning and distinct art style that immediately transports you into the doom metal fantasy of the setting; but that\u2019s only a small part of its allure.\nUnlike many TTRPGs that one merely has aspirations of playing one day, M\u00f6rk Borg does everything in its power to make the game easy to run. Although it\u2019s a short read, no line is wasted. Even item descriptions are dripping with hints at nefarious deeds one must have done to acquire them. The optional classes are an absolute delight for those of us that savor the idea of playing the unsavory. From the esoteric introverts that choose to make their hovel far from prying eyes to the unfortunate discarded-at-birth cutthroats who\u2019ve had to scratch out a living any way they can, there is something for everyone. There is always the option of creating something more tailor-made if none of the classes are appealing, but I appreciate that M\u00f6rk Borg offers beginner-friendly ideas and archetypes to help you create something that fits right into the gritty setting. Furthermore, in the process of putting a game together, I found a glut of free online tools from dungeon generators to NPC character sheet generators that made game prep a breeze. I find myself coming back to this game again and again with each game session only giving me ideas for future campaigns. I know I\u2019m not alone in this feeling given the number of M\u00f6rk Borg-compatible games that have sprung up this year, from Pirate Borg to Chris Lockey\u2019s upcoming Abyss of Hallucinations.\nI\u2019m Sorry Did You Say Street Magic\nMadison Durham, writer and journalist, staff writer at Reviewed\nTo me, some of the most joyful moments in tabletop gaming come from the experience of creative collaboration \u2014 the magic of making something new with friends, be it a narrative, a character, a world, or in this case, a city. I\u2019m Sorry Did You Say Street Magic by Caro Asercion is a GM-less city-building game, played between a group of two to six people with a stack of index cards and your favorite writing utensils. The whimsically illustrated rulebook lays out the tools by which you\u2019ll lay bricks for your city, weaving together your ideas and your fellow players\u2019 to establish Landmarks, Residents, and Neighborhoods, all on a quest to find the city\u2019s true names. It\u2019s a beautifully simple game, guided by a Compass, which can be anything \u2014 literally. It\u2019s almost impossible for me to capture the magic of this game with words, because each session we played was so entirely unique, from the verdant turtle-city in the sky we built out in stages to the haunted shell of a city we later used as our D&D setting. It\u2019s a perfect game full stop, but especially for those seeking to rekindle their creativity, or simply to sit down and create with friends.\nTriangle Agency\n\u201cI laughed so hard my face hurt.\u201d \u2014me, 10 minutes after my first session of Triangle Agency\nI love a game with style and a clear, fun point of view, so I\u2019ve been a fan of Triangle Agency since I picked up its player guide in beta form earlier this year (to prep for writing a published adventure for the game). Written in the form of a cheerful, slightly threatening employee handbook, the Field Agent Manual guides you through the creation of your supernaturally powered character, then gets you ready for your role finding and containing Anomalies that threaten the nature of reality. After your team\u2019s morning meeting, of course.\nBeyond the style of the materials, though, playing the game was an absolute blast. The mix of mundane life, weird occurrences, and corporate BS created a fast-paced game experience that was playful and easy to understand (just count those threes!), got every player invested in our characters and each other (even in a group of total strangers), and allowed the whole table to lean into both the strange and ridiculous nature of life. This year, it was just the kind of joy that I needed.\n2023 was a personal tabletop gold mine. We finally got Brennan Lee Mulligan\u2019s first official 5e homebrew; I discovered tabletop meetup hub and game master meat market StartPlaying.Games, where you can, as I have, hire a handsome Scottish man to D&D dominate you and your friends every week; and I played a ton of my new favorite party game, As You \u2019Wich. It\u2019s a dead-simple hand-builder that, for me at least, boils down to convincing your nephews to eat disgusting sandwiches (hair, mustard, and broken glass on marble rye, absolutely not toasted). But the fresh grand dame of my tabletop world is Triangle Agency, a gleaming, razor-sharp new TTRPG that feels like a cross between The X-Files, Annihilation, and playing Control with the Robert Anton Wilson mod turned on.\nIn Triangle Agency, you are super-abled agents investigating and stopping ontological anomalies from destroying reality, with mechanics that feel like the platonic ideal mix of analytic crunch and grand narrative weirdness. And my god, it is gorgeous, with jaw-dropping art and design that puts it on the same shelf as Wanderhome and M\u00f6rk Borg. The full game ships early in 2024, but you can get the digital rules and start playing right now, for the low, low price of \u201cwhatever you think is appropriate.\u201d\nTwilight: 2000\nCharlie Hall, senior editor, tabletop\nI firmly believe that tabletop role-play should always take into account the audience that sits down at the table to play. That\u2019s part of the reason why I hate best-of lists for this particular category of games in particular. What difference does it make if something scores highly on some arbitrary rubric if it doesn\u2019t resonate with the people in your community? And so I look at year-end lists like these as a kind of menu, boards of fare that clever game masters can use to pick just the right flavor for a given table.\nFor me this year was all about reconnecting with the other dads in my neighborhood after years spent locked inside during the pandemic. I spun up a Discord that we used to organize friendly games of Call of Duty\u2019s DMZ mode, organized a few visits to the local brewery to catch up make new connections, and generally just tried to get awkward, middle-aged men accustomed to seeing each other socially again. One night I decided to bust out Twilight: 2000, and it was an instant hit.\nTwilight: 2000 is a game about surviving in the aftermath of a fictional nuclear conflict in the heart of Europe. It\u2019s an alternate history where the Cold War went hot, swallowing up an entire United States Marine division. Players take on the role of soldiers and other hangers-on just trying to make it out alive. The heady mix of dice-driven gunplay and a playing-card-style encounter creation makes it easy to run. But the fun begins even before that with character generation, which uses old school randomized tables to simulate an entire military career. If you\u2019re looking to get your video gaming buddies around the table for something that doesn\u2019t require a headset or shouting down pre-teens in a glitchy public lobby, the all-inclusive starter set comes highly recommended.\nProject ECCO\nIt\u2019s a near-impossible task to get a consistent group together, so solo TTRPGs have become my primary method of gaming. However, the barrier for me is finding a game with a balance of narrative and mechanics that isn\u2019t overwhelmingly crunchy, but also isn\u2019t open-ended to the point of choice paralysis. For me, Project ECCO found that balance.\nA story of time travel and cosmic horror, Project ECCO is easy to get into and relatively quick to play (three to 10 hours per game). Between the hundreds of narrative prompts, unlocking various time travel \u201cdevices\u201d (coins, dice, tarot cards, etc.), and the absolutely stunning layout, this is one of my favorite TTRPGs, period.\nPlayed in the pages of a yearly planner, Project ECCO hits every beat of a good time-travel story: time loops and timeline divergences, a shady and controlling Time Travel Agency, and an unknowable cosmic Entity consuming spacetime. As you play, you (literally) burn through the days of your planner, creating an artifact, marked and changed by the telling of your agent\u2019s story.\nFor an example of gameplay and a masterfully produced actual play, listen to the Project ECCO miniseason of My First Dungeon with game designer Elliot Davis.\nThe Quiet Year\nEm Friedman, associate professor of English at Auburn University and Polygon contributor\nLook, The Quiet Year appeared not once but twice on last year\u2019s roundup, I know. Jay Dragon praised its elegance and Keerthi Sridharan noted the way their game group used it as a prologue (as Friends at the Table and The Adventure Zone have popularized), and it\u2019s a standard early on in my TTPRG class. But for me it was the standout game of this year because after running it for my niece (then 4) and nephew (8), my nephew asked that I run \u201cthe skulls game\u201d for his entire class. While not intended for a dozen grade schoolers, it turns out the mechanics of The Quiet Year \u2014 which ensure everyone gets to have their turn unimpeded by the commentary of others, ritualizes dissent and discussion, as well as having a glorious sheet of blank paper to draw the zombie chicken monster friend of your dreams \u2014 turned out to be a perfect framework to imagine how to work together. All that, and it fits in my pocket.\nWhat Dust Remains\nDanny Quach, Digital Thiccness, TTRPG writer, designer, and performer\nDespite my generally sunny disposition, big smile, and boisterous laughter (as well as being deemed the internet\u2019s emotional support himbo), I love all of my emotions \u2014 the good, bad, and ugly. I love emo\/screamo\/post-hardcore music and exploring the darkness through lyrics. I love the gothic and macabre, finding comfort in losing something you once had. I love horror movies and the inherent queerness of being an outcast being pushed to their limits. And I love games that explore themes of melancholy and loss. Enter: What Dust Remains by 2022 Diana Jones Emerging Designer award winner Bianca Canoza \u2014 aka Momatoes. Taught by the designer herself, I got to play this at Big Bad Con 2023 with two other strangers who quickly became co-collaborators in this tragic world we built in under two hours that told a story of a legacy that wasn\u2019t quite within reach. Impassioned and intriguing card-prompted questions along with focused, intense moments of dice rolls that helped move the story along, What Dust Remains challenged me to discover, explore, and sit in moments of despair and desperation and had the whole table contemplating what parts of us are we going to sacrifice to leave a legacy that would be bigger than we could ever be behind.\nThe Wildsea\nEarlier this year, I searched for the perfect system to kickstart my new actual-play campaign with three \u201cmust-haves\u201d in mind: a vivid world, rich character options, and simple but punchy rules. Through sheer accident (providence?), I stumbled upon The Wildsea by Felix Isaacs and Mythworks \u2014 and it was love at first sight.\nIn this game, players embody wildsailors: swashbuckling adventurers who traverse a strange and vibrant world made of fantastical vegetation. The character generation process encourages delightfully bizarre concepts like pinwolf-taming sharpshooters trapped in amber, omen-speaking moth chefs, or even collections of a thousand spiders wearing skin suits. The mechanics are structured around a d6 dice pool system with bands of success that generate interesting outcomes no matter what you roll.\nThe beautifully illustrated rulebook not only allowed me to add my own twists, but actively endorsed it, with multiple sections dedicated to alternate ways of running encounters and ideas for creating your own unique lore. My players and I had an absolute BLAST playing The Wildsea both on and off stream, and we were stoked (but not surprised!) when it won an Ennie this year. If you\u2019re looking for a narratively focused game with an imaginative world and mechanics that inspire cinematic play, then give The Wildsea a shot!\n\nThis article, authored by Charlie Hall, was published by Polygon on 2023-12-13 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":591}
{"title":"Rogue Trader\u2019s role-playing embraces the brutality and freedom of Warhammer 40K","context":"## Rogue Trader\u2019s role-playing embraces the brutality and freedom of Warhammer 40K\n\n\u201cIn the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.\u201d That\u2019s the tagline of Warhammer 40,000, one of the most over-the-top and brutal sci-fi settings around. But even in a merciless, brutal dystopia that grinds its people into dust, some get to enjoy being on the top of the food chain. Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is about the perils and pleasures of being atop that particular hierarchy.\nRogue Traders in 40K are freelance explorers, scouting the far frontiers of the Imperium of Man. It\u2019s a risky career, but it comes with luxurious rewards: agency, freedom, power, and a giant flagship. As the player, I explore a system of the Imperium with a loyal crew of companions, making impactful choices and determining the fate of those around me.\nRogue Trader is a computer role-playing game in the vein of Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 or Pillars of Eternity. I create my custom protagonist, determining stats and bonuses based on my backstory, home world, and so on. I\u2019m then thrust into a high-pressure job interview as a potential heir to a Rogue Trader aboard her flagship. Little do we know that there\u2019s a coup in the works, and traitors aboard the ship. After a deadly struggle against heretics and demons, I ascend to the position of Rogue Trader. I\u2019m the captain now, and I get to decide how to run my ship.\nThis is a vast game, with tons of features you\u2019d expect from a CRPG \u2014 companions (each with their own narrative paths and conversation trees), top-down strategic combat, and branching choices that impact the world around you. I get to make choices all day \u2014 in fact, that\u2019s part of the gig of a Rogue Trader. Some are more important than others; whenever I get to specific points in the story, I can choose from one of three major paths. Dogmatic choices exult the God-Emperor and loathe the mutant and the witch, the Heretical options pursue corruptive power, and the Ionoclast path is the closest thing we have to modern-day \u201cgood guy\u201d morality.\nAfter the events of the tutorial, my beautiful voidship is run down and my staff is struggling. As the newly anointed Rogue Trader, I have to trek around the various planets of the Koronus Expanse to get a new Navigator, fix my ship up, and avoid any major diplomatic incidents with the locals. My voidship is the size of a modern city; I\u2019m as much a governor as a captain, and I have to manage the ship, its cargo, and its many occupants.\nIn the process of getting back on my feet, I uncover a nefarious cult and a deep conspiracy. It\u2019s not an easy job, but I\u2019m blessed with a handful of companions from the Imperium to help me out. I can call on them to unlock doors or perform other environmental checks, but they come most in handy in combat.\nWhen I meet opposition, it\u2019s deeply satisfying to control my troops in a turn-based battle. Each fight takes place on a grid; it\u2019s very similar to Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 or even XCOM 2. Some positions provide cover, while others are out in the open. Friendly fire is also a very real concern. An arc of auto-fire from a bolter, or a Navigator\u2019s third eye opening, can harm friend as well as foe. My Rogue Trader is a sniper, and she would be lost without her Senechal taking the front lines. There\u2019s a lot of firepower at my disposal, and it\u2019s mostly quite satisfying to use \u2014 even if I occasionally shred my poor Senechal with a devastating AOE.\nI can chat with the companions between battles, learning more about their pasts. Most of them have deep and dark secrets I can uncover with a little time or patience, and they have fascinating stories to tell. Abelard, my Senechal, is a guy who sucks morally but will back me to the absolute hilt. I grew to love hearing about his days in the Imperial Navy, and he was the one guy I felt like I could trust. Augusta, a Sister of Battle, starts as a one-note zealot, but cracks form in that facade when I learn about her past and doubts. Cassia and Pasqal both represent two sub-factions in 40K, and they have lots to share about the Navigators and Tech-Priests.\nMy absolute favorite companion is Marazhai Aezyrraesh, a dark space elf who feeds off the suffering of sentient beings. He\u2019s cruel, depraved, and an absolute hoot. Yes, he may flay a few too many people for my tastes, but he\u2019s the best companion to bring to a party.\nIn the grand scheme of things, this is one of the most complete and detailed explorations of the 40K universe you can find. The game is an homage to the Warhammer 40K RPGs from Fantasy Flight Games, including Rogue Trader and Dark Heresy. I spent years as a teenager and young adult poring over these sourcebooks (which Rogue Trader is inspired by), learning more about the tiny details of life in the Imperium. Developer Owlcat Games has paid the same attention to every detail of the Koronus Expanse. I delve into ancient facilities staffed by tech-priests of the Machine God, the hostile xenos city of Commorragh, or massive cities built to honor the God-Emperor of Mankind.\nI love the characters, the environments, the writing, the lore, and the flow of battles. But I have concerns with the game\u2019s pacing. By the end of the first chapter, I had leveled up 16 times. Each level offered marginal rewards, like being able to move slightly farther during the character\u2019s turn in combat or having a higher parry chance when being attacked. A slow drip-feed system means each level feels less important, and even though I\u2019m growing stronger, I don\u2019t get that sense of long-term satisfaction.\nIt\u2019s especially frustrating to hit a roadblock like the one at the end of Act 1, where an incredibly tough boss rolls out of nowhere and spanks my crew \u2014 and I can\u2019t leave to go grind experience somewhere else. I eventually found out a way to cheese the fight by focusing on my melee fighters\u2019 positioning, but it took far too long banging my head against the wall. The victory tasted like ash in my mouth after all that frustration.\nVoidship combat is another aspect that feels clunky and frustrating. Like the squad-based skirmishes, naval encounters are also turn-based, where positioning is ultra important. Space naval battles should feel tense, but instead, I\u2019m mostly annoyed at having to continually rotate my ship and set up my zones of attack. I wish I could delegate these annoyances to my Senechal \u2014 to delegate the duties of character leveling and ship combat, the better to appreciate all of the things Rogue Trader is doing so well.\nRogue Trader is a dense, vast game, and much of it has clearly been crafted with love for the expansive lore of the 40K canon. While there are small annoyances and clunky features along the way, the political intrigue, cast of characters, and moral choices have me hooked. For 40K fans, this is a rare treat \u2014 a game that digs past the heroic facade of bolters and battles and taps into the grimdark dystopia that makes this particular sci-fi setting so damn compelling.\nWarhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader will be released on Dec. 7 on Windows PC.

{"title":"Pebble, the Twitter alternative previously known as T2, is shutting down","context":"## Pebble, the Twitter alternative previously known as T2, is shutting down\n\nThe grip Twitter, now called X, has on the market may be stronger than some believed. Unfortunately, that\u2019s led to the first casualty among Twitter alternatives, as the startup Pebble (formerly T2), is shutting down. The would-be X rival had grown a small but engaged community on its microblogging service that aimed to dupe Twitter\u2019s features, from its verification systems to functionality like DMs. But the company says they\u2019ve run out of time to make Pebble happen \u2014 the app maxed out at 3,000 daily active users, out of 20,000 registered users. That daily user figure fell to 1,000 daily users following its rebranding from T2.\nIn part, the sizable competition coming from other Twitter rivals was to blame, says co-founder and CEO Gabor Cselle, who had exits to Google and Twitter prior to starting Pebble.\n\u201cI think the competitive landscape evolved faster than we had thought,\u201d he explains. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that quite as many people \u2014 established organizations and newcomers \u2014 would try to do the same thing that we were doing and in very similar ways.\u201d\nToday, the market for Twitter alternatives is a crowded one, to say the least. There are numerous services for consumers to try, including the open source-based platform Mastodon, a soon-to-be decentralized system from Bluesky, plus smaller startups like Spill, Spoutible and Post, as well as a new app from Meta called Instagram Threads.\nThen, of course, there\u2019s the X factor to consider. The default platform for short posts retains some pull, despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 new owner Elon Musk\u2019s antics. Though the company may not have yet succeeded from a business and financial perspective, it\u2019s been hard for others to duplicate its function as a breaking news platform and place for spirited debates.\n\u201cI think Threads and others have encountered this as well,\u201d adds Pebble co-founder and CTO Michael Greer, previously Discord engineering head. \u201cThe durability of the network effect of Twitter is stronger than anticipated,\u201d he says.\nDespite these challenges, Pebble initially had decent retention. By week four, it was seeing retention rates of 30%, in fact. Its invite list was also working, as 60% of people who received a Pebble invite converted to become users. In addition, some 10,000 users arrived at that list from early press, like TechCrunch\u2019s coverage of its first outside funding \u2014 a $1.1 million angel round that included investors like former Google VP Bradley Horowitz, Android co-founder Rich Miner and the former CEO of Wikipedia, Katherine Maher. Data from Similarweb indicates the Pebble website topped 99,300 visits last month, indicating repeat usage.\nThe company\u2019s hypothesis was that consumers were hungry for a Twitter alternative that prioritized trust, safety and moderation from the start. To that end, Pebble\u2019s founding team included co-founder Sarah Oh, Twitter\u2019s former human rights advisor.\nPebble continues to believe its approach to moderation was correct, even if it was not ultimately a factor in driving growth.\n\u201cWe came in with a particular angle: kinder, safer. Trust and safety. And I think our approach to moderation that we did have on the site did work,\u201d says Cselle, adding that Pebble didn\u2019t have some of the issues other federated platforms faced. For example, TechCrunch reported that Bluesky earlier this year had strained its relationship with Black users, as it failed to crack down on bigotry on the site. Later, users on Bluesky were even creating usernames with racial slurs, and yet the platform didn\u2019t issue a public apology. Pebble never faced any such controversies.\nBut it may have positioned itself a little too far into the \u201ckindness\u201d territory, the founders now believe.\n\u201cWe were really seized by people saying they wanted something that felt safer, where they could speak openly without dogpiling,\u201d says Oh. \u201cAnd so we were confident that was an important thing to hit. Are there other things that are equally important and a great user experience? Yes.\u201d\n\u201cTwitter is you have real people\u2026saying real things,\u201d Oh continues. \u201cAt the expense of using a word that\u2019s overused, \u2018authentic.\u2019 And our theory was always if you can create a space where people really feel like they can let down their hair, then you would get that authentic content. We didn\u2019t quite get there,\u201d she admits.\nCselle agrees, noting that, perhaps, Pebble should have opened up enough space for disagreement to happen, while still drawing a hard line on the most disagreeable parts of running a Twitter-like platform.\n\u201cI think we could have maybe moved a little bit further towards that,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nice things that are said on Pebble, but maybe not enough breaking news. Not enough conversation.\u201d\nThere were other things that may have hurt Pebble\u2019s traction, too, including its lack of a native mobile app. As T2, the startup prioritized building for the web to be agile and more flexible, but lost out on the opportunities for discovery driven by the app stores. Notes Greer, \u201cthat might have been a mistake.\u201d\nIn retrospect, Cselle also questions if the rebranding from T2 to Pebble may have been an issue.\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering if the Pebble rebrand had actually softened the value prop[position] because T2 just encapsulated it so much \u2014 that it was really duplicative [of Twitter],\u201d he says.\nLike most startup shutdowns, the answer as to \u201cwhy\u201d is not any one thing but a combination of factors. For Pebble, that\u2019s certainly true. It was a perfect storm of competition, X\u2019s continued traction, the lack of a native app, a brand that didn\u2019t resonate and a space that was maybe a little too safe to be as addictive and as fun as the original.\nWith Pebble\u2019s winddown, being announced to users today at 9 AM PT, early adopters will have the option of exporting their Pebble archive as a zip file that loads a mini web page showcasing all their old posts. Pebble won\u2019t be directing users back to X however, or any other social network.\nAs for where the founders will now hang out?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe LinkedIn,\u201d Cselle jokes.\nPebble is also returning a small amount of the funds left over to its investors, more as a courtesy to show financial responsibility. The Pebble website will be shut down on November 1st and there aren\u2019t further plans for the IP at this time.\nThe founders don\u2019t regret their experience building Pebble, even though it didn\u2019t turn out as they hoped, they said.\nSays Cselle, \u201cOne thing that I learned is that there\u2019s absolutely an audience that wants to see a new kind of Twitter-like platform built and will ask for the features that Twitter has.\u201d He suspects the team might stay together to work on something new after Pebble wraps, taking the learnings from Pebble with them. That includes better communicating to users what great content should look like on a platform, and how they can win.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection point in social media,\u201d says Oh. \u201cWe had one hypothesis with T2 and Pebble. It obviously didn\u2019t pan out the way that we wanted it to. But I think we\u2019ll look back and see this past year is a really important turning point for the role that social media plays in our lives,\u201d she adds.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-24 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":593}
{"title":"Pittsburgh boy, 10, needs second liver transplant to save his life: \u2018Only possible through love\u2019","context":"## Pittsburgh boy, 10, needs second liver transplant to save his life: \u2018Only possible through love\u2019\n\nA Pittsburgh boy with a rare liver disease is fighting for his life \u2014 and his family is hoping for a second miracle to save him.\nLucas Goeller, now 10, was born with a rare, life-threatening condition called biliary atresia, which is a blockage that prevents bile from traveling from the liver to the gallbladder.\nEight years after he received his first transplant as a toddler, his transplanted organ is now failing again \u2014 and his life depends on receiving another donation.\nONE FAMILY DONATES FOUR KIDNEYS TO SAVE A NEW YORK MAN\u2019S LIFE: \u2018DEFIED ALL ODDS\u2019\nIn 2015, when he was just a toddler, the child's health declined rapidly.\nHe spent 18 months on the liver transplant list, getting sicker each week, and did not receive a single organ donation offer.\n\"He was on the brink of death, unable to walk or talk,\" said his mother, Jessica Goeller, in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\" God told me to start a Facebook page for him, and at the time I really wasn't into social media.\"\nThat page led to a viral national campaign \u2014 complete with local news stories and donated billboards \u2014 that attracted the attention of a Nebraska family.\nARKANSAS MILITARY VETERAN RECEIVES WORLD\u2019S FIRST WHOLE-EYE AND PARTIAL-FACE TRANSPLANT\nAnd in July of that year, at UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, little 2-year-old Lucas received the liver of 3-year-old Olivia Swedberg, who had passed away a day earlier of brain cancer .\n\"I'm in awe when someone can take their suffering and turn it into something beautiful by donating and giving someone a second chance,\" said Goeller.\nAfter that first transplant, her young son made a \"miraculous recovery,\" Goeller said.\nnext Image 1 of 2\nprev Image 2 of 2\nFor \"eight beautiful years,\" Goeller said, Lucas experienced a normal life as a happy, healthy boy .\n\"He was able to do things that he never could do before,\" she said. \"He went from watching out of windows to being an active participant in life.\"\n\"I'm in awe when someone can take their suffering and turn it into something beautiful by donating and giving someone a second chance.\"\nBut all of that changed this year, when his routine medical scans and blood work indicated that his liver had begun to fail.\n\"His failing liver is affecting his lung function and his ammonia levels,\" Goeller told Fox News Digital.\n\"That would be drastic for anyone, but for a child who's growing and cognitively developing, it is devastating to [his] development.\"\nDr. George Mazariegos, chief of pediatric transplantation at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said Lucas is experiencing some of the more subtle changes of liver failure.\nPIG HEART RECIPIENT'S \u2018LAST WISH\u2019 WAS TO HELP DOCTORS LEARN FROM PROCEDURE, DYING MAN SAID: \u2018WE WILL MISS HIM'\n\"Those include not being able to grow normally and not getting the proper levels of oxygen to his body and brain, because the blood is being shunted away from the liver,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"Those are important and potentially life-threatening complications.\"\nAs of now, Lucas is still at home and \"managing his symptoms,\" Mazeriegos said, but the doctor emphasized the importance of his receiving a timely transplant before further complications occur.\nnext Image 1 of 2\nprev Image 2 of 2\nThe Goellers are now seeking support again, launching the \"Save Lucas\" campaign across social media.\nAnd the city of Pittsburgh has rallied once more behind the family, with newly donated billboards and media campaigns.\n\"We're trying to not only save Lucas, but also to build organ donation awareness for both deceased and living donors,\" said Goeller.\nULTIMATE FATHER\u2019S DAY GIFT: SON DONATES KIDNEY TO SAVE HIS DAD\u2019S LIFE\n\"We want it to really sink into hearts around the world because it's so important.\"\nDespite his challenges, young Lucas Goeller remains positive, active and upbeat, continuing to enjoy his love of the outdoors and hunting with his father and his three brothers, aged 12, 8, and 4.\n\"He's always filled with so much joy,\" his mother said. \"We get our strength from him. He encourages all of us to continue to look at the positives in life.\"\nThe ideal living donor for Lucas is someone with type O blood, aged 20 to 49, with a BMI below 30.\nChallenges facing pediatric transplants\nBeyond seeking a liver for their son, the Goellers are looking to raise awareness about the critical need for donors to help the more than 100,000 individuals on the organ donor list.\nChildren on transplant lists in the U.S. face three key challenges, Mazariegos said.\nTINA TURNER SUFFERED FROM KIDNEY DISEASE BEFORE HER DEATH: 'I HAVE PUT MYSELF IN GREAT DANGER'\n\"First, there is a great demand for life-saving transplants, and there are 10 times the number of adults on the liver transplant list as there are children,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"This creates a challenge to allocate the right or the best organ for the children who are waiting on the list.\"\nWhile Mazariegos noted that the allocation policy is slowly improving, it's still imperfect and doesn't always prioritize children appropriately.\nEach year, dozens of children in the U.S. die while awaiting a new liver.\nMazariegos is determined to eliminate this \"wait list mortality\" through the use of partial liver transplants. That's when either a living or deceased donor\u2019s liver is donated to two different recipients.\n\"Saving lives is not about competition \u2014 it\u2019s about collaboration.\"\nAnother challenge is that not all the centers in the country have the capacity to perform highly complex transplants like the one Lucas needs.\n\"We need to train centers across the country on the techniques that will allow them to transplant these children,\" Mazariegos said.\nBoth the Goeller family and the UPMC doctors stressed the importance of raising organ donor awareness so that more families register as organ donors.\nMazariegos noted that people need to be made aware of living donation, which is when donors give part of their liver to a recipient.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nIn 2018, UPMC started a learning network, the Starzl Network for Excellence in Pediatric Transplantation, in honor of Dr. Thomas Starzl, who is recognized as the father of transplantation.\n\"This is an effort to level the playing field and extend the expertise to centers that want to provide the same level of care their patients deserve.\"\nIn Pennsylvania alone , 18 children are waiting for liver transplants, while 300 children are on the list nationwide, Goeller pointed out.\n\"Life-saving donation is only possible through somebody else's love,\" she said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShe said she hopes \"this campaign will inspire others to keep the conversation going and keep talking about Lucas and about other children and adults who need transplants.\"\nShe added, \"Saving lives is not about competition \u2014 it\u2019s about collaboration. It\u2019s going to take more than a village to get this message across the entire world.\"\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-12-09 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":594}
{"title":"The best Prime Day deals on headphones for October 2023","context":"## The best Prime Day deals on headphones for October 2023\n\nEngadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nWe're into day two of Amazon's latest storewide sale for Amazon Prime members, Prime Big Deal Days, and there are still plenty of hefty discounts on headphones, earbuds and gaming headsets we recommend. We\u2019ve sorted through the best headphone deals of the October Prime Day event below, which include new lows on the AirPods Pro, Sony WF-1000XM5, Beats Studio Pro, Amazon Echo Buds and more. Just note that some, but not all, of the offers are only accessible if you subscribe to Prime.\nSony Prime Day headphone deals\nSony WH-1000XM4\nSony WH-1000XM4 $248 $348 Save $100 See at Amazon\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4 is back down to $248, which is $20 more than its all-time low but roughly $80 below its average street price. This is Sony\u2019s last-gen pair of wireless noise-cancelers, but it still delivers powerful ANC, 30-ish hours of battery life and a similarly rich feature set as the newer WH-1000XM5 (which isn't on sale as of this writing). Unlike its successor, it can also fold up for easier storage. It doesn\u2019t have the XM5\u2019s adaptive ANC system, however, and its mic quality isn\u2019t as clear. It\u2019s slightly heavier too, plus it sounds a bit boomier out of the box. But for less than $250, it remains a great value. We gave the XM4 a review score of 94 back in 2020.\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony WF-1000XM5 $278 $300 Save $22 See at Amazon\nThe in-ear Sony WF-1000XM5, meanwhile, are on sale for $278. That\u2019s only $20 off, but it marks the first discount we\u2019ve seen for the top pick in our wireless earbuds buying guide. We gave this true wireless pair a score of 87 earlier this year: Like Sony\u2019s over-ear models, it comes with a range of useful features, powerful noise cancellation and a warm yet detailed default sound. The design here is also much more agreeable than previous Sony earphones.\nSony LinkBuds S\nSony LinkBuds S $128 $200 Save $72 See at Amazon\nThe Sony LinkBuds S are on sale for $128, which is a price we\u2019ve seen in the past but still takes about $30 off the pair\u2019s average street price. We highlight the LinkBuds S as an honorable mention in our wireless earbuds guide, as we like its compact design, decent noise cancellation, handy bonus features and warm sound. It can\u2019t match the ANC strength or battery life of the WF-1000XM5, but it also costs a fair bit less, which helps.\nApple Prime Day headphone deals\nAirPods Pro\nApple AirPods Pro (USB-C) $189 $239 Save $50 See at Amazon\nThe USB-C version of Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro is down to $189, which is $60 off Apple\u2019s list price and a new low. The Lightning version is available for the same price. This is the \u201cbest for iOS\u201d pick in our buying guide. Both models still deliver strong ANC, a superb transparency mode and a pleasingly warm sound. They also come with a variety of Apple-specific features, including hands-free Siri access, Find My tracking and fast pairing with other Apple devices. A recent update added an \u201cAdaptive Audio\u201d mode that dynamically blends its ANC and transparency modes based on your surroundings, while the new USB-C model comes with improved dust resistance alongside the new charging port. That said, you really need to be committed to the Apple ecosystem to get the most out of this, and the six-hour battery life is just OK. We gave the AirPods Pro a score of 88 last year.\nApple AirPods (2nd Gen)\nApple AirPods (2nd Gen) $89 $129 Save $40 See at Amazon\nApple\u2019s second-gen AirPods, meanwhile, are back down to $89. That\u2019s $10 off their usual street price. We can\u2019t broadly recommend the base AirPods to most people these days, as their one-size-fits-all design won\u2019t work for everyone and there are better-sounding options for the money. However, if you\u2019re all-in on Apple devices and just want the usual AirPods perks in an unsealed design, this deal makes the pair a little more palatable.\nBeats Prime Day headphone deals\nBeats Studio Pro\nBeats Studio Pro $180 $350 Save $170 See at Amazon\nThe Beats Studio Pro is on sale for $180, which is a new low and a sizable $170 discount. We gave these wireless over-ears a review score of 81 in July: We can\u2019t recommend them over the top picks in our guide, but they offer a pleasant, even-handed sound, helpful ANC and the ability to stream higher-quality audio over a USB-C connection. Like most Beats headphones, they also play nice with Android. That said, multi-device pairing doesn\u2019t work with iOS, there\u2019s no wear detection and the mostly plastic design isn\u2019t super premium. But at this price, the Studio Pro could make sense if you really dig the Beats aesthetic.\nBeats Fit Pro\nBeats Fit Pro $160 $200 Save $40 See at Amazon\nThe Beats Fit Pro is down to $160, which is a price we\u2019ve seen multiple times in recent months but still takes $40 off the pair\u2019s MSRP. The Fit Pro is the \u201cbest for workouts\u201d pick in our wireless earbuds guide, as it offers most of the Apple-friendly perks you\u2019d get from a set of AirPods \u2014 Beats is a subsidiary of Apple \u2014 in a sportier, more stable design. Its punchy yet refined sound is a plus, and it uses physical control buttons instead of touch panels. However, it lacks multi-device pairing and wireless charging, and its ANC is a step down from the AirPods Pro. We gave the Fit Pro a review score of 87 in 2021.\nAnker Prime Day headphone deals\nSoundcore Space A40\nAnker Soundcore Space A40 $54 $100 Save $46 See at Amazon\nThe Anker Soundcore Space A40 is on sale for $54, which matches its all-time low and comes in $25 less than usual. The Space A40 is the top pick in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds, as it includes a host of features that belie its price: adaptive ANC, multi-device pairing, wireless charging, a transparency mode and up to 10 hours of battery life. Its audio quality and ANC aren\u2019t quite as powerful as more expensive pairs, but both are more than effective enough for the money. Unlike many budget wireless headphones, its default sound doesn\u2019t completely blow out the bass. Just note that its call quality is mediocre, and it lacks wear detection, so it won\u2019t auto-pause when you remove an earbud.\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC $80 $100 Save $20 See at Amazon\nThe Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC carry most of the same benefits as the Space A40 but use a \u201cstem\u201d design reminiscent of Apple\u2019s AirPods. They put a little more emphasis on the bass by default, but you can change that sound profile up with a few EQ tools in Anker\u2019s app. They also support wear detection. If you prefer this sort of form factor, the Liberty 4 NC is down to $80, which is a $20 discount and matches its lowest price to date.\nAnker Soundcore Space Q45\nAnker Soundcore Space Q45 $100 $150 Save $50 See at Amazon\nThe Anker Soundcore Space Q45 is on sale for $100, which is a $50 discount and an all-time low. While not as nice as most of the pricier models in this roundup, the Space Q45 is a fine value if you can\u2019t spend more than $100. Its adaptive ANC is better-than-average and can be set to a manual mode if needed, it supports multi-device pairing and its design is comfortable to wear for hours at a time. Sound quality is where the price is most evident, as it\u2019s a little too uneven in the treble, but its bass-heavy profile should work for fans of hip-hop and EDM. You can tweak the sound somewhat through the EQ tools in Anker\u2019s Soundcore app.\nAnker Soundcore Life Q30\nAnker Soundcore Life Q30 $56 $80 Save $24 See at Amazon\nIf you want a decent set of noise-canceling over-ears for as little as possible, the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 is also worth considering. It\u2019s now down to $56, which is $24 less than usual. This pair isn\u2019t built as well as the Space Q45, nor does it sound as nice out of the box, as it massively inflates the bass and degrades when ANC is active. Call quality is worse too. That said, it\u2019s comfortable, its battery can last more than 40 hours and the ANC itself is excellent for less than $60. You still get multi-device pairing and a customizable EQ as well.\nBose Prime Day headphone deals\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds II\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds II $199 $279 Save $80 See at Amazon\nThe Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II are available for $199, which is an all-time low and roughly $75 off their average street price. This pair has technically been replaced by Bose\u2019s new QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, which add a new spatial audio mode. That model isn\u2019t discounted as of this writing, however, and the two pairs are largely similar otherwise. The QC II\u2019s chief selling point is its ANC performance, which is still among the most powerful on the market. If that\u2019s your chief concern, saving $99 to buy the older pair may still make sense. Just note that it lacks multi-device pairing and wireless charging, and that its earpieces are on the bulky side. We gave the QC IIs a review score of 87 last year.\nBose QuietComfort 45\nBose QuietComfort 45 $229 $329 Save $100 See at Amazon\nAlong those lines, the Bose QuietComfort 45 are down to $229. That\u2019s $30 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked for these over-ears but still $80 below their average street price as of late. This is another noise-canceling set that Bose recently replaced, but the differences between the QC 45 and the new QuietComfort Headphones appear to be small, so the older model is worth a look when it\u2019s discounted like this. We gave the QC 45 a review score of 86 in 2021, and we still like its lightweight design, upper-tier ANC and easygoing sound. You can\u2019t manually adjust the intensity of the ANC, unlike the newer model, and Sony\u2019s XM5 and XM4 provide longer battery life and a more versatile feature set for those willing to pay up. But if that\u2019s not you, the QC 45 is a fine alternative at this price.\nSennheiser Prime Day headphone deals\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 $142 $280 Save $138 See at Amazon\nThe Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 is available for $142, which is a new low. This pair has normally retailed around $180 in recent months. This is the runner-up pick in our wireless earbuds guide, as Engadget\u2019s resident audio expert Billy Steele considers it the best-sounding true wireless pair he\u2019s tested. That warm yet customizable sound is joined by a solid adaptive ANC system, though Sennheiser\u2019s pair isn\u2019t as effective as the Sony WF-1000XM5 in that regard, nor does it have the same deep feature set.\nSennheiser HD560S\nSennheiser HD 560S $150 $229 Save $79 See at Amazon\nWe\u2019re mostly sticking to wireless headphones here since that\u2019s just the way the market has moved, but if you want a quality wired model, the Sennheiser HD 560S is worth a look at $150. While not an all-time low, that\u2019s about $35 below the pair\u2019s typical street price. We recommend the HD 560S in our guide to the best gaming headphones. Its open-back design lets in and leaks a ton of noise, but it sounds spacious, detailed and well-balanced, which makes it a treat for critical listening. It\u2019s comfortable to wear for extended periods as well. Just don\u2019t expect much in the way of deep sub-bass response.\nOther Prime Day wireless headphone deals\nAmazon Echo Buds (2023)\nAmazon Echo Buds (2023) $35 $50 Save $15 See at Amazon\nPrime members can get the latest Amazon Echo Buds for $35, which is $15 off and an all-time low. This is another pick in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. Specifically, the Echo Buds should appeal to those who prefer a more open design, one that lets in outside noise but doesn\u2019t insert directly into your ear canal. They can sound solid for the price with a bit of EQ tweaking, and they support features we don\u2019t often see for less than $50, such as wear detection and multipoint connectivity. They also have Alexa baked in, natch. Their IPX2 sweat-resistance rating isn\u2019t enough for workouts, and their five-ish hours of battery life is just average, but they\u2019re worth a look if you\u2019re on a tight budget and hate the feel of traditional in-ear headphones. We gave them a score of 77 earlier this year.\nShokz OpenRun Pro\nShokz OpenRun Pro $125 $180 Save $55 See at Amazon\nThe Shokz OpenRun Pro is down to $125 for Prime Big Deal Days, which is $25 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked but still $55 below its usual going rate. This is a recommended pair of bone conduction headphones, which means it hugs the side of your head and delivers sound by passing vibrations through your skull. (It\u2019s not as uncomfortable as it sounds.) The main benefit is that this leaves your ear canals completely open, so you can enjoy a playlist or podcast without being shut out from the outside world. The downside, usually, is that you don\u2019t get as full a sound as you would with a traditional pair. That\u2019ll still be the case here, but we\u2019ve found the OpenRun Pro to deliver more low-end depth than most of its peers. They\u2019re fairly comfy and get up to 10 hours of battery life beyond that.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro $120 $200 Save $80 See at Amazon\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro are on sale for $120, which is a new low and $80 off Google\u2019s list price. This is the \u201cbest for Android\u201d recommendation in our wireless earbuds guide, and it earned a review score of 87 last year. Its ANC and V-shaped sound profile aren\u2019t as superlative as our top picks, but they\u2019re fine, and the whole package integrates tightly with Google\u2019s line of Pixel phones. An upcoming firmware update promises improved call quality \u2014 one of our review\u2019s chief complaints \u2014 and the ability to automatically pause music when you\u2019re speaking, similar to what pairs from Sony and Apple offer. Those with smaller ear canals may find the fit to be tricky, though we had few issues with comfort in testing.\nJLab Go Air Pop\nJLab Go Air Pop $16 $25 Save $8 See at Amazon\nThe JLab Go Air Pop is down to $16.44 for Prime Big Deal Days, which is about $6 less than usual. We highlight this set in our budget wireless earbuds guide, as it gets you a compact shape, IPX4-rated water resistance, eight or so hours of battery life and a full set of functional touch controls for dirt cheap. Its boomy sound isn\u2019t exactly great, but it\u2019s serviceable, which is a victory when we\u2019re talking about $16 wireless earbuds. Plus, while it lacks a companion app, JLab bakes three EQ presets into the earbuds themselves.\nPrime Day gaming headset deals\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2 $35 $50 Save $15 See at Amazon\nThe top budget pick in our gaming headphones buying guide, the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2, is on sale for $35. That\u2019s just a modest $5 discount but matches the lowest price we\u2019ve seen. The Cloud Stinger 2 doesn\u2019t have the most balanced or detailed sound, but its V-shaped signature gives action scenes a nice level of impact, and its mic quality belies the dirt-cheap price. The design is comfortable too, though it\u2019s made from cheap-feeling plastic.\nHyperX Cloud Alpha\nHyperX Cloud Alpha $60 $100 Save $40 See at Amazon\nIf you\u2019re willing to pay a little more, the HyperX Cloud Alpha is another decent value at $60, which is $15 or so lower than its typical street price. We note this as an honorable mention in our guide: It\u2019s been around for a few years now, but it\u2019s comfortable, and its detachable mic is solid. It\u2019s better built than the Cloud Stinger 2 as well. At this price, they don\u2019t sound bad either, though an underemphasized treble means they aren\u2019t especially detailed.\nLogitech G535\nLogitech G535 $80 $130 Save $50 See at Amazon\nIf you\u2019re looking for a wireless headset, the Logitech G535 is back down to $80, which is about $25 below its average street price. This is an honorable mention in our gaming headsets guide, as we like its lightweight design, Bluetooth support and agreeable, relatively well-balanced sound. It forces you to crank the volume to reach a listenable level though, and its mic makes voices sound a little too thin. It also doesn't work with Xbox consoles. But if you really want a wireless gaming headset for less than $100, it\u2019s well worth a look.\nYour October Prime Day Shopping Guide: See all of our Prime Day coverage.

No friends. She won\u2019t even know if it\u2019s day or night. There\u2019s no light down there.

No party. No friends. She won\u2019t even know if it\u2019s day or night.\"\nBillboards with images of Israelis held hostage in Gaza will also appear in 1,500 other locations in 48 cities across the United States.\nIt\u2019s part of an effort to remind Americans that some 240 Israeli civilians, including children like Emily, were snatched from concerts, from their homes and even from their beds in a surprise attack by Hamas terrorists against unarmed civilian targets.\nBring Them Home Now, an organic volunteer group that came together in the hours after the attack, heads the international outreach effort.\nEmily, even at 9, is older than many of the hostages. The youngest was just 9 months old when snatched away as a trophy of terror.\nThomas Hand\u2019s suffering over the past 40 days has made international headlines. He was first told in the days after the terror attack that his little girl was dead.\nCHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE BY TERROR GROUP: \u2018BRING THEM HOME NOW\u2019 SAYS IT WON'T REST UNTIL ALL ARE RETURNED SAFELY\nHe said in one interview that he welcomed her death because it was better than her being held captive and tortured by Hamas.\nHe found out later that his daughter had been taken hostage by Hamas.\nEmily, \"just loved life and music,\" her father said. \"Beyonc\u00e9 is a favorite because Beyonc\u00e9 is a beautiful singer and a very good dancer. And so Emily would copy her.\"\n\"She had this gift that she could memorize movements, she could just memorize whole routines, and she would do it within a very short time.\"\nHer natural dancing talent was apparent to everyone in Be\u2019eri, not far from the border of Gaza.\n\"Every holiday they'd have performances of little kids and older kids, so she was always in it. But she was always there front and center because she would always remember the moves if the kids at the back didn't.\"\n\"Beyonc\u00e9 in particular is a favorite because Beyonc\u00e9 is a beautiful singer and a very good dancer \u2026 Emily would copy her.\"\nHand shared stories of his beautiful girl and the ugly circumstances of her abduction in an interview at Central Synagogue in Midtown Manhattan.\nHand himself is not Jewish.\nHe was born in Dublin, Ireland, and raised Roman Catholic before moving in 1992 to Israel \u2014 a nation he called a multicultural \"paradise\" up until Oct. 7.\nHe last saw Emily the night of Oct. 6 at dinner in the communal dining room of the kibbutz.\nShe asked after dinner if she could sleep over her friend\u2019s house.\nHe agreed and kissed her goodbye.\nISRAELI MOM RECOUNTS LAST CALL FROM TERRIFIED DAUGHTER AS \u2018BRING THEM HOME NOW\u2019 VOWS FIND HAMAS HOSTAGES\nInitial reports that Emily had been killed were later refuted by official accounts.\n\"We had an eyewitness seeing her being led away by the terrorists with her friend where she was doing a sleepover and the mother of that friend. So it's absolutely confirmed that she was taken away by the terrorists and is in the tunnels of Gaza now.\"\nEmily and the others in the family she was staying with hid, like many of the hostages taken from homes, in the household bomb shelters common in Israel. They're designed to protect Israeli citizens from frequent missile attacks.\nOfficials told Hand \"in all probability she's in Gaza because there was no blood in the bomb shelter and there was no blood in the house that matched Emily's DNA,\" he said.\nLife has been almost unbearable for him since that day.\nHand was described as \"fragile\" by one person working with family members of the Israeli hostages.\nHand spoke to Fox News Digital beside Michael Levy, whose brother Or was also taken hostage by terrorists.\nHand said he's lost about 18 pounds since his little girl was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\nThey were accompanied by Israeli mental health expert Dr. Ofrit Shapira-Berman.\n\"I'm Irish, so I have a couple of beers before I go to bed and that sets me off because I don't want to think,\" the father said. \"I wouldn't be able to sleep. I'm eating very little.

I always wanted an American hot dog, and I was full after that.\"\nHe's lost interest in news amid his own pain and the ongoing pain of the entire nation of Israel.\n\"I'm a refugee. I have no home to go back to.\"\n\"At first it was a morbid curiosity to maybe see Emily amongst it all. And then it was just too much. I couldn't watch it anymore. I don't watch the news. I don't watch these videos.\"\nHe\u2019s also been homeless since Be\u2019eri was savaged.\n\"I'm a refugee,\" he said. \"I have no home to go back to.\"\nThe community \"lost 112 murdered and so many, many more kidnapped\" among a population of about 1,200.\n\"Your whole community was devastated. Yeah, we\u2019re all refugees,\" he said. \"We\u2019re all living in various hotels all over the country.\"\nYehudit Weiss was one of the residents of Be\u2019eri taken hostage on Oct. 7. Israeli Defense Forces reported on Thursday that they found her body in a building adjacent to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, which Israel says Hamas had been using as a headquarters.\nHand expressed hope that the billboards going on display in Times Square on his daughter\u2019s birthday, and then around the U.S., will remind Americans of the ongoing terror and antisemitism suffered by Israeli families \u2014 and do so in a medium that can't be defaced or removed from public view amid ongoing anti-Israeli hatred.\n\"The great thing about these billboards is that these \u2014 I don\u2019t know what to call these people \u2014 won\u2019t be able to rip down the images,\" Hand said.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\"That\u2019s the one thing I can\u2019t understand.

He shouted out angrily, while the woman moved quickly down the sidewalk. She raised a hand behind her as if to mock the suffering father's pain.\n\"My daughter, she doesn't know if I was killed or kidnapped or somewhere else. She's in terror every day.\"\nFurther pain is still to come, Hand said, if and when the hostages return and find out loved ones have been killed and entire families massacred.\nHe's also haunted by the fear Emily has suffered since Oct. 7 and now here on what should be her joyous birthday celebration embraced by the love of their kibbutz.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"My daughter, she doesn't know if I was killed or kidnapped or somewhere else,\" Hand said.\n\"She's in terror every day.\"\nSydney Borchers and Brittany Kasko of Fox News Digital contributed reporting.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Lifestyle on 2023-11-17 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":596}

The good news: We watch it all so you don\u2019t have to. Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\nComedy can feel like an ignored genre in modern moviemaking.\nHorror\u2019s having a fantastic 2023. Thrillers come out on a weekly basis. Even action movies have had some stellar recent releases. But Hollywood has been in a comedic rut in recent years, with fewer and fewer notable releases from big studios.\nBut fear not, dear reader \u2014 we know how to find some good laughs. We\u2019ve compiled a list of the best comedy movies you can watch at home, scraping streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and HBO Max, as well as free services, to find the best of the best.\nWhether it\u2019s a romantic comedy that makes your heart sing while bringing out a smile or a gut-busting laugh-out-loud comedy, we have a variety of options sure to bring you laughter and brighten up your night.\nHere are our picks for the best comedy movies you can watch at home right now. If you\u2019re only looking for the best comedy movies on Netflix, we\u2019ve got you covered there, too. Our latest update to this list added The Road to El Dorado as an editor\u2019s pick.\nEditor\u2019s pick\nThe Road to El Dorado\nYear: 2000\n\ufeffRun time: 1hr 29m\nDirectors: Eric \u201cBibo\u201d Bergeron, Don Paul, Jeffrey Katzenberg\nCast: Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez\nThe Road to El Dorado came out at the wrong time.\nThe animated buddy comedy came out during the transition point between the Disney Renaissance and the eventual wave of crass CG movies ushered in by Shrek (what I\u2019ve dubbed the Beloved Failures era). But even though it failed spectacularly in theaters, home video turned it into a cult classic and a meme powerhouse. So many frames of the movie have been repurposed as reaction GIFs and meme templates, but while the vivid facial expressions and body movement of the animated characters certainly lends itself to memeable formats, the movie itself is truly hilarious.\nThe setup is already promising: two runaway con men from Spain somehow end up in South America, where the locals of El Dorado believe them to be gods. But the banter between pragmatic Tulio and idealistic Miguel is absolutely amazing, with Kline and Branagh slipping into an easy and comedic repartee (not to mention the shipping potential that comes from their married-couple-like banter). Toss in snarky Chel (Rosie Perez), a local who wants out of the city, and the trio is electric \u2014 and distinctly made up of morally gray lying characters, a rarity in that era of animation where heroes and princesses save the day.\nThe three of them attempt to leave El Dorado with buckets of gold, but first they must play along with the charade, which only gets them into increasingly ridiculous situations. They partake in local festivities, go 2-vs-15 in a sports game, and eventually have to defend El Dorado from Conquistador Hernan Cortez. With each impossible feat, the ragtag trio of schemers pulls it off again and again, heightening their antics and plans \u2014 all with excellent banter (and a banging Elton John soundtrack). \u2014 Petrana Radulovic\nThe Road to El Dorado is available to stream on Netflix.\nBook Club\nYear: 2018\nRun time: 1h 44m\nDirector: Bill Holderman\nCast: Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, Mary Steenburgen\nThis delightful and raunchy romantic comedy stars Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen as a group of best friends who have been a part of a long-standing book club. Each of them, though successful in their careers, are dealing with crises of life or love. When one of them picks Fifty Shades of Grey as the next book they\u2019ll all read together, it opens the group up in a lovely story of personal acceptance and self-realization, no matter what stage of life you find yourself in. \u2014PV\nBook Club is available to stream on Paramount Plus and FuboTV, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.\nCatherine Called Birdy\nYear: 2022\nRun time: 1h 48m\nDirector: Lena Dunham\nCast: Bella Ramsey, Andrew Scott, Billie Piper\nLena Dunham\u2019s adaptation of the beloved children\u2019s novel is an outstanding coming-of-age story that is the rare book-to-movie adaptation done right. It\u2019s a warm story about the difficulties of teenage girlhood and all the expectations that come with it in any era (but especially medieval times), anchored by excellent central performances from Bella Ramsey (Game of Thrones) and Andrew Scott (Fleabag).\nRamsey plays a young girl named Birdy, whose father (Scott) is attempting to arrange a marriage for her in order to save the family\u2019s finances. A strong-willed girl with a penchant for playfulness and mischief, Birdy is intent on disrupting her father\u2019s plans for her. The movie excels through its layered portrayals of Birdy and her father \u2014 neither is pure hero or pure villain, and Dunham complicates the book\u2019s portrayal of the two to much success.\nI put Catherine Called Birdy on one Saturday afternoon, expecting it to be enjoyable background fare while I played some games and did some work around the house. Instead, I was completely enthralled for all 108 minutes. It\u2019s one of the most delightful movies of the year, and I can not recommend it highly enough. \u2014PV\nCatherine Called Birdy is available to stream on Prime Video.\nCharade\nYear: 1963\nRun time: 1h 54m\nDirector: Stanley Donen\nCast: Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau\nThe heist at the center of Charade was successful years prior to the movie, and without realizing it, Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) has been living off the profits from her husband\u2019s crime. When he is suddenly murdered, she realizes she didn\u2019t really know anything about him \u2014 or, for that matter, the new man in her life, Peter Joshua (Cary Grant). To make matters worse, the remaining money is missing, and a lot of terrible people think Reggie knows where it is. As more people are pulled into the orbit of the money, it becomes less clear who, if anyone, Reggie can trust.\nHepburn and Grant, two famously talented and charming stars, are at their most charming and talented in Charade. In the span of a single scene, Hepburn might move from pragmatic to seductive to fearful with believable ease. Grant\u2019s initial discomfort with their age gap \u2014 25 years, a still-not-uncommon chasm in Hollywood \u2014 resulted in rewrites to the script to make clear that Reggie was pursuing him; it remains one of the few movies in which the gap is acknowledged and dealt with believably, rather than taken for granted. Their chemistry is immediate and undeniable; it\u2019s key in carrying off the film\u2019s snappy dialogue and mixture of flirtatious comedy, captivating mystery, and genuine thriller. It\u2019s His Girl Friday by way of Hitchcock. \u2014Jenna Stoeber\nCharade is available to stream on Prime Video, for free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy, or for free with ads on Vudu, The Roku Channel, Freevee, Tubi, and Pluto TV. It is also available for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.\nClueless\nYear: 1995\nRun time: 1h 37m\nDirector: Amy Heckerling\nCast: Alicia Silverstone, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd\nThere have been many adaptations of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma over the years \u2014 and many actresses taking on Jane Austen\u2019s self-proclaimed unlikable heroine. There\u2019s Gwyneth Paltrow in the pastel-swathed 1990s version who makes Emma haughty, yet lovable; Joanna Sotomura in the 2013 webseries Emma Approved turns the socialite into an ambitious, albeit misguided lifestyle guru; and more recently, Anya Taylor-Joy\u2019s rendition of the character gives her a piercing mean streak worthy of the original.\nAll these Emmas have their own merits, but sometimes the most memorable Emma isn\u2019t an Emma at all, but a Cher.\nClueless takes the general framework of Emma \u2014 a rich, bored young woman who just can\u2019t stop getting involved in everyone\u2019s business \u2014 and transports the story from Regency-era England to 1990s Beverly Hills. Emma is now Cher, played wonderfully by Alicia Silverstone, a chic, stylish, and popular high school student who thinks she knows what\u2019s best for everyone.\nThe beats of Jane Austen\u2019s original story still play out. Cher takes an unpopular new student under her wing and tries to set her up with a hot match that\u2019ll catapult her to social fame. All those matches end up being catastrophic failures. Cher goes too far and learns a bit about herself along the way. All of it is done with bright, bold 1990s fashion and slang, with iconic quotable lines and the very best that teen movies have to offer. Come for young Paul Rudd, stay for the sentiment that stories are timeless and that human traits transcend eras (and also Cher\u2019s digital closet). \u2014Petrana Radulovic\nClueless is available to stream on Paramount Plus or for free with ads on Pluto TV.\nComing to America\nYear: 1988\nRun time: 1h 56m\nDirector: John Landis\nCast: Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones\nEddie Murphy stars in the 1988 romantic comedy Coming to America as Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African country of Zamunda who, tired of his mother and father\u2019s meddling in his love life, journeys to the borough of Queens in New York City with his personal aide Semmi (Arsenio Hall) to search for a wife. Directed by John Landis and based on a story by Murphy, Coming to America is packed with endlessly quotable performances by Samuel L. Jackson, James Earl Jones, Louie Anderson, John Amos, and Murphy and Arsenio in multiple roles. The movie is an absolute riot front to back and an enduring classic for good reason: It\u2019s one of Murphy\u2019s finest films. \u2014Toussaint Egan\nComing to America is available to stream on Netflix, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.\nDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart\nYear: 2011\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 55m\nDirector: Johnnie To, Wai Ka-fai\nCast: Louis Koo, Daniel Wu, Gao Yuanyuan\nJohnnie To is one of our great modern directors, equally adept in hard-boiled triad crime dramas and light-hearted romantic comedies alike. 2011\u2019s Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart falls in the latter category, and is one of the many high marks of the Hong Kong director\u2019s legendary career. Fresh off the end of a long-term relationship, Chi-yan (Gao Yuanyuan) is an analyst for an investment bank who finds herself in the middle of a love triangle. On one side, there\u2019s Sean (Louis Koo), a CEO who works across the street from Chi-yan and yearns for her through the tall corporate glass windows that separate them. On the other, there\u2019s Kevin (the always-dreamy Daniel Wu), an alcoholic former architect who helps Chi-Yan move on and is inspired by her to start creating again. What follows is a sincere, funny, and truly charming romantic time. \u2014PV\nDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart is available to stream on Netflix.\nEega\nYear: 2012\nRun time: 2h 14m\nDirector: S.S. Rajamouli\nCast: Sudeepa, Nani, Samantha\nOne of the very best movies on Netflix, the logline for Eega will clue you in right away as to whether this movie is up your alley or not. A whirlwind slapstick comedy revenge thriller from the director of RRR and the Baahubali movies, Eega is about a man who is murdered by a romantic rival and reincarnated as a fly, teaming up with the woman he loves to exact revenge on the man who killed him. It\u2019s joyously fun and absolutely bonkers (complimentary), with exciting action sequences, groundbreaking visual effects, and plenty of laugh-out-loud jokes. Much to its benefit, the fly in Eega is completely silent, instead pushing director Rajamouli to employ some classic tricks from silent cinema for laughs and gasps alike. \u2014PV\nEega is available to stream on Netflix.\nThe Gold Rush\nYear: 1925\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 28m\nDirector: Charlie Chaplin\nCast: Charlie Chaplin, Georgia Hale, Mack Swain\nCharlie Chaplin\u2019s adventurous comedy is nearly 100 years old, and it absolutely still holds up for the modern sense of humor. In The Gold Rush, Chaplin\u2019s \u201cLittle Tramp\u201d is a prospector living on a shack in the middle of the Klondike. Extreme slapstick and farce ensue, as Little Tramp\u2019s blown by Canadian winds, stoops to eating a leather shoe for sustenance, and eventually performs his legendary fork dance. Chaplin \u2014 even more than the muscle icons of the 1980s \u2014 is the key DNA to modern action entertainment, and if you\u2019ve never seen one of his classics, The Gold Rush is a hilarious entry point. \u2014Matt Patches\nThe Gold Rush is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel or for free with ads on Freevee, Tubi, and Plex. It is also available for for digital rental or purchase on Amazon and Apple TV.\nI Married a Witch\nYear: 1942\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 16m\nDirector: Ren\u00e9 Clair\nCast: Fredric March, Veronica Lake, Robert Benchley\nRen\u00e9 Clair, who made his name in early French silent and sound cinema, spent a few years making movies in the U.S. during World War II. Among them is the exemplary black-and-white romantic comedy I Married a Witch, which stars the incomparable Veronica Lake as a witch who hopes to exact revenge on the descendant of the man who imprisoned her by making him fall in love with her.\nWhen two witches \u2014 Jennifer (Lake) and her father, Daniel (Cecil Kellaway) \u2014 are burned at the stake by Puritans in colonial Salem, they curse the man who denounced them. He and his descendants (all played by Fredric March) will be doomed to be unhappy in love, always marrying \u201cthe wrong woman.\u201d Jennifer and Daniel awake 270 years later, and she begins pursuing her target: Wallace Wooley, the latest descendant of the man that caused her execution and also a leading candidate for governor. Oh, and his wedding to the daughter of his top political supporter is tomorrow.\nWith costumes by the legendary Edith Head, charming practical effects (the two witches are represented by wisps of smoke before inhabiting bodies), and plenty of hilarious gags (there\u2019s a \u201cpopped maize\u201d vendor during the \u201cintermission\u201d of the witches\u2019 execution), I Married a Witch is a breezy 77 minutes of Classic Hollywood delight. \u2014PV\nI Married a Witch is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon and Apple TV.\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang\nYear: 2005\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 42m\nDirector: Shane Black\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang is, without a doubt, one of if not the funniest and most effortlessly cool movies I have ever seen. Partially based on Brett Halliday\u2019s 1941 novel Bodies Are Where You Find Them, Shane Black\u2019s neo-noir black comedy crime thriller stars Robert Downey Jr. as Harry Lockhart, a petty thief who, due to a series of extraordinary circumstances, is mistaken for an actor and whisked away from the back alleys of New York to the twinkling lights of Los Angeles for a screen test. While there, Harry inadvertently finds himself ensnared in a murder mystery involving his childhood crush (Michelle Monaghan), a sarcastic private detective (Val Kilmer), and a retired actor named (Corbin Bernsen) with a terrible secret to hide.\nRelentlessly meta, wickedly funny, and boasting one of the coolest opening title sequences of its time, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is the rough-and-tumble blueprint to Black\u2019s 2016 movie The Nice Guys, and by all degrees the better film of the two. \u2014TE\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang is available for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\nYear: 2004\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 58m\nDirector: Wes Anderson\nCast: Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett\nWes Anderson\u2019s eccentric 2004 ensemble comedy is dedicated to Jacques Cousteau and is a loving (and hilarious) homage to the legendary French oceanographer. Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is an oceanographer\/documentarian who loses his best friend to a shark attack while working on his project. Zissou sets out for his next project: to find and kill the shark, and film the whole thing.\nThe hilarious ensemble cast includes Anjelica Huston (Zissou\u2019s estranged wife who finances his projects), Willem Dafoe (an emotionally insecure German first mate), Owen Wilson (a Zissou super-fan who believes he is Zissou\u2019s son), and Jeff Goldblum (playing Zissou\u2019s rival, a more successful oceanographer). With an excellent soundtrack of Portuguese David Bowie covers by Brazilian singer-songwriter Seu Jorge and Anderson\u2019s typical attention to detail in composition, The Life Aquatic is a cinematic feast of the senses. \u2014PV\nThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is for free with a library card on Hoopla, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nLittle Monsters\nYear: 2019\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 34m\nDirector: Abe Forsythe\nCast: Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Alexander England, Josh Gad\nDirector Abe Forsythe\u2019s 2019 horror comedy Little Monsters stars Alexander England (Alien: Covenant) as Dave, a foul-mouthed and down-on-his-luck rock musician living with his sister and nephew after a rough breakup. Attempting to get on the good side of Miss Caroline (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), his nephew\u2019s kindergarten teacher, Dave agrees to come along and chaperone the class\u2019 field trip to a petting zoo. Unfortunately for them, the petting zoo sits right next to a U.S. Army base that happens to be experiencing a zombie outbreak. As the class finds itself cornered by the undead horde, Dave will have to help Miss Caroline to make sure everyone gets out alive. Can he win her heart, or at the very least grow as a person for the experience? We won\u2019t spoil it, but we will tell you Josh Gad gets attacked by zombies in the process. \u2014TE\nLittle Monsters is available to stream on Hulu.\nLove & Friendship\nYear: 2016\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 30m\nDirector: Whit Stillman\nCast: Kate Beckinsale, Xavier Samuel, Emma Greenwell\nWhit Stillman\u2019s uproarious adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Lady Susan stars Kate Beckinsale in one of her richest (and most hilarious) roles. Beckinsale plays Lady Susan, a young widow looking to secure appropriate matches for both her daughter (Morfydd Clark) and herself. Susan flirts and schemes her way throughout the movie to the delight of the audience and the frustration of her suitors and friends.\nLove & Friendship features terrific supporting turns by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny (as Susan\u2019s supportive best friend), Tom Bennett (playing a hilariously dense wealthy fool), and the rest of the cast, as well as Stillman\u2019s characteristic biting dialogue and an attention to detail in sets and costuming. But the whole thing is brought together by Beckinsale\u2019s transcendent performance, one of the more recent examples of how comedic roles get ignored during awards season. \u2014PV\nLove & Friendship is available to stream on Prime Video.\nMagic Mike and Magic Mike XXL\nYear: 2012 (Magic Mike); 2015 (Magic Mike XXL)\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 50m (Magic Mike); 1h 55m (Magic Mike XXL)\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh (Magic Mike); Gregory Jacobs (Magic Mike XXL)\nCast: Channing Tatum, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello\nTwo joyous celebrations of bodies in motion contained within working class stories of trying to Make It Work in the face of a grueling world? Pure excellence. Channing Tatum, Joe Manganiello, and the rest of the ensemble cast soar, and both movies contain unforgettable set-pieces sure to get you off your feet.\nSteven Soderbergh\u2019s Magic Mike is an excellent subversive rom-com, inverting many standard gender tropes in the genre. The follow-up, Magic Mike XXL, is even more rapturously joyous than the first, celebrating pleasure in its many forms (in this way, you could say it is like Hellraiser without the pain). XXL also doubles as a road trip movie and a \u201cthe crew gets back together for one last job\u201d movie. Also: Manganiello goes all out in a minimart dancing to \u201cI Want It That Way.\u201d Perfection, no notes. \u2014PV\nMagic Mike and Magic Mike XXL are available to stream for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nMoonstruck\nYear: 1987\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 41m\nDirector: Norman Jewison\nCast: Cher, Nicolas Cage, Vincent Gardenia\nThe joy is in the smaller moments in Moonstruck. A mother cooks an egg-in-a-hole for her daughter. An older couple trades barbs with each other before the conversation shifts on a dime to expressions of eternal love. An elderly man basks in the moonlight with his five adorable dogs.\nA widow (Cher) is convinced her ill-fated first marriage was doomed by bad luck after a hasty engagement and wedding. When a suitor (Danny Aiello) proposes, she accepts, but ends up falling for his estranged brother (Nicolas Cage) instead.\nWith warm sets that feel lived-in, loving depictions of food (the egg-in-a-hole has since been colloquially dubbed \u201cMoonstruck Eggs\u201d) and romance, hilarious family conversations (\u201cOld man, you give another plate of my food to those dogs, I\u2019m going to kick you till you\u2019re dead!\u201d), and complementary lead performances by an assured Cher and an intense Cage, Moonstruck is a touching, uproarious romantic comedy about superstition, love, and family. \u2014PV\nMoonstruck is available to stream for free with ads on Pluto TV, Tubi, and The Roku Channel, with a library card on Hoopla, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nMultiple Maniacs\nYear: 1970\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 31m\nDirector: John Waters\nCast: Divine, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce\nThe early transgressive comedies of John Waters have been anointed by Criterion as art, and one can only imagine what Waters circa 1970 would make of that. Multiple Maniacs, the provocateur\u2019s second film, is just batshit nutso, constructing a flimsy scenario in which Lady Divine (Waters\u2019 go-to collaborator) spirals out of control on a murder spree and her ex-lover (David Lochary) plots to kill her first with other members of Waters\u2019 Dreamlander acting troupe. In true Waters fashion, the plot is an excuse for bodily fluid expulsion, flamboyant performance, and a moment of backdoor penetration courtesy of a sacred religious object. Today, with scrutiny from every side of the ideological spectrum, it would be almost impossible to do what Waters pulled off back in the \u201970s. Criterion knew what it was doing preserving these jaw-dropping memories. \u2014MP\nMultiple Maniacs is available to stream on HBO Max and Criterion Channel, for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon and Google Play.\nThe Paper Tigers\nYear: 2020\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 48m\nDirector: Bao Tran (Tran Quoc Bao)\nCast: Alain Uy, Ron Yuan, Mykel Shannon Jenkins\nTran Quoc Bao\u2019s kung fu action comedy stars Alain Uy, Ron Yuan (Mulan), and Mykel Shannon Jenkins as the eponymous Paper Tigers: three former martial arts prodigies who, after a lifetime of strenuous training and hard fighting, have grown into beleaguered middle-aged nobodies. But when their master is murdered, the three swear an oath to avenge his memory and bring his killer to justice.

Plus One, from Pen15 writers Jeff Chan and Andrew Rhymer, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival before quietly settling into a place on streaming and has been largely overlooked. Don\u2019t miss it: Maya Erskine (Pen15) and Jack Quaid (The Boys) star as best buds who\u2019ve seen all of their friends get hitched and have become go-to plus ones for the endless marathon of nuptials. Formula works to the movie\u2019s advantage, finding sweet humor in modern situations and wringing Erskine and Quaid for every drip of charisma they have to offer. A gem that could easily been mistaken as product in our current era of rom-coms. \u2014MP\nPlus One is available to stream for free with a library card on Hoopla, for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nSingin\u2019 in the Rain\nYear: 1952\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 42m\nDirectors: Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen\nCast: Gene Kelly, Donald O\u2019Connor, Debbie Reynolds\nWhat is there to say about one of the most well-loved movies of all time? I\u2019ll tell you this: If Singin\u2019 in the Rain wasn\u2019t on this list, we wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs right.\nStanley Donen and Gene Kelly\u2019s timeless 1952 classic is as joyous and funny as you remember \u2014 Donald O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cMake \u2019Em Laugh\u201d bit will leave you in stitches \u2014 but it\u2019s probably a bit stranger, too. In addition to all the industry jokes and the contemplation on the addition of sound to movies, the 13-minute dream sequence \u201cBroadway Melody\u201d is absolutely hypnotizing. \u2014PV\nSingin\u2019 in the Rain is available to stream on Max, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nSpy\nYear: 2015\n\ufeffRun time: 2h\nDirector: Paul Feig\nCast: Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham\nAs the biggest blockbusters in the world have become more and more comedy-oriented, there\u2019s been less space for true comedies in theaters. Spy is the rare exception, and it\u2019s finally more broadly available to watch at home after its addition to the Max catalog.\nA sendup of espionage movies from director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Freaks and Geeks), it stars a pitch-perfect Melissa McCarthy as a desk worker for the CIA who is forced into active duty when her partner (Jude Law) is killed by the daughter of an arms dealer (Rose Byrne, who is positively delightful in this). Add in scene-stealing turns from Jason Statham as an overconfident Bond parody, Allison Janney as McCarthy\u2019s skeptical boss, and appearances by Bobby Cannavale, Peter Serafinowicz, and Miranda Hart, and you\u2019ve got a rollicking good time (with terrific action shot by Day Shift director J.J.

Hall\u2019s Lisa is a protective force in the lives of her girls, able to put on a brave face in front of them (and in support of them) even when the circumstances around them seem on the verge of a total spiral. Haley Lu Richardson (as the peppy Maci) and Shayna \u201cJunglepussy\u201d McHayle (as the no-nonsense Danyelle) stand out among the movie\u2019s many great supporting turns.\nFunny, heartwarming, and undeniably tangible in its ground-level depiction of a hectic workplace, Support the Girls is a movie about looking out for each other in a trying world. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \u2014PV\nSupport the Girls is available to stream on Prime Video, Hulu, The Criterion Channel, for free with a library card on Kanopy or Hoopla, for free with ads on The Roku Channel, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nTampopo\nYear: 1985\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 54m\nDirector: Juzo Itami\nCast: Tsutomu Yamazaki, Nobuko Miyamoto, K\u014dji Yakusho\nThis 1985 \u201cramen western\u201d is a hilarious romp that also happens to be one of the most gorgeous depictions of food ever put on screen. When a pair of truck drivers stop at a run-down ramen shop, they befriend the widowed owner and help her turn the restaurant's fortunes around. A lovely story of community, passion, and human nature all filtered through the appreciation of good food, Tampopo is a cinematic feast. \u2014PV\nTampopo is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.\nTo Be or Not to Be\nYear: 1942\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 39m\nDirector: Ernst Lubitsch\nCast: Carole Lombard, Jack Benny, Robert Stack\nErnst Lubitsch\u2019s 1942 masterpiece is an uproarious and touching anti-war story about a group of actors who use their theatrical skills to dupe a group of Nazi soldiers in occupied Warsaw. Superstar acting couple Joseph (Jack Benny) and Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) run a theater planning to put on a performance of \u201cGestapo,\u201d a comedic play satirizing Hitler. But when Germany invades and a Nazi spy schemes to give a list of secret identities of Resistance fighters to the Nazis, the troupe uses every theater trick in the book to outmaneuver the Nazis (including a visiting Hitler himself) and do their part in the war effort.\nWith hilarious repeated gags, disguises galore, and a rock-solid emotional foundation of a group of people trying to look out for each other in the face of evil, To Be or Not to Be is a high mark in the history of American cinema and one of my personal favorite movies ever made. \u2014PV\nTo Be or Not to Be is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel.\nThe Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience\nYear: 2019\n\ufeffRun time: 30m\nDirector: Mike Diva, Akiva Schaffer\nCast: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer\nThe Lonely Island dropped this musical movie \u2014 a spoof of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade focused on Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire\u2019s notorious 1980s home run streak \u2014 out of nowhere in 2019. It deserves more love.\nIn line with their previous efforts, like Tour de Pharmacy and 7 Days in Hell (co-starring Kit Harington!), The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience explores the shared psyche of Canseco and McGwire through poetry, abstract imagery, and profane lyrics. Alana Haim, Maya Rudolph, Hannah Simone, Jenny Slate, Jim O\u2019Heir, and Sterling K. Brown \u2014 as Sia \u2014 all appear. Surprisingly, Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer don\u2019t skimp on the darkness of the Bash Brothers. With lyrics like \u201cStab that needle in my ass until I am rich \/ Make me a god with the chemical sciences,\u201d the Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience eventually finds McGwire begging a vision of his father to save his life as Canseco raps about how therapy is for the weak. \u2014MP\nThe Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience is available to stream on Netflix.\nWheels on Meals\nYear: 1984\n\ufeffRun time: 1h 38m\nDirector: Sammo Hung\nCast: Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao\nFew creative teams have ever managed the consistent level of excellence that Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao did with their Hong Kong martial arts action comedies in the 1980s, and Wheels on Meals is one of the best of an outrageously good group of movies (and my personal favorite). Set and shot in Barcelona, the movie centers on Thomas (Chan) and David (Yuen), a pair of cousins who run a food truck (with skateboarding tricks to boot) and find themselves enamored with a local woman (Lola Forner). When they run into a somewhat incompetent private investigator (Sammo Hung) who is also looking for the woman, the group bands together to save her when she is suddenly kidnapped.\nWheels on Meals features some of the very best fight scenes of Jackie Chan\u2019s prolific filmography, as he squares off against legendary kickboxer Benny Urquidez (the two would later fight again in Dragons Forever), who at the time was among the most prominent and successful fighters in the world. The whole movie is worth your time, but if you want to just find their six-minute marathon fight session on YouTube, there are few things better in this world.\nIf you like this, you should also check out Project A, which came out a year before and features one of the most daring and jaw-dropping stunts of Chan\u2019s illustrious career. \u2014PV\nWheels on Meals is available to stream for free with ads on Plex and FreeVee, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon.\n\nThis article, authored by Toussaint Egan, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-16 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":597}
{"title":"Palestine\u2019s growing tech industry has been literally blown apart by Israel\u2019s war on Hamas","context":"## Palestine\u2019s growing tech industry has been literally blown apart by Israel\u2019s war on Hamas\n\nPalestine\u2019s growing tech industry has been literally blown apart by the war between Israel and Hamas\nGaza, despite being one of the most economically challenged regions in the world, has ironically always been a tech hub \u2014 not only for Palestine and Palestinians, but also for the world: International companies have, for many years, sought out a presence there to collaborate with talented tech freelancers and the startups that gradually emerged from the region. For example, according to sources who helped build those bridges, Nvidia, famed for its role in the new AI boom, has been working with at least 100 engineers from the region for years. (Tragically, the initiative to employ Palestinians in this outsourcing was that of Mellanox founder Eyal Waldman, whose daughter was brutally murdered in the attacks by Hamas).\nSince at least 2008, TechCrunch been covering technology companies out of Palestine, some serving their direct audience, some serving the tech world internationally. Silicon Valley had taken an increasing interest in Palestine as a tech hub, but like the ecosystem itself, it\u2019s nascent: To date, those working in the region estimate that as much as $10 million has been invested in the Palestinian tech ecosystem.\nNotably, in 2017, Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff joined Silicon Valley luminaries in backing the first-ever coding academy to be created in Gaza.\nGaza Sky Geeks, an Alphabet-backed initiative based in Gaza that provides pre-seed investments, training and technology resources to Palestine\u2019s Gazan population, has been a beacon of entrepreneurship in the region.\nAll of that is now effectively gone, like the buildings in Gaza itself.\nIsrael is currently retaliating militarily against the attacks on its people, on its soil, and the hostages subsequently taken by Hamas \u2014 the ruling organization in Gaza that kidnapped at least 150 people and took them into Gaza during brutal attacks on Israel last weekend that killed 1,300 people.\nThat strategy has seen Israel pummeling the \u201cGaza Strip\u201d with bombs to eradicate it of Hamas and to get its hostages back. Over 1,500 people in Palestine so far have been killed as a result. The tech industry in Israel \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest export and its biggest single contributor to GDP \u2014 is also taking a big knock, but inevitably the impact on the smaller and more fragile ecosystem in Gaza has been significantly more serious. The physical, economic and societal destruction resulting from that leaves any future for the tech industry there in doubt.\nQuite simply, there is no escaping the consequences of the war for anyone, let alone tech workers.\n\u201cWhat is happening to tech in Gaza is that Israel is crunching it. Obliterating it,\u201d one source inside the territory told TechCrunch.\nIsrael has now amassed soldiers near the north of Gaza, ahead of an expected ground offensive into the densely populated enclave. About 1.1 million people living in northern areas have been told to leave in the next day. The UN has warned of \u201cdevastating humanitarian consequences\u201d from these latest moves. A total blockade on the territory is being enforced with fuel, food and water running out. Israel says it won\u2019t lift the restrictions unless Hamas frees all hostages.\nSpeaking to Ryan Sturgill, an American national and former head of the Gaza Sky Geeks (GSG) accelerator run by sponsor Mercy Corps, an NGO aid organization, the situation on the ground appears dire, after waves of shelling by the Israeli military.\n\u201cThe area around the the Mercy Corps building, which housed Gaza Sky Geeks, has been leveled. The structure is standing but blown out. The front of it is sort of ripped off,\u201d he said.\nGaza Sky Geeks is the largest tech hub in Palestine, providing a wide range of tech training at scale. In 2022, 5,000 coders and developers from across the West Bank and Gaza graduated from the program.\nVideo evidence (and pictured above) posted on LinkedIn shows a blown-out building with the Mercy Corps sign.\n\u201cWho knows what\u2019s going to happen. The offices are destroyed, the fiber lines are destroyed. The universities are destroyed. Three main universities in Gaza that produce all the computer science grads are leveled. I don\u2019t even know if people will ever be able to go back to Northern Gaza after what\u2019s happening today.The educational institutions that are there are gone,\u201d Sturgill added.\nHe had been helping Palestinian tech startups raise capital in the West Bank and Gaza since January.\n\u201cUntil now, there had been a pretty significant growth. A lot of companies in Saudi Arabia have been setting up back offices [in Palestine] for development for all sorts of new companies and even apps that are now growing in the Gulf, because Saudi has been growing so quickly on the tech front. Nvidia, and other international companies, has outsourcing operations in Palestine. Apple has outsourcing operations, Microsoft has R&D, and they would even like to see those expand. There\u2019s companies that had 200 developers sitting in offices in Ramallah,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to all of the heads of these different offices; most of them are in in Israel. They are very positive people who want to try to support the tech industry there and those efforts have been working well and growing,\u201d he added.\nIndeed, one of the main Palestinian VC funds, Ibtikar, had recently raised its second fund of $30 million.\nHigh-growth companies emerging from Palestine include Mena Analytics (data analytics, invested in by Flat6Labs); Olivery (last-mile logistics, Flat6Labs, Gaza Sky Geeks Ibtikar Fund); Coretava (employee and customer loyalty); and SellEnvo (an Amazon fulfillment partner).\nSturgill said that as well as the intensely difficult conditions in Gaza, which is being hit by Israeli missiles, the situation in Ramallah is \u201csuper tense. I feel like the situation is going to get significantly worse there over the coming weeks.\u201d\nIliana Montauk, co-founder and CEO of Manara \u2014 a social impact startup funded by Y Combinator, Seedcamp, Reid Hoffman, Eric Ries, Marc Benioff, Paul Graham, and Jessica Livingston, among others \u2014 told TechCrunch via email that connectivity has decreased significantly in the past 24 hours.\n\u201cThough Gaza has been bombed many times before, this time is completely different for the tech sector for several reasons. Electricity was cut off to the entire [Gaza] strip. A significant amount of infrastructure has been bombed (including both ISPs and many tall apartment buildings that hold cell phone towers). Entire middle-class neighborhoods are being destroyed.\u201d\nShe said in the past if an entire neighborhood got destroyed, it was usually one bordering Israel and a poorer area, thus less impacting the tech sector.\n\u201cThe tech sector is almost completely unable to function in Gaza right now,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people are in too much danger to be able to work; some have evacuated three times in the past 24 hours, moving from friend\u2019s house to family house, because each neighborhood they end up in is the next one being bombed. They usually receive warnings to evacuate their homes 10 minutes before a bombing, so they don\u2019t sleep and monitor the situation constantly ready to evacuate in a minute\u2019s notice.\n\u201cMost people have lost cell phone connections and internet access completely, or have some access to 2G only on their cell phones. Electricity is no longer being provided even for a few hours a day now, and people are running out of gas for their generators,\u201d she added.\nManara has around 100 software engineers in Gaza, some working remotely for tech companies in Silicon Valley\/Europe.\nMontauk said one software engineer who works at Upwork disappeared for several days, until being found alive.\nDalia Awad, whose Medium post about getting into Google from Gaza went viral in 2021 (it was at one point #1 on Hacker News and tweeted by Paul Graham), returned to Gaza after her internships at Google and Datadog to graduate from university. She had a full-time job offer at Datadog in Paris but decided to stay home in Gaza and look for a remote job so she could be close to family.\nOn Tuesday she wrote to Montauk, saying: \u201cTonight was the worst night ever. My family and I are good, thankfully. The bombing was everywhere and we couldn\u2019t know where it was because there was no internet. Many of my friends lost their houses in the Rimal area. There is no wifi internet, we connect to the cellular data on our phones but it\u2019s only 2G and it connects for a few minutes then cuts off. We can only send Whatsapp messages. So we can\u2019t really read news on social media. In the morning we saw these videos from our friends who shared it on whatsapp but it takes FOREVER to download a video of a few seconds.\u201d\nMontauk said Awad had not responded to her in the past day.\nMontauk, a former director of Gaza Sky Geeks, said: \u201cBefore this escalation, the Gaza tech scene was growing. I was just in Riyadh and met companies that hire entire software development teams in Gaza. Upwork and other Silicon Valley companies are now hiring software engineers remotely from Gaza. In addition, some had left to work abroad at companies like Google, Amazon, Qualtrics, etc. Last time I was in Gaza a year ago, almost everyone I talked to asked me how they could get a job and leave Gaza. They were worried about more bombings and wanted to bring their children up in a place without such a high risk. These people just want to live normal lives.\u201d\nThose who are living in the West Bank say the activity in Gaza has had an inevitable impact.\n\u201cFor a Palestinian young woman like me living in the West Bank, I can confirm that there has been a noticeable freeze in terms of activity,\u201d said Leen Abubaker of Flow Accelerator and co-founder at Sawaed19. \u201cTech companies are either operating on a very limited scale, with employees struggling to reach their offices in the West Bank due to unsafe roads blocked by Israeli occupation forces and settlers, or they have been forced out of business entirely in Gaza.\u201d\nShe added that a number of buildings in Gaza that are key to the tech industry there, such as Burj Al-Watan, had been destroyed by Israeli airstrikes and that the tech industry is not the first priority for people in the urgent situation. \u201cHow can you possibly detach from the distressing reality and cling to the remaining shreds of hope for your business?\u201d\nMohammad Alnobani is a Palestinian founder of The Middle Frame, an Arab stock image platform powered by AI tools that aims to shatter stereotypes about the Arab world through images and reducing bias in AI.\nHe told me he was on his way back from the One Young World Summit in Belfast, speaking about peace and reconciliation, and about to reach the borders to cross to Palestine to get back to his family, when the war broke out.\n\u201cThe borders closed down and I had to turn around and go back to Jordan,\u201d he said. \u201cI am still there, continuously checking on my family in Jerusalem, and trying to reach out to my connections in Gaza.\u201d His co-founder, Raya Fatayer, is in Ramallah, staying at home with her baby and husband, not able to travel.\n\u201cOur fellow entrepreneurs in Gaza had their homes demolished by air strikes, some we can\u2019t even reach anymore since the electricity is out and they have no power,\u201d he said. \u201cDealing with the situation while trying our best to move forward with our work is a daily challenge.\u201d\nHe said this outbreak of hostilities with Israel is clearly different: \u201cBefore, every time Gaza faced air strikes, we knew that certain areas were almost safe. Clearly today, nobody is safe.\u201d\n(This piece was later edited to include relevant information about the attacks by Hamas).\n\nThis article, authored by Mike Butcher, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-14 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":598}
{"title":"Consistent policy is key to unlocking the climate tech boom, but the UK\u2019s U-turn isn\u2019t helping","context":"## Consistent policy is key to unlocking the climate tech boom, but the UK\u2019s U-turn isn\u2019t helping\n\nWhen British prime minister Rishi Sunak appeared in front of the hastily assembled press on September 20, the letter-crammed slogan on his lectern caused the country to squint: \u201cLong-term decisions for a brighter future,\u201d it read.\nWe now know, of course, there was little in the speech that followed that brought hope. Certainly not concerning the technological fight for our future climate.\nNot that long ago, the UK seemed a rather brighter beacon in the industrial transition toward reversing the global climate breakdown. The countrywide goals were laid out. COP26 at least offered a forum and a spotlight. London has made strides in establishing itself as a hub for green tech startups. On the narrow but viable path toward net zero, leaders were at least taking the right steps.\nThen came the nadir of the last few weeks.\nLast week, with the government\u2019s already infamous U-turn on its green pledges, the nation joined in a consternated chorus with global leaders to lament the prime minister\u2019s short-sighted choice. Sunak has pushed back the British net-zero transition timeline by at least five years.\nThe first and most galling concern is, obviously, the consequences for the future of our species on this planet. The next biggest issue, currently being voiced by leaders across industries and especially within the climate tech and climate finance sectors, is the message it sends out to those of us in the trenches actually trying to build technology to change the world and enable a sustainable future.\nThat message is loud and clear: The U.K. government isn\u2019t willing to be consistent when it comes to climate crisis response policy, which, aside from capital and the support of nascent tech markets, is one of the most critical things anyone in our sector can hope for.\nFor entrepreneurs, innovators and businesses to thrive and unlock the economic potential that comes from creating new industries, we need a consistent approach from the government.\nI care about this because, as Americans who chose to build a biocatalyst engineering company here in the U.K., we\u2019re acutely aware of the impact such a reversal of policy has on every stage of our sector\u2019s existence. All major technological innovation ultimately comes from government support at the very beginning. We wouldn\u2019t have affordable solar panels, microchips, mobile phones or the internet without government funding, government subsidies, government encouragement and government infrastructure. You can\u2019t scale technology that is going to make a considerable impact without upfront capital to match.\nIn January of this year, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt unveiled a long-term vision to grow the economy, saying, \u201cI want the world\u2019s tech entrepreneurs, life science innovators and clean energy companies to come to the U.K. because it offers the best possible place to make their vision happen.\u201d Unless his long-term vision was only meant to last until the end of the summer, for entrepreneurs, innovators and businesses to thrive and unlock the economic potential that comes from creating new industries, we need a consistent approach from the government.\nWe have enormous fiscal potential. Within the U.K. climate tech community, we are working to create high-paying jobs and value for investors across just about every asset class. And collectively \u2014 hell, individually \u2014 our solutions could genuinely change the world.\nOf course, this is the common cause we should be united around. Our company is trying to move industry away from a reliance on fossil fuels to make chemicals, among other things. But the impact of these political spasms and contradictions in our climate commitments has on, say, an EV battery business \u2014 which has just seen the market demand for its output slide down the road by five years \u2014 isn\u2019t hard to appreciate. If giants like Ford are feeling the frustration, imagine the mood at a small green tech startup.\nSo what\u2019s the play? How can the government support those striving against an increasingly insecure (and insincere) backdrop?\nThe response of any tech company impacted by last week\u2019s news surely has to be this.\nFirst, we need a consistent macroeconomic policy. This has a major impact on startups raising and deploying capital into climate R&D. The global economic contraction has made it difficult for these businesses to raise any money. Overall approaches to the economy have trickle-down effects on how we, as businesses, make money and run our operations. Right down to salaries, which alone are hard to keep up with inflation-based pay rises.\nThe second is a consistent tax policy. One of the most critical things for startups is research and development (R&D) tax credits. This was a lifeline that gave small, research-intensive companies months of budget runway every year, as it effectively saw them get a third of the money spent in R&D back. The government announced it would be scrapping that last year, and it is only thanks to a lobbying effort spearheaded by the Startup Coalition that, at the last minute, a portion of that tax credit was able to be preserved.\nWhich leads to the third and most important point: A consistent climate policy. The impact of not having one is playing out in real time, right now. Sunak\u2019s public U-turn doesn\u2019t just undermine science and play into the hands of the climate skeptics. It also plows headlong into the future of any climate tech company whose launch plans have to be aligned around decarbonization timelines. This will damage economic confidence. People will lose jobs. And action, alas, will be further delayed.\nIn the end, it\u2019s simple: Inconsistency breeds uncertainty. So give us consistency. It is possible for our sector to succeed in spite of bad policies. But to thrive, we need consistent resolutions and behavior from a government that actually cares about leading in this critical fight. Given the colossal stakes, which were at least recently taken seriously, is that really asking too much?\n\nThis article, authored by Carrie Andrews, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-13 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":599}

The Air can handle some light video editing if the need arises, but if you need more power, spring for one of the newer, beefier options.\nMacBook Pro Photograph: Apple\nWe really only recommend this MacBook Pro (7\/10, WIRED Review) if you want the touch bar. It does have the same M2 chip as the 13-inch MacBook Air (our top pick in our Best MacBooks guide), but it still comes with the same 13.3-inch display, 720p webcam, and two Thunderbolt USB-C ports. Performance is great, and there's reliable battery life, but we don't suggest it for processor-intensive workloads.\nMacBook Air Photograph: Apple\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first large-screen option within the Air family. It packs all the same features as the 13-inch MacBook Air including a redesigned chassis, 1080p webcam, and M2 chip\u2014while still maintaining a lightweight and thin design. It's an excellent option for those who spend all day working off a laptop and don't want to plug into an external monitor.\nThis is our favorite external keyboard in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. It's a great option if you're a fan of the Magic Keyboard and are looking to fully replicate your MacBook setup. However, this version is fairly bare-bones\u2014it doesn't come with a Touch ID button or the same function row keys as the M-series MacBooks (that model isn't on sale, sadly). But it does come with the standard keys like playback controls, a Mission Control key, as well as a number pad. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this keyboard, so far.\nApple Studio Display Photograph: Apple\nThe Studio Display (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) has a spacious 27-inch display that's perfect for juggling multiple apps at the same time and a 5K resolution that's stunningly sharp (there's no HDR though, so colors look slightly more contrasty and saturated compared to the neutral tones on Apple's Pro Display XDR). Although it's pricey, this is an excellent monitor for those who want a really accurate and sharp screen. Equipped with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers, it's ideal for video calls too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, yet.\nIf you're constantly working on the go, a portable monitor is a great way to get more screen real estate. This one from Mobile Pixels attaches to your laptop screen using magnets (you'll have to be comfortable with sticking and leaving adhesive magnets on the back of your laptop) and connects via a USB-C cable. Simply slide it out to reveal a 13-inch display. It adds some bulk and thickness to your laptop, but you can remove it when it's not in use.\nWe love this laptop stand for those who prefer working from your bed or couch. The stand's height isn't adjustable, but you have the option to raise the base to position it at the best angle for typing, watching a movie on a tablet, or sketching. There's also extra space for your coffee mug and a small drawer for storing knickknacks.\nTwelve South StayGo Mini USB-C Hub Photograph: Twelve South\nWe've used this hub with iPads, but it's also great for MacBooks. Plug it in via the USB-C port on your laptop and you'll have access to another USB-C port for passthrough charging, a USB-A port, an HDMI output, and a headphone jack. It's also fairly compact and thin, so it won't add to much bulk to your laptop.\nThis is the runner-up to the aforementioned Twelve South StayGo Mini in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. With support for up to three displays at once (either DisplayPort or HDMI for each), it's an excellent choice for anyone using multiple monitors to get work done. The dock also packs six USB 3.0 ports (two on the front, four in the back) and a gigabit Ethernet port. All you have to do is plug in your MacBook for a multi-monitor setup instantly. With an output of up to 60 watts, you can also the dock to charge your laptop as well. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\nWe recommend Satechi's 108-watt wall charger if you own a MacBook Pro. It comes with three USB-C ports, each with the ability to charge at 100 watts if only one device is connected (making it perfect for the 16-inch MacBook Pro). But if you want to charge three gadgets simultaneously, it'll charge them at 45, 30, and 30 watts, respectively, 58, 30, and 20 watts, or 65, 20, and 20 watts, depending on what you're charging. It's also on the larger side, but it's not as big as the one from Apple, and the plug folds up too.\nSatechi 165-Watt GaN Four-Port Charger Photograph: Satechi\nThis handy charger has enough power to juice up two MacBook Pro models simultaneously. But it's also great if you have a lot of devices around your desk that constantly need to be charged. It has a little stand to prop it up, a short cord that goes out to an outlet, and four USB-C ports that output 100 watts each. It dipped lower to $90 back in July, but this is still a great deal.\nWe've featured this deal a few times during previous shopping holidays. It's still a good one. This tablet stand is included in several WIRED guides, including the Best iPad Accessories and the Best Work-from-Home Gear. The stand is lightweight, portable, and easy to use.\nApple Watch and Strap Deals\nRead our Best Apple Watch and Best Apple Watch Accessories guides for more.\nApple Watch SE Photograph: Apple\nIf you don't need all the extensive capabilities that come with the Apple Watch Series 9, then the second-generation Apple Watch SE is a great option for most people. It can still track important health and fitness features, and with the latest S8 chip, you'll also get the redesigned Compass app and Crash Detection. It has support for WatchOS 10 too, so you don't have to worry about missing out on the latest software updates. This is the lowest price we've tracked yet. The larger 44-mm version is also on sale for $229 ($50 off).\nApple Watch Ultra 2 Photograph: Apple\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old but it's already on sale. It's our favorite smartwatch for outdoor sports. It packs a new (and bright) 3,000-nit display, the latest S9 chip for faster processing, and the new ultra-wideband chip for precision-locating your phone. As with last year's version, it also comes equipped with a useful Action button and the three-mic array. It's a great option if you're heavily into outdoor sports and are looking for a rugged, full-functioning smartwatch to take along with you. It's also the Apple Watch with the best battery life thanks to its massive size.\nApple Silver Milanese Loop Photograph: Apple\nThe Silver Milanese Loop band is a great metal band for when you're not using your Apple Watch for workouts. It's made from stainless steel, the thin mesh is extremely flexible, and the magnetic clasp makes it easy to adjust the sizing. This deal applies to the 41-mm size in silver and graphite, but the 45-mm band is also on sale.\nThis is the best band for the Apple Watch Ultra in our Best Apple Watch Accessories guide. It's made from an elastomer with a titanium buckle. We specifically like that it's stretchy, bright, and fits small wrists. The band is also easy to wash and shows dirt much less easily than the fabric bands. It's compatible with the large 45-mm Apple Watch Series 8 as well.\nWe like this microfiber mat since it keeps your desk looking nice and clean, and doubles as a giant mousepad. It's pretty minimalist and only comes in black, but at this sale price that's all we need.\nEarbud and Headphone Deals\nRead our Best Wireless Earbuds guide for more.\nAirPods Pro Photograph: Apple\nThe latest version of the AirPods Pro (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) was just announced last month at Apple's hardware event and they're already on sale. These buds are identical to the old pair on the outside, but they pack some changes internally. In addition to slightly improved sound, there are also new Adaptive Audio features and a new Conversation Awareness mode (that turns audio down and lowers the sound of the background so you can hear someone talking to you). The version with the Lightning port is currently out of stock, but who wants those anyway?\nThe Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones (7\/10, WIRED Review) pack excellent calling and noise canceling, good sound quality, and fantastic wireless range. They also offer a stable fit and compact design. These headphones are missing a few key features though, including sensors for auto-pause and multi-band EQ. But with improved sound quality and ANC, along with a few cool extra features for both Android and Apple devices, these are still a solid option\u2014especially if they're on sale. This is the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\nBeats Fit Pro Photograph: Beats\nThe Beats Fit Pro (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) deliver a comfortable fit, great sound, and seamless integration with both iOS and Android. They also feature active noise canceling and decent mics. Equipped with Apple's proprietary H1 headphone chip, they work like AirPods when used with an iPhone. These work great on Android too\u2014complete with an app that allows you to perform a fit test and customize the controls. They dipped to $125 back in August, but this is still a good deal.\nWIRED associate editor Parker Hall says the Studio Buds fit better than most buds he's ever tried. He also likes that they have extremely useful physical buttons on the outside to play and pause audio as well as control noise cancelation. They'll also stay put in your ears even when breaking a sweat and sound as good as Apple's AirPods Pro. This is the same price we saw on Prime Day in July, but it's also the lowest the price has dipped.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro Photograph: Beats\nThe Powerbeats Pro (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) came out in 2019, but these are still our top recommendation for earbuds with the most secure fit\u2014making them an excellent option for the most intensive workouts. With an IPX4 water-resistance rating, they'll also stay protected from sweat. They have excellent sound quality and offer an impressive nine hours of battery life (with an extra 18 hours in the case). It's worth noting that many of the features won't work with an Android phone, but the core functions will.\nApple Charger Deals\nCheck out our Best Apple 3-in-1 Wireless Chargers and Best MagSafe Power Banks guides for more.\nAnker 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Cube Photograph: Anker\nThis 2.5-inch cube from Anker is a great compact charger. It comes with a MagSafe pad on top (that charges at up to 15 watts), a top section that hinges to a 60-degree angle to reveal a charging surface for your AirPods, and a shelf on the side that has a built-in Apple Watch charger (which can comfortably accommodate any Apple Watch including the Ultra). You'll also get a 5-foot cable and a 30-watt charger in the box. It supports fast charging too.\nAnker 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Charging Dock Photograph: Anker\nThis is another excellent and compact 3-in-1 wireless charger from Anker. A MagSafe pad charges iPhones up to 15 watts at a slanted angle, and on the side is a standard Apple Watch puck (no fast-charging support). In the space inside the triangle is where you can place your AirPods Pro (or any other wireless earbuds case) to top them up.\nBelkin 3-in-1 Wireless Charger Photograph: Belkin\nThis is currently our favorite Apple 3-in-1 wireless charger. The T-shaped design is compact, so it won't take up that much space on your nightstand or desk, and the charging tree suspends two of your devices midair. You can use it to charge your iPhone (at the fastest 15-watt charging speed Apple allows), fast-charge the Apple Watch Series 7\/8\/9\/Ultra, and use the base to charge your AirPods Pro (or AirPods with a wireless charging case) simultaneously all from a single outlet. It's normally around $150 but was discounted to $100 in August, so it's possible that Prime Day won't be your last opportunity to snag it for less.\nAnker MagGo 637 Photograph: Anker\nAll you have to do is stick your iPhone to this adorable little orb and it'll start charging. On the back, you'll also find two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and three AC outlets. It's both cute and tidy. It fluctuates in price very often, but it's still a good deal.\nSatechi's fold-up wireless charging stand has a 10,000-mAh capacity (complete with LEDs to show you how much juice you have left) and can wirelessly charge both your phone and a wireless earbuds case (as long as it's Qi-certified). There's also a USB-C port to power up a third device. The only gripe we have is that it's slow\u2014delivering 10 watts of wireless charging power for phones (7.5 watts for iPhones), 5 watts for earbuds, and 10 watts via the USB-C port.\nApple 35-Watt Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter Photograph: Apple\nApple's dual USB-C port power adapter is an essential accessory if you have a tendency to forget to pack chargers for your devices on the go. With two USB-C ports, you can use it to recharge both your iPhone and MacBook simultaneously. Rated at 35 watts, it's also powerful enough to recharge an iPad Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nThe MagSafe Duo makes for an excellent travel companion if you own an iPhone and an Apple Watch. Rather than packing separate chargers, the MagSafe Duo combines chargers for both all within a compact, foldable form factor. You can also use it to charge your AirPods (if it comes with a wireless charging case) and other Qi-certified devices.\niOttie Velox Pro Magnetic Wireless Cooling Car Dash Mount Photograph: iOttie\niOttie's Velox Pro Magnetic Wireless Cooling Charger is great for those who prefer a mount on your dash or windshield and have an iPhone 12 or later. The suction cup attaches to a dashboard pad or windshield and proved secure in our testing. The telescopic arm (combined with a ball joint) also delivers a wide range of movement to help you find the ideal position. Unfortunately, it maxes out at 7.5 watts for charging, but you can remove the USB-C charging cable when the iPhone is fully charged. There's also a built-in fan to help keep the temperature down when it's hot out.\nAnker Nano USB-C Power Bank Photograph: Anker\nThis is a great power bank if you don't want to worry about carrying a cable around, since it simply slots into the bottom of your phone\u2014thanks to the built-in rotating USB-C or Lightning connector (MFi certified). It also offers 5,000 mAh of energy, and there's a USB-C port for recharging it, complete with a short cable. However, it might not be a good pick if you have a thick case.\nThis 2-in-1 charger is featured in our guide to the Best MagSafe Accessories. The price matches the lowest we have tracked. It doesn't have a built-in Apple Watch charger, but it can top off your compatible wireless earbuds whilst simultaneously charging your iPhone. It charges at the maximum 15-watt rate, and you can turn your iPhone sideways for iOS 17\u2019s new StandBy mode, converting it into a bedside alarm clock.\nAnker 737 Power Bank Photograph: Anker\nWe just added this power bank as our top upgrade pick in our guide to the Best Portable Chargers. It's pricey, but today's deal makes it more accessible. It charges from zero to completely full in an hour and boasts a whopping 24,000-mAh capacity. And it's powerful enough to charge laptops and tablets as well as phones and other gadgets. There's even a built-in display to monitor stats like temperature and remaining battery percentage.\nNomad's wireless charger is one of our favorite MagSafe wireless chargers. It delivers the maximum 15-watt charging speed possible, but it's not meant to be held up while you use the phone. It doesn't have a power adapter but includes a USB-C-to-USB-C cable. It'll sit securely on your desk and can charge an Apple Watch, too.\nThis travel kit from ESR works well if you want something that can prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. It can also display your Apple Watch in Nightstand mode, so you can peek and see how long before you must get out of bed. The main body folds open with a MagSafe charging pad for your iPhone and a slot behind for your AirPods. Unfortunately, it doesn't support fast charging and it's capped at 7.5 watts and 5 watts for the iPhone and Apple Watch, respectively. But it's a good, affordable charger. It dipped a little lower to $40 back in July, but this is still a solid deal.\nPhone Cases and Accessory Deals\nBe sure to read our Best MagSafe Accessories and Best iPhone 15 Cases guides for other picks.\nPhotograph: iOttie\nWhat we like best about this phone mount is that you can use it one-handed. The arms automatically close around the phone when you place it against the trigger button. To remove it, press the release bars. There's also a telescopic arm and ball joint that allows you to tweak the placement and set an ideal angle. We also love the clever magnetic tab that attaches the charging cable to the back of the mount, to keep from having to fish around for it. Plus, it's super sturdy\u2014even on bumpy roads.\nIf you're tired of people glancing over at your display in public, the Glass Elite Privacy 360 will block anyone from seeing content on your screen from the sides. It also feels great and is fairly easy to apply. Our only gripe is that Zagg's screen protectors are expensive. This has hit as low as $24, but it's a solid deal if you're in need of a screen protector sooner rather than later.\nCasetify Case Photograph: Casetify\nCasetify offers an overwhelming variety of case designs, but they can get pricey. So, if you've been eyeing one, we suggest taking advantage of the storewide sale. We like the Impact MagSafe cases, which have chunky bumpers and edges to protect the screen and are also made of plant-based materials as well as upcycled Casetify cases. The Bounce case is another solid choice that feels more rugged, but they're quite bulky. It's worth noting the sale doesn't apply to iPhone 15 products.\nOtterBox Figura Photograph: Otterbox\nWe like OtterBox cases, and many are 20 percent off, including chargers, cables, and other accessories. We've got recommendations in our iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 case guides.\nCase-Mate Blox Photograph: Case-Mate\nIf you're looking for a trendy case, look no further than this blocky and rectangular one. The bright neon color makes the phone pop, and it also looks super unique. Aesthetics aside, it's also a fairly well-rounded case. The cutouts are all accurate, the buttons are great, and it comes with MagSafe support. We tested this case with the iPhone 14, but this one is for the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nPhotograph: Apple\nApple AirTags are our favorite Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users. This isn't a crazy sale, but getting these in a bundle of four means you can keep track of every set of keys, your luggage for a trip, or even your kids' backpack all at once.\nThose with an iPhone 14 or earlier can never have too many Lightning cables. These cables from Nomad are durable, available in different lengths, and come with the choice between USB-C and USB-A for the other end.\nRetailer Sale Pages\n\nThis article, authored by Brenda Stolyar, was published by Wired on 2023-10-10 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":600}
{"title":"NTPC: Why investors can accumulate this stock","context":"## NTPC: Why investors can accumulate this stock\n\nThe Power Ministry has scheduled tenders of around 50 GW annually of renewable energy for the next five years, to achieve the target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity. Alongside the government\u2019s thrust on ramping up renewable energy capacity, building incremental thermal capacity has also been a priority. This is because energy security has become an important issue with consistent increase in demand in recent years; power demand is now at all-time high\/peak levels.\nPSU thermal major NTPC appears to be well-placed to capture both themes \u2014 energy transition and energy security.\nSince our accumulate rating on NTPC in bl.portfolio dated August 13, 2023, the stock has gained around 48 per cent. This has been majorly on account of growth in earnings as well as re-rating in the stock from the trailing P\/E of around 10 times then, to 12 times now. During FY23, the company\u2019s revenue increased by around 32 per cent. While there was flattish growth in PAT during the period on account of increase in fuel cost, the same grew nearly 30 per cent YoY in H1FY24. NTPC is now trading at a one-year forward P\/E of around 11 times, which is around 35 per cent higher than its historical five-year average P\/E of around 8.2 times.\nThe re-rating in the stock has happened mainly due to company-specific and industry-level structural positives (which justify current premium to historical average) and the company\u2019s aggressive capacity addition plans. We maintain our postive stance on NTPC and investors can continue to accumulate the stock on account of growth plans in place, along with the strong revenue and earnings visibility due to assured return model. Further, it is offering a decent dividend yield of around 3 per cent.\nBusiness\nNTPC earns majority of revenue from sale of power generated from thermal-based generating stations. More than 90 per cent of its revenue is tied to long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) under cost-plus based tariff regime, which ensures pass-through of costs such as plant capacity charge, supplementary capacity charge (emission control system cost), interest on loan, interest on working capital and energy cost (fuel) and allows ROE (Return on equity) of 15.5 per cent over and above these costs.\nThe complete recovery of capacity charges is allowed when the plant shows technical availability (plant availability factor) over and above the normative level i.e. typically 85 per cent wherein the plant should be technically available to generate power with sufficient coal in place. However, do note that pass-through is allowed subject to normative parameters and provisions defined in the PPA.\nNTPC has assured coal supply, given its long-term fuel supply agreements (FSAs) with Coal India Limited (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) for supply of coal for 20 years for total Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ) of 183 MTPA. Further, the company has captive coal mining with capacity of 71 MMT.\nRecent performance\nDuring H1FY24, the company reported PAF (plant availability factor) in its coal-based generation stations to the tune of 93.32 per cent as against 92.05 per cent in H1FY23. Further, PLF (Plant Load Factor) i.e. capacity utilisation for the period has been 76.62 per cent against 77.27 per cent in the last year and national average of 68.75 per cent. The company reported a YoY increase in generation of around 4 per cent, reaching 212 billion units (BUs) in H1FY24. Coal supply during H1FY24 was 113 MMT, including 4 MMT of imported coal. The coal consumption during the corresponding previous period was 112 MMT, including 10 MMT of imported coal.\nThe company has reported flattish revenue growth in H1FY24 reaching close to \u20b988,058.44 crore. This has been on account of shutdown in certain plants due to repair work and grid restrictions, which is expected to improve, going forward, in the upcoming quarters, as per the management. The company saw a YoY growth of around 18 per cent in EBITDA reaching \u20b925,091 crore and thereby EBITDA margins expanded from 25 per cent to 29 per cent on a YoY basis. This has been mainly on account of lower fuel cost due to reduced share of imported coal. The imported coal price rose steeply in FY23, the pass-through of which might not have been allowed completely, which resulted in decline in margins in FY23.\nGrowth triggers in place\nNTPC plans to have 130 GW of installed power generation capacity comprising 60 GW of renewable energy from the current level of 3.3 GW. While this is quite a long-term target, in the near term, NTPC plans to add 15-16 GW of renewable energy by FY26. Currently, around 7.7 GW of RE capacity is under construction and 11 GW under different stages. Further, as all-time high peak power demand makes the case for having thermal-based capacity as an energy security, NTPC plans to add 10-11 GW of thermal-based capacity by FY26. The target for the same has been raised from 7 GW earlier. This will imply capacity growth during FY23-26 to the tune of 10-11 per cent CAGR from the current levels.\nThe management has given the guidance of capex to the tune of around \u20b928,373 crore for FY24. For FY25 and FY26 it will be on similar lines while capex will shoot up on account on growth in renewable-related capex post then as per the management.\nDuring our previous call, we highlighted that NTPC was attempting to monetise its stake in its renewable energy arm NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) by way of selling stake to a strategic partner. However, during Q1FY24 earnings call, management highlighted that the company is now looking to unlock value by way of IPO rather than onboarding strategic investor. However, the timeline is not yet certain as it will depend on market-based factors and within how much time substantial RE capacity is there on the ground.\nThe company has a D\/E of around 1.24 times as on H1FY24 and can, on account of its stable business model, access debt at a cheaper rate as compared to private power generation companies. The reasonable D\/E gives NTPC scope for further debt financing to fund its capex requirements.\n\nThis article was published by Business Line on 2023-11-11 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":601}
{"title":"The world came tantalizingly close to a deal to phase out fossil fuels","context":"## The world came tantalizingly close to a deal to phase out fossil fuels\n\nWhat would have been a historic deal to tackle a planetary crisis slipped out of reach at the eleventh hour. Even so, climate-vulnerable countries and environmental advocates scored some key wins with clean energy after heated climate negotiations wrapped up in the United Arab Emirates, a top oil- and gas-producing country.\nThis was the closest yet that countries have gotten to striking a global deal to phase out the use of coal, oil, and gas. But the summit was arguably still a home game for fossil fuel interests who threw their weight around the United Nations climate conference, called the 28th Conference of the Parties or COP28, where tens of thousands of delegates and activists from nearly every nation on Earth have gathered over the past two weeks to wrangle over the future of fossil fuels.\nNow that the dust has settled, these are some of the biggest decisions made in Dubai that could determine how we power our world in the future.\nThe beginning of the end for fossil fuels?\n\u201cThis text is a step forward on our path towards phasing out fossil fuels, but is not the historic decision we hoped for.\u201d\nMore than 100 countries came to the table pushing for an official agreement to \u201cphase out fossil fuels.\u201d Doing so would address a glaring omission in the 2015 Paris accord, which never actually mentions coal, oil, or natural gas despite being an international agreement to stop global warming. Alas, countries still aren\u2019t facing the root of the problem.\nBringing the deal to the finish line required nearly 200 countries to agree on the same language. Ultimately, draft language explicitly calling for the phaseout of fossil fuels was stricken from the final text of agreements brokered at this year\u2019s climate talks. What the world got instead is a weaker call for \u201ctransitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade.\u201d A landmark United Nations-backed climate report in 2018 found that countries need to cut their emissions nearly in half by 2030 to meet goals set in the Paris climate accord.\nThe final text also calls on countries to work toward \u201caccelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power.\u201d To be clear, every word in that phrase is pretty dirty. Coal of course is the most polluting fossil fuel, one reason why it\u2019s hard to ignore in a climate agreement. But a commitment to phase down its use is decidedly weaker than one to phase it out. It mirrors language in a recent letter addressed to participating governments from COP28 president Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber \u2014 who also happens to be the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.\nThe UN\u2019s decision to hold the summit in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer, wound up giving the fossil fuel industry unprecedented access. There were more fossil fuel lobbyists in Dubai than at any climate conference in the 28 years the United Nations has convened it. Industry representatives for fossil fuels outnumbered delegations from every country present at the talks except the United Arab Emirates and Brazil. Al Jaber even used his position as COP28 president to lobby for oil and gas deals with other governments, according to an investigation by the BBC and the Centre for Climate Reporting.\nEven so, there were hopeful signs last week when draft documents coming out of the conference included options to incorporate language that called on countries to phase out fossil fuel use (there was also an option not to include such a clause). Then the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sent a letter to its member states pressuring them to \u201cproactively reject any text or formula that targets energy i.e. fossil fuels rather than emissions.\u201d\nFollowing the letter, language that had previously called on countries to phase out fossil fuels vanished from subsequent draft texts. Backlash was swift. \u201cThis obsequious draft reads as if OPEC dictated it word for word,\u201d former US vice president Al Gore posted on X on Monday. \u201cCOP28 is now on the verge of complete failure.\u201d\nThat brings us back to the language coming out of COP28 to phase down unabated coal. Using the word \u201cunabated\u201d \u2014 whether for coal, oil, or gas \u2014 carves out a huge loophole for fossil fuels. It means that polluters can continue burning fossil fuels as long as they pair it with emerging technologies that capture greenhouse gas emissions (though typically not 100 percent of those emissions) that are still unproven at scale.\n\u201cThis text is a step forward on our path towards phasing out fossil fuels, but is not the historic decision we hoped for ... given the overwhelming momentum among countries in support of a renewable energy package and a long overdue fossil fuel phase out, we needed a far more ambitious result.\u201d Andreas Sieber, associate director of policy and campaigns for environmental group 350.org, said in a statement before the draft agreement was finalized at the conference\u2019s closing plenary.\nClean energy on the rise\nEven though the lack of a clear plan to phase out fossil fuels is a blow to climate action, this isn\u2019t exactly a zero sum game. Solar and wind power are already cheaper alternatives to coal, oil, and gas in most of the world when it comes to meeting new electricity demand. Nearly all of the world\u2019s new electricity supply over the next few years is expected to come from renewable and nuclear energy, according to the International Energy Agency. The agency, which was initially founded to safeguard the world\u2019s fuel supply after the 1970s oil crisis, called a global transition to clean energy \u201cunstoppable\u201d earlier this year and forecast that demand for coal, oil, and gas would peak this decade.\nWhen it comes down to it, getting cleaner sources of energy online looks inevitable at this point. There were some notable new commitments on the clean energy front in the final texts coming out of COP28, too. It calls for the tripling of renewable energy capacity globally by 2030, something that more than 100 countries had already pledged to do while negotiations were taking place last week.

{"title":"Daye now offers tampon-based STI screening \u2014 starting in the UK","context":"## Daye now offers tampon-based STI screening \u2014 starting in the UK\n\nU.K. femcare-turned-gynaecological-health startup, Daye, has expanded its tampon-based home screening service to add STI testing. The startup is billing this \u201cnon-invasive screening\u201d service for sexually transmitted infections as a \u201cworld first\u201d.\nThe \u201cSTI Diagnostic Tampon\u201d service uses Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing tech to detect the presence of pathogens. Daye is launching with the ability to test for five STIs \u2014 namely: Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomonas, mycoplasma and ureaplasma \u2014 which were selected because they are the most common STIs. But more tests are planned.\nThe move comes a year after the startup took the wraps off an ambitious push into gynaecological health \u2014 with the launch of a vaginal microbiome screening service. Daye tells TechCrunch it\u2019s had \u201cthousands\u201d of customers for that service \u2014 which is a little more complicated to engage with as samples need to be sent back along with an ice pack (and hopefully minimal postal delays) in order that the lab can detect live pathogens.\nThe STI test is simpler as the PCR test is looking for genetic material \u2014 dead or alive; this type of test doesn\u2019t distinguish \u2014 so the user just needs to pop their sample in the extraction solution provided before they post it off for analysis.\nDaye sells tampons for regular, menstrual use too, of course. But it\u2019s always been interested in doing more with the staple female hygiene product than just catching flow. Its signature product is a CBD-infused tampon for combating period cramps. Though it also sells a \u201cnude\u201d version (i.e. no CBD) \u2014 and that core offering is the basis for a growing range of vaginal- and sexual-health-screening services which repurpose the basic tampon as a novel sample collecting device.\nThe clever twist here is it makes what could be an intrusive test into something its customers are likely to be intimately familiar with \u2014 and literally as easy as inserting and removing a tampon.\nDaye didn\u2019t invent the idea of using tampons to test for STIs, as founder Valentina Milanova explained when we dug into its wider mission last year. U.K. university researchers pioneered menstrual tampon screening back in the 1990s. But Milanova is on a mission to expand the technique\u2019s use and utility \u2014 seeing it as a convenient way to help women learn a heck of a lot more about their own bodies from the comfort of their own bathrooms.\nThe startup also claims tampons make a better testing device than the swabs or other protocols a patient might be administered at a sexual health clinic or doctor\u2019s office since its test tampons collect more vaginal fluid and cover a larger surface area \u2014 so it contends this is both a more accurate way to STI test than a swab and more comfortable than a speculum.\nPCR testing, meanwhile, has gotten very familiar after the COVID-19 pandemic. Daye\u2019s STI test uses the same principle as this gold standard detection test for coronavirus \u2014 but in this case it\u2019s looking for trace (or more) amounts of genetic material from pathogens that cause STIs.\n\u201cThe specificity of PCRs ensures that false-positive results are reduced, providing a more reliable diagnosis,\u201d it suggests, also noting the test can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens in a single sample. So full marks for convenience.\nMore convenience is coming, too, as it adds more tests, too: Daye says HPV is next on its list \u2014 an STI which has been linked to increased cervical cancer risk.\nAnother on its list to add \u201csoon\u201d is to offer GBS screening for pregnant patients. \u201cGBS is a common bacteria often carried in the intestines or lower genital tract. While usually harmless in adults, it can cause severe infections in newborns if transmitted during delivery. Testing pregnant women for GBS allows for the timely administration of antibiotics during labour, significantly reducing the risk of neonatal infections,\u201d Daye tells us.\nThe startup also plans to offer herpes screening for everyone down the line.\nThe STI testing service is being launched in the U.K. first \u2014 at a cost of \u00a399 a pop \u2014 with the US slated to get the service \u201csoon\u201d. Daye is also aiming to expand screening services elsewhere in Europe, saying it\u2019s currently working on building out an aftercare offering to support patients across the EU.\nHow does the STI testing service work? The user receives a test kit in the post and, after self administering a vaginal swab by inserting and removing the test tampon and then preserving their sample as instructed, they post it sample back to Daye\u2019s partner lab for analysis \u2014 getting results digitally, via Daye\u2019s app, in a few days.\nFor a further \u00a329 they can also get a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d consultation about their results with a nurse. Users who don\u2019t purchase this optional extra, but do test positive for an STI, will receive a free five minute call to walk them through their results and advise on next steps, per Daye.\nOne question we had is related to how sexual health clinics may routinely test for HIV when a patient attends \u2014 i.e. even if they\u2019re at the clinic for another sexual health worry. So if more people choose to adopt at-home testing for STIs, thanks to Daye\u2019s convenient alternative, they may be missing out on the chance to acquire important health info \u2014 since clinics or doctor\u2019s offices can often nudge an attending patient to take the opportunity to test more widely while they\u2019re there in person.\nAsked how it\u2019s mitigating this risk, Daye told us: \u201cWe enable our patients to book in-clinic appointments for HIV screening, and in the future, we may also expand to at-home blood testing for HIV. We ensure that our patients are well-educated on the risks associated with HIV and are reminded of the need for regular testing. We\u2019d like to play a meaningful role in destigmatising sexual health and provide medically-backed advice on the recommended cadence of screening.\u201d\nThe startup also gave us a breakdown of the main customers for its novel vaginal microbiome screening service a year+ on from that launch \u2014 saying there are three main groups:\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-06 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":603}
{"title":"Cannabis use in pregnancy linked to small birth size, other poor outcomes","context":"## Cannabis use in pregnancy linked to small birth size, other poor outcomes\n\nUsing cannabis during pregnancy may come with a higher risk of poor outcomes, such as babies being born small for their gestational age, a new study suggests.\nAmong pregnant people who use cannabis, the risks are the highest for those who use the drug in both the first trimester and later in gestation, as opposed to only the first trimester, according to the study, published Tuesday (Dec. 12) in the journal JAMA .\n\"What I think this study evaluates, that has not been evaluated previously, is whether the timing and amount of exposure matters, and what we saw was that higher levels of cannabis exposure were associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes,\" first study author Dr. Torri Metz , an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Utah Health, told Live Science in an email. Using cannabis in the first trimester still carries risk, but the findings hint that stopping cannabis use within the first trimester could help prevent that risk from growing larger.\nNotably, the study reveals only a link between cannabis and certain poor pregnancy outcomes \u2014 it doesn't directly demonstrate that cannabis causes these effects. But it does suggest that \"cannabis use should be avoided during pregnancy to optimize maternal and neonatal [newborn] outcomes,\" the study authors wrote in the report.\nRelated: Eating just 2 cannabis gummies can put small kids at risk of toxic effects\nIn the study, the researchers screened frozen urine samples that had been collected from 9,200 pregnant people at eight U.S. medical centers. The participants were originally recruited between 2010 and 2013 for a long-term study on pregnancy outcomes and their samples have been stored since then.\nThe samples were taken during three time windows that respectively fell within the first trimester, the early second trimester, and the late second trimester into the third. For the new research, each sample was screened for a specific molecule that appears in urine when the body breaks down tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ), the psychoactive compound in cannabis.\nIn addition, the researchers reviewed the participants' medical records to look at their pregnancy outcomes. They took note of preterm births, stillbirths and instances when a newborn was born small for their gestational age; \"small\" was defined as being below the fifth percentile for their age and sex. They also noted when the mother experienced pregnancy-related high-blood-pressure disorders, such as gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.\nThese outcomes have been tied to dysfunction of the placenta, the organ that supplies a growing fetus with nutrients and oxygen while removing waste from the womb. Research in monkeys has suggested that cannabis exposure can alter gene activity in the placenta, and it's also linked to reduced oxygen and blood flow through the organ. In humans , cannabis exposure has been linked to slower-than-typical growth of the fetus, which can be related to problems with the placenta.\nIn the study, urine screening flagged 610 participants who had used cannabis in pregnancy. Nearly 200 used cannabis only in the first trimester, while the rest tested positive for cannabis both in the first trimester and later in pregnancy.\nParticipants who used cannabis had a higher risk of experiencing at least one of the poor pregnancy outcomes \u2014 nearly 26%, compared with 17.5% in the group that didn't use cannabis. The risk was highest for those who used cannabis late into pregnancy, and the risk also appeared to rise with the overall concentration of THC byproduct in a person's urine.\nThe researchers initially considered the pregnancy outcomes as a group, rather than separately, because \"we knew we did not have a large enough sample to examine all of these outcomes independently,\" Metz told Live Science. But as a secondary analysis, the researchers then zoomed in on specific pregnancy outcomes, to see which were most common in the available data.\nIn that analysis, cannabis use was linked to a higher chance that a baby would be born small, but it was not linked to a higher risk of high-blood-pressure disorders in pregnancy.\nCannabis use was also tentatively linked to a risk of stillbirth, with the group that used cannabis showing a higher rate than those who didn't use the drug. However, in a model that adjusted for other influential factors \u2014 such as nicotine exposure and the mother's age and insurance status \u2014 the cannabis-related stillbirth result was no longer statistically significant.\n\"There are other studies that have also found an association between cannabis use and stillbirth , so it is concerning that we also saw this association in unadjusted analyses,\" Metz said. However, because the link disappeared in the adjusted model, \"this also means that we likely needed a bigger cohort to look specifically at stillbirth as an outcome.\"\nFortunately, based on the current study's data, \"stillbirth is a rare outcome,\" Metz emphasized. Its risk just warrants further study in larger groups.\nThe current study has other limitations. For instance, the molecules in the frozen urine samples may have degraded somewhat over the years, although they were stored appropriately. The way people used cannabis is also unknown, so it's unclear if inhaling or taking edibles would come with different levels of risk, for example.\nAnd again, the study's design allows a link to be drawn between cannabis and pregnancy outcomes, but it can't say whether or how the drug actually caused the outcomes.\nThat said, \"I think this lends more evidence to the idea that there are potential risks, and really talk to patients about alternative methods of treating whatever it is they're hoping to treat with cannabis,\" Metz told JAMA in a podcast interview .\n\nThis article was published by Live Science: The Most Interesting Articles on 2023-12-13 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":604}
{"title":"Walks, tech and protein: how to parent your own parents","context":"## Walks, tech and protein: how to parent your own parents\n\nParenting no longer starts and stops with our children. Nor is it confined to those who have children. In a time of unrelenting change and ever-extending life, most of us will \u2013 at some stage \u2013 find ourselves \u201cparenting\u201d our own parents.\nIndeed, many of us \u2013 particularly those who had families later \u2013 will find ourselves simultaneously parenting our kids and our parents. In one breath we\u2019ll be begging our children to swap French fries for vegetables, and in the next breath we\u2019ll be urging our parents to exchange cake for sardines. Little wonder today\u2019s midlifers are known as the sandwich generation.\nThe relentless pace of technology \u2013 accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 has made everything infinitely more complicated, leaving many older (and not-so-old) people baffled and frustrated. In the last few years I\u2019ve witnessed friends and family dashing to help parents with poorly designed online banking systems, unruly fridge alarms, \u201cupgraded\u201d software that has changed beyond recognition, apps and phones that don\u2019t function as expected, and numerous other technical challenges.\nFrankly, technology is often baffling to me, too. Luckily I have kids who delight in parenting me \u2013 advising, explaining and guiding me on all things digital. But studies suggest that this helpfulness might not be as beneficial as we think. Grappling with new and baffling things forces the ageing brain to work in novel ways. A recent study from the University of Texas involving more than 200 elderly adults found that those who engaged with technology had better cognition and memory than their non-engaging peers.\nDigital engagement \u2013 whatever the device \u2013 protects the brain\nEven the stress we experience while battling with our computer can be helpful, sharpening our mental acuity. The study authors concluded that digital engagement \u2013 whatever the device \u2013 protects the brain. These findings reflect earlier studies that discovered that older people who made active use of technology were less likely to get dementia.\nDr Eamon Laird, researcher in health and ageing at Limerick university, agrees that we should be encouraging older parents to try new things. And the further out of their comfort zone they feel, the better. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to keep the mind active and fresh,\u201d he told me. \u201cNew challenges can help build and maintain new brain connections and can be good for brain and overall health.\u201d\nIf older people use technology to keep in touch with extended family and friends, that\u2019s a double whammy. When my 84-year-old mother recently joined Instagram, she not only expanded her grey matter but she also found an effective means of staying in touch with her grandchildren. Being social, says Laird, is as important as trying new things: \u201cResearch shows that those who are more social are also more resilient to chronic conditions and often have a stronger immune system.\u201d\nAnyone with older parents should be urging them out for a walk five days a week Dr Eamon Laird, health and ageing researcher\nDepression among the elderly is on the rise and often goes unnoticed. Gerontologists now believe that it is one of the most common psychiatric disorders among the elderly \u2013 with half of all cases going undiagnosed. When elderly parents become depressed (many of them come from a generation not accustomed to talking about their mental health), it can be difficult to know how to respond. But Laird\u2019s latest report suggests that a daily walk could help. His study of more than 4,000 older adults found that as little as 20 minutes of daily walking could cut the risk of depression by up to 43%. \u201cAnyone with older parents should be urging them out for a walk five days a week \u2013 and when they have a companion, the walk also doubles as a social occasion,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf they can walk for longer than 20 minutes, even better. Our study showed that the risk of depression fell in proportion to the time spent walking.\u201d\nAs well as a daily walk, Laird recommends vitamin D and B12 supplements \u2013 both of which appear to moderate the chance of depression in older people. \u201cDepression matters,\u201d he added. \u201cNot just because it reduces quality of life, but because in older people there seems to be a link between depression and dementia which we\u2019re still unpacking.\u201d\nHealth coach Susan Saunders found herself \u201cparenting\u201d her mother (who had dementia) while her own daughters were babies. \u201cI\u2019d advise anyone with a parent in the early stages of dementia to investigate all the available research trials. Start by joining Dementia Research, a nationwide register that matches volunteers to research programmes.\u201d\nEven if your parents don\u2019t require such intensive \u201cparenting\u201d, a simple supplement could help. A recent study from Columbia University involving 2,200 adults aged 60 and over found that an inexpensive multivitamin formulated specifically for older people improved cognition, memory and focus. In fact, the results were so marked that the researchers said the supplement could slow age-related memory decline by three years.\nBut while most of us can probably persuade our parents to take a multivitamin, suggesting they change their diet might be more complicated. Appetites fade as we age, chewing becomes more difficult and those living alone don\u2019t always feel inclined to cook. The important thing, say both Saunders and Laird, is that older people consume plenty of protein.\n\u201cOlder adults should be taking at least 1 to 1.5g of protein per kilogram of body weight,\u201d says Laird. \u201cDairy, fish or non-processed meat can help maintain muscle strength and function, reducing the risk of frailty as we age.\u201d\nIn truth, anyone over 50 would do well to follow these simple guidelines: engage with something new every day, take a daily walk of at least 20 minutes, socialise regularly, take a daily multivitamin for seniors and check the protein content of our meals. Perhaps we should think of it as self-parenting.\nGood groups for elders\nAge UK has a database of social activities and groups for older folk\nThe Walking Football Association keeps keen amateur footballers playing long into their 50s and 60s\nAction for Elders offers social and exercise programmes\nThe Centre for Ageing Better provides information on working and living as an older person\nu3a, a charity collective, provides local opportunities for people no longer in work to acquire new skills and knowledge\nAnnabel Streets is the co-author of The Age-Well Project: Easy Ways to a Longer, Healthier, Happier Life (Piatkus) and co-founder of The Age-Well Project\n\nThis article, authored by Annabel Streets, was published by The Guardian on 2023-10-10 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":605}
{"title":"Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a perfect end for the Switch","context":"## Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a perfect end for the Switch\n\nThe second level of Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a musical. Or, to be precise, it can be a musical. Whether or not the universe breaks into song depends on which words of the title \u201cSuper Mario Bros. Wonder\u201d you prefer.\nIf you\u2019re here for the \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d of it all, this level (and every level) can be enjoyed as a loyal continuation of the plumber\u2019s work in the 2D platformer genre that has maintained a healthy and consistent cadence since the series debuted in 1985. Dash from left to right, jump over pits, concuss enemies, collect the occasional power-up, and after a few minutes of adventuring ever eastward, leap onto the flagpole that ends one level and unlocks the next.\nPolygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it\u2019s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun \u2014 and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch .\nBut, if you\u2019re curious about the \u201cWonder\u201d \u2014 if you\u2019re not too precious about video game tradition \u2014 you can find within each Wonder stage a Wonder Seed, a Mario-sized ball of botany that morphs the environment into something indeed quite wonderful. Like a musical number.\nTo choose wonder is to flood the atmosphere with lava-lamp plasma, send gravity into convulsions, or transform your hero into any variety of creatures \u2014 or even inanimate objects. As my stoned college roommate once postulated while ripping an apple bong: \u201cYou always see the scenery, but have you ever wanted to be the scenery?\u201d Reader, he dreamt so we could live. For a moment, Mario gets to be the background.\nThe brilliance of Super Mario Bros. Wonder is that the choice is one of \u201cand,\u201d not of \u201cor.\u201d The traditional and the topsy-turvy coexist. Across six worlds, the creators of Wonder offer a menu of familiar stages that, should you like, can be prepared with extra spice \u2014 or paired with the family-friendly equivalent of ayahuasca. That particular drug comparison isn\u2019t flippant: At one point Toad licks the ol\u2019 Wonder Seed, and suddenly he\u2019s riding a dragon.\nWonder Seeds can add a splash of difficulty, but help is perpetually available in a fashion that\u2019s considerate rather than patronizing. Gone are time limits. Extra lives can be purchased at a low cost with the game\u2019s abundant purple currency. A new badge system allows players to select from a growing collection of special abilities that range from helpful (a high, floating leap) to playful (a Piranha Plant grappling hook) to silly (a triple jump tied to a musical rhythm).\nPrince charming Badges are worn by a little royal bug named Prince Florian who joins you on your journey and provides the majority of conversation on this road trip, alongside very talkative flowers sprouting across every corner of the Flower Kingdom, eager to provide a tip for a metatextual wink.\nEach unlockable upgrade or special move is assigned to a badge that can be found or purchased. One collected badge can be selected before each stage, so I found myself rotating abilities based on need. For example, when later stages added a bunch of instant-death bottomless pits, I opted for the Safety Bounce badge: When I plunge into an abyss, the darkness spits me up like a piece of hamburger caught in its throat.\nI expect many players will brag that their favorite badge is the \u201coverpowered one,\u201d which is sort of always true. No matter what you use, you will feel like you\u2019ve been given an unfair advantage as you casually float over chunks of the stage or vacuum coins through walls. To maintain balance, the designers layered on new challenges, keeping Wonder within the Goldilocks window. Not too hard, not too easy. Just right.\nThe wonder of playing Super Mario Bros. in 1985 came from the discovery. Nintendo not only predicted players would climb outside the confines of the level, it placed shortcuts in the hidden crevices to reward the most rule-breaking players. Badges cleverly build upon that sense of freedom with skills that let you soar over towering enemies or use that Piranha Plant grappling hook to climb high above the confines of the stage \u2014 now a Mario tradition.\nAnd sometimes Wonder goes further. With Wonder Seeds, the levels themselves collapse and contort, disobeying the laws established by decades of Mario games. Giant, sudsy, rainbow-tinted bubbles fill a stage and burst through the ceiling; a colossal snowball knocks down a flagpole, extending the stage beyond its official conclusion.\nThis is the most significant difference between 1985 and 2023: Mario\u2019s creators have joined in the fun of breaking the machine.\nPlay Mario for the first time a second time\nMiddle-aged Mario fans (read: me) have speculated since its announcement that Wonder could be the first \u201ctrue new Mario game\u201d since Super Mario World in 1990.\nTo younger (or just less obsessive) readers, that theory might sound strange. Nintendo has released many iterative entries of Mario \u2014 including the cheekily named New Super Mario Bros. series. However, for the village elders, the first four 2D Mario games stand apart.\nMario multiplayer Wonder shines as a solo experience, but like other recent 2D Mario games, Wonder allows up to four players to play together. Multiplayer is both a delight and utter chaos. The humanoid characters (Mario, Peach, Toad, etc.) are like M&Ms \u2014 they have different exteriors but effectively play the same. The critters are perfect for players who prefer a little extra help. Nabbit and Yoshi won\u2019t take damage, and the Yoshis have their familiar tongue attack and floaty jump.\nWith each Super Mario Bros. on the NES and SNES, Nintendo\u2019s designers learned from the previous entry, cutting what didn\u2019t work, making audacious additions (there was a time when adding a dinosaur named Yoshi felt like a gimmick!), and gradually accumulating the pieces and tropes that would appear in every game for the following 30-plus years.\nThen, with Super Mario 64, 3D Mario games became the de facto labs for Nintendo\u2019s greatest experimentation: Magical hats! Water guns! Galactic travel! 2D Mario, conversely, defaulted to a vessel for nostalgia.\nI can say with confidence that Wonder shares those early games\u2019 inventiveness, and their disregard for what should and shouldn\u2019t be in a Mario game. When playing Wonder, I\u2019ve imagined how it came to be: In my fantasy, since the \u201990s, every time a Nintendo developer had an idea that \u201cdidn\u2019t fit the tone\u201d or \u201cwasn\u2019t Mario enough,\u201d they wrote it into a notebook. And eventually, with no space left, someone had the gall to say, \u201cLet\u2019s turn this stuffed notebook of chaos into a game. Because why shouldn\u2019t Mario be an elephant? Why shouldn\u2019t Wigglers wear roller skates? And why shouldn\u2019t Luigi skydive?\u201d\nWonder\u2019s creators have so many new ideas to share that their creativity is unapologetically wasteful, which I say as a compliment. Many gimmicks in Super Mario Bros. Wonder could be stretched to fill entire games, but here, we\u2019re lucky to see them last a few minutes.\nFor example, one stage might feature platforms that drop when you step on them. The next stage will feature platforms that drop, but only after you\u2019ve jumped on them a certain number of times \u2014 a countdown clock at their center. After that, the stage will have platforms made of batteries, each dropping as it runs out of energy. And then, to wrap things up, there will be a stage in which you build the stage out of huge batteries of different shapes, the platform rapidly growing and shrinking as it skims above a yawning abyss.\nIn the current era of AAA \u201cforever games\u201d filled with endless lists of chores and artificial rewards, Wonder\u2019s willingness to juice each idea of its fun, then toss the rind in the trash, is a potent alternative. The reward isn\u2019t XP or limited-edition outfits. It\u2019s the play itself.\nDon\u2019t mistake the creative abundance (and refusal to wear out one\u2019s welcome) for a short game. Levels are everywhere. Wonder\u2019s map features six worlds, but levels can also be found in the hub area, along with... to avoid spoilers, let\u2019s just say elsewhere. The familiar rhythms of a Mario game have been broken, with bosses appearing without warning, some worlds ending with no boss fight at all, and the occasional surprise stage that materializes like a mirage.\nWhether or not Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the unofficial Super Mario Bros. 5 that dorks like me have long wanted, I\u2019ll leave to the forums. But I will say this: What a joy it is to play a Mario game and not already know how to read it, to not have my muscle memory do more work than my brain.\nWith rumors that the Nintendo Switch\u2019s successor could arrive early next year, I would be fine if Wonder were this console\u2019s last big release. To survive after the Wii U, Nintendo had to bring together its console and handheld designers and create something unlike anything on the market, without sacrificing what had gotten the company to that point. As the sun sets on the Switch, after an unprecedented run of success, along with arguably the best entries in many of the company\u2019s biggest franchises, we get Super Mario Bros. Wonder.\nLike the Switch itself, Wonder is a collision between the traditional and the new. A game that\u2019s the same as it ever was and nothing like Mario has ever been.\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder will be released Oct. 20 on Nintendo Switch. The game was reviewed on Nintendo Switch using a pre-release download code provided by Nintendo. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

Also, a lot of people who are very cranky with Mint, and trust me, I feel you on that.\nOne note before we get into it: you should, of course, be careful about where you manage your money and financial information and to whom you give access to any of that data. Many of the apps we\u2019re about to talk about are popular and highly regarded, but you should always be cautious with this stuff. My credit score also once got dinged because I had signed up for too many personal finance apps \u2014 true story \u2014 so there are lots of reasons to be thoughtful here.\nCool? Cool. Let\u2019s run through some of your ideas and findings:\nYNAB is the big winner. YNAB, which stands for You Need A Budget, was the overwhelming most popular recommendation I got this week. Folks liked that you can sync all your accounts and cards, that it\u2019s an independent app you pay for instead of being bombarded by ads and credit card deals, and that it has a specific set of principles and systems you can just pick up and start using.\nYNAB, which stands for You Need A Budget, was the overwhelming most popular recommendation I got this week.

Copilot is the other go-to. Copilot is much more polished than YNAB, and people love the app\u2019s design, its dataviz tools, and just how easy it is to interact with. It\u2019s only for iOS and Mac, which is unfortunate, but as finance apps go, it seems to be unbeatably fun to use.\nCopilot is much more polished than YNAB, and people love the app\u2019s design, its dataviz tools, and just how easy it is to interact with.

Don\u2019t sleep on spreadsheets.

Or maybe just use your bank. A lot of banks now offer budget tools from right within your banking app, so you can manage your money right next to where it lives. (I hear good things about SoFi\u2019s features on this front.) If you do most or all of your banking in one place, a few folks said this is the way.\nPersonally, after reading all your notes and doing some research, I\u2019m going to give Copilot a run. I\u2019ve tried YNAB in the past, and it\u2019s great, but I just did a bad job keeping up with it. I\u2019m also going to make an epic 2024 budget spreadsheet and see how far that gets me.\nScreen share\nKevin Nguyen, a deputy editor at The Verge, warned me when I first asked him to do this that he had four different writing apps on his homescreen. To which I said: sold, bring it on, we love an obsessive homescreen setup.\nThen Kevin followed up and said, \u201cOh, sorry, it\u2019s actually five writing apps.\u201d Kevin gets it. Here\u2019s Kevin\u2019s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:\nThe phone: iPhone 15 Pro (already lightly scratched my screen).\nThe wallpaper: My background is actually my partner, but she would be mortified if I posted a photo of her here, next to a bunch of apps, so you guys just get Toshiro Mifune.\nThe apps: Years ago, I read this interview with novelist Donna Tartt about her writing process. I assumed, as a famous person of letters, she would have an elaborate, possibly pretentious system \u2014 at least an especially fancy leather Moleskine. It turns out she just kept four different notebooks: cheap ones, sporting different Beatles album covers, each serving a different purpose. I forgot what each was for, but it was something like \u201cRevolver is for characters, Sgt. Pepper\u2019s is for plot.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know if I was channeling Tartt when I decided to regularly use a rotation of five different writing apps. They are iA Writer, Google Docs, Bear, Apple Notes, and Scrivener, and they all have more weaknesses than strengths. Each feels like it\u2019s been designed for a fairly specific use case. But that\u2019s not really the point. I know that when I open iA Writer, it\u2019s to try and get words down as quickly as possible. Docs is for revising and fidgeting. Bear is for thoughtful notes. Notes is for garbage notes (I really hate that app, but it also syncs our household grocery list). Scrivener is its own beast, built from the ground up for real sickos (authors).\nI\u2019m sure five apps that do essentially the same thing sounds like a nightmare to some people. But for me, writing and editing is a messy process, like trying to capture lightning in a bottle. Or I guess, in this case, five different bottles.\nNon-writing apps: Wallet, Google Authenticator, Photos, Camera, Google Maps, Settings, Clock, Chase, Arc (the iOS app is fairly incomplete, but it will sync with your sidebar, so I\u2019ll open a bunch of tabs, then read those links on my phone when I get on the subway), Slack, Hello Weather (my salvation since the death of Dark Sky), Pins (I use Pinboard to save longform stories, and I meticulously tag them with the kind of notes you might expect from a features editor), Letterboxd (quietly the best social app and a great way to triangulate what\u2019s out, streaming, or in theaters \u2014 if two or three friends have all logged an older film recently, it probably means it just hit Criterion or there\u2019s a revival at IFC).\nAs always, I also asked Kevin to share a few things he\u2019s into right now. Here\u2019s what he sent back:\nSurround by Hiroshi Yoshimura . This recently released ambient record was originally made to be the music of\u2026 prefab homes? But it reveals so much on closer listen: shimmering drone, swirls of pleasing synths, a touch of humor. Still, if you\u2019re lazy like I am most days, you can just put it on while you work and let it wash over you.\nThis recently released ambient record was originally made to be the music of\u2026 prefab homes?

{"title":"Meta to offer ad-free subscription in Europe in bid to keep tracking other users","context":"## Meta to offer ad-free subscription in Europe in bid to keep tracking other users\n\nMeta is to offer an ad-free subscription version of Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, EEA (European Economic Area) and Switzerland, confirming the core of a report in the WSJ earlier this month. The new ad-free subscription will be available from next month, per a Meta blog post.\nThe move follows years of privacy litigation, enforcements and court rulings in the EU \u2014 which have culminated in a situation where Meta can no longer claim a contractual right (nor legitimate interest) to track and profile users for ad targeting. (Although, at the time of writing, it is still doing the latter \u2014 meaning it is technically operating without a proper legal basis. But this summer Meta announced an intention to switch to consent.)\nUnder regional data protection law the only available basis left for Meta\u2019s tracking and profiling ad business is to obtain freely given consent from users. However the adtech giant\u2019s interpretation of free consent with this \u2018pay us or be tracked\u2019 subscription proposal will, justifiably, leave privacy advocates fuming \u2014 since the choice it\u2019s offering here boils down to \u2018pay us money; or pay us with your privacy\u2019.\nPer Meta\u2019s blog post, the fee it plans to charge users to escape its tracking and targeting (i.e. the ad-free subscription) is \u20ac9.99\/month on web or \u20ac12.99\/month on iOS or Android per linked Facebook and Instagram accounts in a user\u2019s Accounts Center. After March 1, 2024 it also says an additional fee \u2014 of \u20ac6\/month on web and \u20ac8\/month on iOS or Android \u2014 will apply for each additional account listed in a user\u2019s Account Center.\nSo the cost for using Meta\u2019s services without being tracked and profiled could quickly stack up for anyone with more than one account on Meta\u2019s social networks.\nEven for a user with just one account (on either Facebook or Instagram) the cost for protecting their privacy from Meta\u2019s tracking and profiling would be almost \u20ac120 per year (for web use) or just over \u20ac155 (on mobile).\nAs we reported earlier this month, Meta is relying on a line in a ruling handed down by the bloc\u2019s top court, the CJEU, earlier this year \u2014 where the judges allowed the possibility \u2014 caveated with \u201cif necessary\u201d \u2014 of an (another caveat) \u201cappropriate fee\u201d being charged for an equivalent alternative service (i.e. that lacks tracking and profiling). So the legal fight against Meta\u2019s continued tracking and profiling of users will hinge on what\u2019s necessary and appropriate in this context.\nnoyb, the European privacy rights group which has driven much of the strategic litigation against Meta\u2019s tracking and profiling, has already \u2014 since 2021 \u2014 been challenging similar \u2018pay or okay\u2019 practices by news publishers by filing a series of complaints with data protection authorities.\nIn a press release earlier this month after the WSJ reported Meta plans to charge users for their privacy, noyb\u2019s founder and honorary chairman, Max Schrems, wrote: \u201cThe CJEU said that the alternative to ads must be \u2018necessary\u2019 and the fee must be \u2018appropriate\u2019. I don\u2019t think \u20ac160 a year is what they had in mind. These six words are also an \u2018obiter dictum\u2019, a non-binding element that went beyond the core case before the CJEU. For Meta this is not the most stable case law and we will clearly fight against such an approach.\u201d\nContacted for a response to the development, Meta\u2019s lead regulator in the EU for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC) sent us a statement. \u201cMeta notified the DPC on July 27 of its intention to implement an alternative, consent-based model in which users would be given a choice between ads-funded versions of its platforms, and subscription versions in which, in return for payment of monthly fee, it is said that users will not receive targeted advertising,\u201d the Irish regulator wrote.\n\u201cWhile February 2024 was initially identified by Meta as the earliest date by which its consent model would be operational, it agreed to bring forward that date to November 2023 at the direction of the DPC, the DPC having been concerned to ensure that changes would be implemented to the platforms as soon as practicable in light of earlier findings to the effect that Meta had failed to demonstrate its entitlement to rely on the legal bases on which it was then relying when processing users\u2019 data for behavioural advertising purposes. These included findings made by the Court of Justice of the European Union when delivering judgment on July 4, 2023 in a case in which the Court examined the legal bases on which Meta\u2019s processing of users\u2019 data for behavioural advertising purposes is grounded.\n\u201cActing in consultation with its fellow European supervisory authorities, the DPC has been engaged in a detailed regulatory assessment of the consent-based model since it was first proposed by Meta in July. That exercise is being led by the DPC, reflecting its position as Lead Supervisory Authority for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The exercise has not yet concluded, and no findings have been made to date. It is due to be completed shortly, at which point the DPC will notify Meta if it considers that the manner in which its new user offerings are to be implemented is compatible with Meta\u2019s obligations under GDPR.\u201d\nSo Meta\u2019s move to offer users a subscription or tracking hasn\u2019t been signed off by data protection authorities as yet \u2014 and it\u2019s clear that further regulatory interventions could follow. (And on that front, Norway\u2019s DPA, which has a local ban order on Meta\u2019s tracking ads, told us it\u2019s concerned about the subscription plan, saying it has doubts as to whether it would constitute valid consent.)\nAs well as needing to comply with the GDPR, which delineates the qualities necessary for consent to be legal (such as that it is specific, informed and freely given), Meta is now also subject to the pan-EU Digital Services Act (DSA) \u2014 which also sets conditions on larger platforms when it comes to tracking and profiling people for ads. So it won\u2019t just be data protection authorities making a call on whether Meta\u2019s subscription or tracking offer flies; the European Commission is responsible for oversight of very large online platforms\u2019 DSA compliance.\nMeta has also been designated as a so-called gatekeeper, under the DSA\u2019s sister regulation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) \u2014 which also puts some limits on use of people\u2019s data for ads. The Commission is the sole enforcer of the DMA.\nMeta is already in the Commission\u2019s sights over its approach to the DSA \u2014 with the EU\u2019s executive, in recent days, requesting more information from the tech giant vis-\u00e0-vis its approach to content threats flowing from the Israel-Hamas war and about election security issues. But it remains to be seen whether the EU will apply the same close scrutiny to Meta\u2019s ad tracking offer.\nIn its blog post Meta claims the choice to offer people to pay it for their privacy or else agree to being tracked \u201cbalances the requirements of European regulators while giving users choice and allowing Meta to continue serving all people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland\u201d. But, well, it would say that.\nThe subscription is also only being offered to people aged 18 and up \u2014 which raises questions over how it will comply with requirements in the DSA and DMA not to processing children\u2019s data for ad targeting.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to explore how to provide teens with a useful and responsible ad experience given this evolving regulatory landscape,\u201d it writes on that.\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":608}
