{"title":"Shohei Ohtani rumors tracker: Latest news, updates on free agent's MLB future","context":"## Shohei Ohtani rumors tracker: Latest news, updates on free agent's MLB future\n\nThe Hot Stove dominoes have started to fall, but everyone who loves baseball \u2014 fans, players, coaches, front-office types and everyone else \u2014 is waiting for free agent Shohei Ohtani\u2019s decision. Where will the global superstar sign his next contract?\nHe\u2019s played his entire six-year MLB career with the Angels, but his teams haven\u2019t even sniffed the postseason and Ohtani\u2019s made his desire to win crystal clear, so he won\u2019t be back. Will he chase every dollar possible, going solely by the highest offer? That seems unlikely, too. Remember, Ohtani wants to win.\nLots of teams can meet Ohtani in that middle ground, offering both lots of money \u2014 he will absolutely sign the largest contract in baseball history \u2014 and lots of chances to compete for a World Series title (or two or three). It\u2019s a long list.\nMORE: Ranking 15 possible destinations for Shoehei Ohtani\nSo, the baseball world waits for news. We have been promised very little of that, though. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Passan reported this: \u201cIf visits between Ohtani and a team are reported publicly, it will be held against the team.\u201d\nSo, yeah. Probably won\u2019t hear a ton, but that won\u2019t stop the speculation. And it won\u2019t stop us from passing along what precious few nuggets that are scattered about.\nMORE: Way-too-early MLB Power Rankings for 2024\nShohei Ohtani free agent rumors and updates\nOhtani has an 'affinity' for Boston, it seems\nDate: Nov. 27\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\nHope everyone enjoyed the Thanksgiving holiday. Us baseball writers are pleased that Ohtani didn't decide to sign while the turkey was still warm. This isn't exactly \"breaking news\" because rumors have been swirling, but it's an aside from an in-the-know reporter that just might give one fan base a little too much hope and excitement.\nPassan wrote a piece about 10 teams to watch the rest of the offseason, and he threw this little note in the section about the Red Sox, and how they needed to sign Yoshinobu Yamamoto.\nBoston's bats are good, or good enough at least, to avoid having to spend like mad in a down year for free agent hitters -- unless, of course, it's for Ohtani, who has an affinity for Boston. If the Red Sox don't hit that jackpot, they're backfilled nicely with a system that includes outfielder Roman Anthony, shortstop Marcelo Mayer and catcher Kyle Teel, among the best trios of offensive prospects in baseball.\nIt's cool when the best player in the world is a free agent and has an \"affinity\" for your town.\n'Money's great, but winning's better'\nDate: Nov. 21\nSource: Max Scherzer, Rangers pitcher on Foul Territory\nOK, so this isn't necessarily a rumor, but an example of how much players would love for Ohtani to join their team. Scherzer was a guest on Foul Territory on Monday.\n\"Money's great, but winning's better.\"\n\nMax Scherzer shares his pitch for Shohei Ohtani to join the @Rangers \ud83c\udfc6\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f https:\/\/t.co\/6KoSRqSgk2 pic.twitter.com\/PHW2jHWj6C \u2014 Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 20, 2023\nMaybe Ohtani won\u2019t sign quite so soon after all\nDate: Nov. 20\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic\nBuried at the bottom of Rosenthal\u2019s piece on what an Ohtani contract might look like \u2014 incentives, opt-outs and all sorts of stuff \u2014 is this little bit of reporting:\nAn agreement at the winter meetings in Nashville the first week of December would be the ideal outcome for MLB, but not necessarily for Ohtani. He perhaps will be better off waiting for the signing of Japanese righty Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who is expected to be posted for free agency as soon as Monday, triggering a 45-day window for teams to negotiate with him. Losing out on the 25-year-old Yamamoto, who could command more than $200 million, might put certain teams on tilt, improving the landscape for Ohtani.\nInteresting, certainly.\nMariners out of the Ohtani chase?\nDate: Nov. 17\nSource: Daniel Kramer, MLB.com\nHere\u2019s the key piece of the article: \u201cIndustry sources told MLB.com this week that landing Ohtani doesn\u2019t appear to be within the Mariners\u2019 realistic agenda this offseason.\u201d\nIn a way, that\u2019s surprising. The Mariners seem to check a lot of boxes for Ohtani. They\u2019re set up to win for a long time with a bunch of young starting pitchers and a co-superstar in Julio Rodriguez. Plus, Ohtani would get to be part of the quest for the franchise\u2019s first World Series title, he\u2019d get to wear the same uniform as his baseball hero, Ichiro, and he\u2019s lived there in the offseason. So it must be about the money, and Seattle\u2019s reluctance to even get in the conversation. That\u2019s gotta be super disappointing for Mariners fans starved for a title, right?\nOn the other hand, maybe the M\u2019s know all about Ohtani\u2019s desire to keep the rumor mill quiet, and leaking \u201cnews\u201d like this would please Ohtani and his camp.\n\u2018Timing could be right for a Cubs-Ohtani union\u2019\nDate: Nov. 16\nSource: Jesse Rogers, ESPN\nThe Cubs were one of the seven finalists for Ohtani the first time around, but lack of the DH in the NL at the time made it hard for Ohtani to choose Chicago. His primary goal was showing he could both hit and pitch at a high level for an MLB team, and trying to play the outfield instead of just DHing would have been too much, even for Ohtani.\nNow, though? The NL has the DH, and the Cubs are itching to make a sport-shaking signing. Well, another sport-shaking signing. They already poached Craig Counsell from the rival Brewers to be their new manager, and it would be shocking if they didn\u2019t make a corresponding player-acquisition move. Ohtani\u2019s at the top of the list.\nOhtani could potentially sign before Winter Meetings\nDate: Nov. 11\nSource: Alden Gonzalez, ESPN\nPretty much everyone in baseball would LOVE for this to happen. The team that winds up signing him, of course, will kick the Ohtani hype machine into gear ASAP. Not only is there merchandise to sell, but the front office will use that signing to help lure other potential free agents, maybe even for a \u201cplay with Ohtani\u201d discount. But even for the other teams, knowing that Ohtani is off the board relatively soon into the offseason would allow them to shift to other priorities, like trading for Juan Soto or deciding which free-agent pitchers to pursue with the money that might have been earmarked for Ohtani.\n\nThis article, authored by Ryan Fagan, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-27 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":480}

(Photo by Sean Gardner\/Getty Images)\nRyan Blaney\u2019s recent championship victory in his Ford Mustang at the NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race was a moment of pride and celebration for Ford. However, it\u2019s not just about winning the races or championships for the manufacturer. It\u2019s about marketing and maintaining their brand loyalty, as a Ford insider reveals.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nLast Sunday, Ryan Blaney secured his first-ever championship by skillfully maneuvering his Ford Mustang to victory at Phoenix. He held off the late challenges from Chevrolet drivers Kyle Larson and William Byron. This achievement marks a significant moment for Ford and its NASCAR program, as it made a clean sweep by winning championships in Truck, Xfinity, and Cup Series.\nMark Rushbrook reveals the vehicle NASCAR fans prefer to buy from Ford\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn the post-race media conference, Mark Rushbrook, the Global Director for Ford Performance, was asked if winning the championship has any significance for the manufacturer as a whole in terms of marketing the brand globally.\nMark Rushbrook emphasized the importance of winning with the Mustang from a global marketing perspective. He stated, \u201cYeah, winning is everything for us, just as a point of pride. It\u2019s certainly going to be a celebration in Dearborn. My phone has been blowing up with Ford family members and our senior executives already so excited about it. It means a lot internally to the customer because motorsports is so important to us.\u201d\nRushbrook highlighted that success on the racetrack is the foundation of successful marketing programs. Winning races and championships builds credibility with fans and encourages them to engage with the brand. He explained, \u201cThat is the basis for successful marketing programs; it is success on the racetrack. So you have to win the races, you have to win championships to have that credibility, and for fans to engage with your brand and make them proud to have a Ford parked in their driveway or in their garage.\u201d\nWhile Ford\u2019s racing program, featuring the Mustang, certainly boosts the sale of this iconic sports car, the Ford insider dropped an interesting fact. Rushbrook revealed, \u201cFor us, NASCAR, even though we\u2019re racing a Mustang, we certainly sell Mustangs because of it. But we sell more F-150s to NASCAR fans. This is a proof point for them.\u201d\nThe Ford F-150 truck, known for its ruggedness and reliability, has garnered a dedicated following among NASCAR enthusiasts. Winning the championship is not only about showcasing the Mustang but also the Ford-150, with which Ben Rhodes won his second Truck Series championship on Friday. This is also a testament to the power of NASCAR in influencing car-buying decisions.\nFord\u2019s global marketing strategy also leverages the success of the Mustang in NASCAR, utilizing it as a marketing tool to promote their road cars worldwide. As the seventh generation Mustang continues to be sold globally as a road car, it\u2019s racing not only in NASCAR but also in various international series, including Australia Supercars, Mustang GT3, Mustang GT4, and Dark Horse R with a Spec Challenge.\nIn essence, Ford takes the benefits from any Mustang\u2019s racing success and uses it to market their cars globally. It\u2019s a win-win situation for both the brand and racing enthusiasts. Although, all this might not have come to pass were it not for a timely intervention by \u201cThe Captain.\u201d\nRoger Penske played a big part in calming Ryan Blaney down in the clutch moment of the race\nIn the heat of the championship race at Phoenix, Ryan Blaney\u2019s competitive spirit almost got the best of him. He was racing for the championship and was eager to secure the lead from Ross Chastain in the closing few laps. However, he was also aware that he needed to maintain his position to win the title.\nWatch This Story | Star Wars Saga: Bubba Wallace\u2019s Galactic Surprise for Ryan Blaney\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn the post-race conference, the Team Penske driver expressed his frustration, stating, \u201cThere is no secret that I can snap on the radio. That\u2019s been my whole life. That\u2019s been my whole career. It\u2019s just kind of something I do.\u201d He described the intense battle with Ross Chastain, who blocked him multiple times, making it a tough fight.\nThe final push came when Blaney made contact with Chastain. A move made out of frustration, as he admitted. But at this crucial moment, team owner Roger Penske, often referred to as \u201cThe Captain,\u201d stepped in. He reminded Blaney that he was not racing against Chastain but against the HMS duo. Penske\u2019s calming influence helped Blaney regain composure, ensuring that he didn\u2019t take any unnecessary risks. The result? A championship for Ryan Blaney and another testament to the guidance of \u201cThe Captain\u201d in high-pressure situations.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn NASCAR, it\u2019s not just about speed and strategy; it\u2019s also about maintaining composure under intense pressure.

However, Bedard helped set up a Ryan Donato goal in the middle frame to get the Blackhawks on the board, picking up his first NHL point in the process.\nIn the third period, Cole Guttman potted the equalizer for Chicago early in the frame. With less than five minutes left in regulation, Jason Dickinson fired home a shot from the slot that gave Chicago its first lead of the night. A Nick Foligno empty net goal sealed the deal for the Blackhawks.\nBedard was as advertised in his NHL debut. The Chicago rookie led all players on his club in shots on goal, recording five in his first game on 11 shot attempts. His 21:29 time on ice was second to only Seth Jones, as Chicago head coach Luke Richardson did not hold the 18-year-old back. He did struggle in the faceoff dot, winning just two of 13 draws, but it was a strong first impression at the NHL level.\nFor the Penguins, the third period struggles from last season have seemingly carried over to start this year. Last year, Pittsburgh finished tied for the most losses after taking a lead into the third period. The crew followed that trend on Tuesday night, letting a 2-1 lead to start the final frame slip away.\nBedard and the Blackhawks are back in action on national TV tomorrow, as Chicago heads to Boston for a Wednesday night date with the Bruins.\nMORE: Watch Blackhawks vs. Penguins live on Fubo (free trial)\nThe Sporting News provided updates and highlights from Connor Bedard's NHL debut in the Blackhawks vs. Penguins game.\nBlackhawks vs. Penguins score\n1 2 3 F Blackhawks 0 1 3 4 Penguins 1 1 0 2\nBlackhawks vs. Penguins live updates, highlights from Connor Bedard's NHL debut\nAll times Eastern\nFinal: Blackhawks 4, Penguins 2\n10:50 p.m. \u2014 The Blackhawks score four unanswered goals to come from behind and take down the Penguins on opening night.

{"title":"Ole Miss vs. Georgia live score, updates, highlights from Week 11 college football game","context":"## Ole Miss vs. Georgia live score, updates, highlights from Week 11 college football game\n\nThe SEC East champs put on a show, to say the least. Georgia dominated against ninth-ranked Ole Miss, coming up with a 52-17 win to earn a date with Alabama in the SEC Championship Game in December. All-American tight end Brock Bowers returned to the field for his final homestead only 26 days after TightRope surgery. Starting against the Rebels, he had three catches for 34 yards, adding a touchdown in the fourth quarter. He missed just two games after suffering the high ankle sprain against Vanderbilt on Oct. 14. Georgia didn't need him, though, as the running backs had themselves a night for both teams. Kendall Milton and Daijun Edwards scored two touchdowns each as the Bulldogs finished with 300 rushing yards. Milton ended the night with a career-high 127 yards. For Ole Miss, Quinshon Judkins scored the only two touchdowns and finished with 75 yards. Unfortunately for Rebels, injury continues to plague them after Micah Pettus, the team's top lineman, was ruled out with a broken foot bone he sustained during practice. Quarterback Jaxson Dart left the game at the end of the third quarter after a hit from two Georgia defenders. He held his collarbone as he entered the injury tent. He was taken back to the locker room for further examination and did not return to the game, leaving it in the hands of Spencer Sanders. Before his exit, Dart passed for 112 yards and one interception. Sanders finished it up with 61 yards on four completions. For the Dawgs, Carson Beck finished with 306 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. It's the fourth game this season with over 300 yards and at least two touchdowns. In its trip to the SEC Championship for the third-straight year, Georgia will face Alabama, who it lost to in 2021. A dominant win over the Rebels surely inspires some confidence with two regular season games left.

Interest-rate sensitive sectors, including REITS and consumer companies, were among the weakest on the local bourse as investors digested the news.\nGSFM investment strategist Stephen Miller said the inflation data, taken with the October Reserve Bank board meeting minutes, which revealed the board had \u201clow tolerance for a slower return of inflation to target than currently expected\u201d, made the possibility of an interest rate rise from the central bank in November a \u201cnear certainty\u201d.

{"title":"Israel thwarts Hamas on the financial battlefield","context":"## Israel thwarts Hamas on the financial battlefield\n\nTwo weeks into the war, the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA) received secret intelligence information from two European countries that warned: \"A large, well-known organization is raising funds for Hamas through posts on social networks, and fintech company platforms outside Israel, under the guise of donations to Gaza residents.\" The information included the name of the organization, its fundraising methods, and the identity of the entities behind it. Their concern was that, within days, the millions of dollars raised would go directly to the military arm of Hamas. In a swift joint international action, at IMPA\u2019s request, one of the European countries blocked the organization\u2019s money pipeline by immediately freezing its financial activities.\n\"We are talking about a matter of minutes here. From the moment the authorities in Europe received the information, and we requested the money be blocked, with no court orders or delay, they blocked the transfer of millions of dollars to one of the most active organizations, and from it to Hamas. This is a real-time deterrence,\" reveals IMPA director general Adv. Ilit Ostrovitch-Levi. \"And then there was a domino effect. Following this blocking, more countries began to look around, and blocked funds intended for terror. All this information, which is now shared at an international level, leads to the closing of more and more Hamas funding pipelines, in real time. With worldwide cooperation, Israel\u2019s security and enforcement authorities are thwarting the transfer of millions of dollars earmarked for terrorism, every day.\"\nHeaded by Ostrovitch-Levi since May 2022, IMPA is an intelligence body that conducts the most complex of international economic investigations, and fights terror financing routinely. On October 7, Ostrovitch-Levi received a painful reminder of the vital importance of her work. \"Already on that Saturday night, with Israeli under heavy rocket fire, we talked about preparing ourselves for the campaign we\u2019re now entering, the fight against terror financing channels. Dozens of our staff have been called up to reserve duty, in large part managers working regularly in the fight against terror financing.\"\nSince then, most of IMPA\u2019s work has focused on identifying and blocking the terror money pipelines. \"We work very reactively - we see a fundraising campaign, try to deter it, and stop it from happening again. There are no breaks, because they are constantly active. It\u2019s a daily struggle. Our analysts have been sitting on the social networks from day two of the war, just manually monitoring visible sources of information on these networks to locate fundraising campaigns for terrorist organizations operating in Gaza.\"\nThree days after the war began, IMPA also issued a call to all global regulated entities for increased vigilance towards terrorism financing campaigns in response to the ongoing war and state of emergency, and to report all activities that raise suspicion of terror support and terror financing, in an effective and immediate manner.\nRELATED ARTICLES Tech experts battle to shut down Gaza financial pipeline\n\"Overnight, we started receiving hundreds of reports about unusual activity by customers of financial institutions in the State of Israel,\" she says. Before October 7, IMPA received about 100 reports a day dealing with terror financing. That number jumped to about 1,000. \"There is a 900% increase in reports on terror financing, and we don't waste time, everything happens very, very quickly. As we receive the information, we simultaneously pass it on to the operational professionals who locate the money pipelines, and block them. Some information will not necessarily lead to terror financing, but we don\u2019t have time to waste. Bank CEOs call and draw our attention to the information they convey to us that warrants special attention.\"\nHas information from banks and financial institutions led to blocking the money pipeline for terrorism?\n\"There was very high-quality intelligence that we passed on to the security agencies. We don't always know the results.\"\n\"Gaza could be more beautiful than Dubai \"\nThe network to block terror financing funds includes many entities, including private citizens. \"The world's financial intelligence authorities are now at the heart of this struggle, and we\u2019re working together to thwart the financing channels that we\u2019ve located. In addition, we\u2019ve been approached by many experts from the private sector; people with intelligence experience because they\u2019ve worked in these organizations, or have high-tech experience, and have mobilized like crazy. Israeli entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley have contacted us; they write code, search for information, and give us lots of information. We aggregate and examine everything.\"\nIMPA is charged with rooting out the sources of funding for terrorism, working together with the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel (NBCTF) in the Ministry of Defense, which is the coordinating body of all activities to thwart terror financing, the Shin Bet, Military Intelligence Directorate (AMAN), and all other relevant intelligence and security agencies. \"The most significant way to finance terrorism is to finance countries, not fundraising campaigns. These have intensified greatly over the last month, but the core of the budget - for Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad is Iran, in particular the Quds Force (the special forces of the IRGC, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). Hamas has all kinds of additional sources of self-financing, including businesses, associations, investments, and all kinds of arrangements they\u2019ve tried to set up over the years. They need state funding, and without Iran they have no ability to exist.\"\nHow much money does Iran transfer to Hamas?\n\"As far as we know, the budget from Iran to Gaza is in the order of $100 million a year. Gaza could do very nice things with this money, make it even more beautiful than Dubai. But from what we know, most of this budget goes to the military wing of Hamas.\"\nQatar also transfers money to Hamas.\n\"Qatar transferred suitcases of cash to Gaza through Israel. Everyone knows this. This money allegedly went to pay salaries and civilian needs (education, health, infrastructure), and therefore Israel transferred it, so it\u2019s incorrect to say that it all went to fund terrorism.\"\nFrom money-changers to chocolate\nHow have these billions reached the Gaza street, and Hamas over the years? There are quite a few methods, including cryptocurrencies and trade. But the main and easiest method for money transfer to Gaza is hawala.\nOstrovitch-Levi explains, \"Most of the money does not reach Gaza physically through the border crossings, but via hawala, a financial channel that is based on trust and connections, and enables the transfer and exchange of funds between countries, without the cash physically passing through them. It\u2019s a channel for transferring the funds raised in other countries. In Gaza there are all sorts of wealthy individuals who can transfer large amounts in cash to Hamas upon receiving request from entities abroad.\"\nHow does the method work?\n\"Money changers in places all over the world, let's say Turkey, receive money, and inform the hawaladars (money changers) in Gaza who transfer the money on their behalf. When a customer comes to a hawaladar in Turkey and asks to transfer money to Gaza, he does not physically transfer money, but settles accounts internally with money changers in Gaza, and Judea and Samaria. The funds are de facto not transferred. Occasionally, or when the amount of the debt reaches a predetermined ceiling, a transfer is made between the money changers to reset the outstanding debt.\"\nIs it possible detect the money pipeline between hawaladars and halt the transfer?\n\"Transfers are made between two \u2018exchangers,\u2019 and don\u2019t include the identity of the beneficiaries, or the persons who gave the money. They don\u2019t know what the transactions were, they only know there are debts to offset. We are in a constant battle against this phenomenon. In recent years, Israeli authorities have designated several currency service providers in Gaza as conduits facilitating the transfer tens of millions of dollars a year to terrorist organizations in Gaza.\"\nAnother way to transfer money is trade. Transferring goods, or inflating their value. For example, only days ago, containers of goods worth hundreds of thousands of shekels were seized at Ashdod Port, which were destined for Hamas merchants in Nablus and other cities, with the proceeds intended to go on to finance Hamas operations. Another example is the 23 tons of chocolate bars that were seized in August 2021 in a joint operation by the NBCTF, AMAN, and the Tax Authority at the Nitzana Border Crossing between Israel and Egypt. It was suspected that the snack bars, destined for Gaza, were purchased with terror financing funds, with the proceeds from their sales earmarked for Hamas.\nAnother affair that was uncovered, combined trade and hawala. Hamas funds originating in Iran, which were transferred in cash to money changers in Turkey for transfer to Gaza. At the same time Hamed al-Khachari, a Gazan money changer who worked for Hamas (who was assassinated by Israel in 2019), located Gazan merchants who imported goods from Turkish companies and owned payment on the goods. They paid cash to Khachari, who transferred the money to Hamas in Gaza. Meanwhile, the money changers in Turkey received funds from Hamas abroad that were used to pay the Turkish companies.\nHamas is already preparing for \"the day after\"\nAlthough it has been almost impossible to transfer money and goods to Gaza since October 7, with hawala shuttered, and no trade, Hamas continues to raise funds. \"The situation in Gaza is known, and nothing can be brought in, but fundraising activity continues in Judea and Samaria. It\u2019s also possible to make bank transfers to Judea and Samaria, and the fundraising activity hasn't stopped, because while the fighting is going on, they\u2019re continuing to fill their reserves for \u2018the day after\u2019 [the war]. We realize they\u2019re raising funds for their continued operations. Hamas is taking advantage of the current sympathy for the Gazans\u2019 situation, and is using online platforms, both of organizations whose business is crowdfunding, and also through the creation of fictitious projects to raise funds: throw-pillows, jewelry and whatnot, and more.\"\nAll this happens openly, for all to see, in Europe, and other places around the world. \"Hamas and Islamic Jihad carry out recruitment operations under the guise of humanitarian aid campaigns, and use Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok to disseminate their announcements. The facade is always supporting humanitarian goals, but in practice it's about channels for funding individuals and entities connected directly to Hamas or Islamic Jihad.\"\nHowever, IMPA\u2019s goal, Ostrovitch-Levi explains, is not only to stop the individual raising of funds for terror financing, but the entire interrelated chain, from the fund-raiser to the transferrer, and on through to the recipient. \"We have the ability to build the intelligence scenario, synchronize all the sources of information received, and delineate the money trail from abroad to Hamas. We\u2019re interested not only in who is running the campaign, the association or entity, but where the money is coming from, and where it\u2019s going. We need to stop all of the elements in this network.\"\nEver since October 7, everyone has been discussing and analyzing the question of about the intelligence agencies, and why there was no warning. Where was IMPA before?\n\"Hamas collects lots of money all the time, and the security agencies deter money transfers. There was no sudden increase in the raising of billions, and you must also remember that most of the money is raised globally, not in Israel. The hundreds of millions of dollars that Hamas receives have been accumulating for years. We had no possibility of seeing a spike in fundraising towards October 7.\"\n\"We understand the west is next\"\nIMPA is not alone in the fight against terror financing. Three days after the start of the war, Andrea Gacki, Director of the US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) contacted Ostrovitch-Levi to request a meeting. The two met at virtually the same time President Joe Biden met with the families of the hostages. \"She put herself and the entity she heads, one of the most powerful financial intelligence agencies in the world, at our disposal. She said, 'Whatever you want or need, just say the word'\".\nGacki has kept her promise. \"Since that day, we\u2019ve received an unprecedented flow of financial intelligence from the US, unlike anything seen before. They\u2019ve given us valuable information that we\u2019ve passed on to the security agencies, about organizations they didn\u2019t necessarily know about, and people backing them, all in real time. At the same time, they\u2019ve issued alerts to increase vigilance among the US public about terror financing.\"\nOn October 18, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that it had imposed sanctions on 10 key Hamas operatives and financial facilitators in Gaza and elsewhere including Sudan, Turkey, Algeria, and Qatar. The statement read, \"This action targets members managing assets in a secret Hamas investment portfolio, a Qatar-based financial facilitator with close ties to the Iranian regime, a key Hamas commander, and a Gaza-based virtual currency exchange and its operator\u2026 To date, the Treasury has targeted nearly 1,000 individuals and entities connected to terrorism and terrorist financing by the Iranian regime and its proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iran-aligned terrorist groups in the region.\"\nOn October 27, OFAC imposed a second round of sanctions on key Hamas-linked officials and financial networks. The statement read, \"Today\u2019s action targets additional assets in Hamas\u2019s investment portfolio and individuals who are facilitating sanctions evasion by Hamas-affiliated companies. The Treasury is also designating a Hamas official in Iran and members of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), as well as a Gaza-based entity that has served as a conduit for illicit Iranian funds to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).\"\nThe US is not the only one. Europe has also been mobilized in the economic fight against terrorism. \"On the third day of the fighting, my colleagues from the Netherlands and Germany, both veteran heads of their authorities for the prohibition of money laundering, phoned to let me know they wanted to establish an international task force to assist Israel in the fight against the financing of Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, and all terrorist organizations and their satellites. With them and with the US, we established a kind of task force, which is not subject to any country or unifying body, countries that are working in coordination, and meet every few days to exchange intelligence, and advance the struggle.\"\nIn general, following an appeal by IMPA to its counterparts around the world, there has been a dramatic increase in intelligence coming to Israel from abroad. \"The amount of information doubled in the month of fighting, compared with the monthly average. Before the war, we received about 24 intelligence reports a month from parallel authorities, compared with 50 today.\"\nCountries around the world cooperating with Israel to fight terrorism sounds almost ideal, but it\u2019s hard not to wonder where they were before.\n\"Many countries felt this had nothing to do with them, that it wasn\u2019t their struggle. The international and US mobilization, the task force we founded, the fact that the financial sector abroad suddenly wants to accept the Israeli announcements about the terror entities and people involved, receive intelligence from Israel, and cooperate with us is all only because of October 7. Everyone understands that \u2018The West is next\u2019 isn\u2019t an empty statement. This event is the one to make the countries of the world understand they must fight effectively against terror financing, that they need to block Iran effectively.\"\nIMPA is trying to convey these messages to the member nations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international body to combat money laundering and terror financing. \"We are working very hard on isolating Iran in matters of terror financing. But it\u2019s still a cash economy and it is very, very difficult to stop the financing of Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad. Most of the money comes from oil, but there\u2019s actually an Iranian security system budget dedicated to this.\"\nAnother problem to be dealt with is the addiction to the cash received from the terrorist organizations. \"Because it involves cash in such huge amounts, a situation has arisen in which the populations in Gaza and Lebanon become addicted to financing from Iran. There is internal collapse and a complete disruption of the ability to receive funds another way. This makes terrorism a very profitable business. It destroys the civic structure, unemployment rates rise very high, and being a Hamas operator becomes profitable. It's a vicious circle that feeds on itself. This is an alternative banking system disconnected from the general system. The Iranians are building whole mechanisms to enable intake of this money. This is something bigger than deterring one transfer or another.\"\nCan the current global mobilization alter the fight against terror financing?\n\"Discussions with countries around the world and immediate deterrence are not long-term solutions. Stopping the funds from Iran should be carried out at the international level through FATF, through OFAC sanctions, through sanctions from the entire world. In the end, the solution to Iranian financing are global sanctions. It\u2019s not something that one country can prevent. The bottom line is that without money there is no terrorism, and no matter how hard they try to decapitate the terrorist organizations, as long as they have economic oxygen, as long as the countries of the world do not fight terror financing properly, these organizations will continue to breathe.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on November 19, 2023.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023.\n\nThis article, authored by Ela Levi-Weinrib, was published by Globes English | Israel Business Arena on 2023-11-19 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":486}
{"title":"NASCAR offseason news roundup: Short track testing in Phoenix, new spotters for stars, more moves for 2024","context":"## NASCAR offseason news roundup: Short track testing in Phoenix, new spotters for stars, more moves for 2024\n\nEvery year, the wintertime and the NASCAR offseason is a welcome -- but very short -- respite from what is otherwise a demanding, year-long grind of racing. Come 2024, that grind is soon to begin again, and exactly what it looks like will be based in large part on these months where driver lineups, crew lineups and rules packages are set.\nWith much activity going on within the confines of race shops across NASCAR, here are some major storylines for the week of Dec. 4 as the offseason continues.\nOffseason testing in Phoenix\nOne month after Ryan Blaney was crowned the Cup Series champion and the 2023 season was completed out west, Blaney and a select group of other drivers and teams returned to Phoenix Raceway for a two-day test as NASCAR looked at a number of aerodynamic and technical changes for the Next Gen car. Blaney was one of six drivers to participate in the test, joining Chris Buescher, Erik Jones, Christopher Bell, Kyle Larson and Corey LaJoie.\nThe first day of testing centered around different splitters and diffusers as well as tires engineered to degrade more during green flag runs as NASCAR tries to build upon marginal improvements made to the Next Gen car's short track package in 2023. According to Cole Cusumano, teams ran a simplified diffuser -- featuring just two fins in the middle at a 90-degree angle -- as well as an alternate splitter design.\nAfter ascertaining a direction on aerodynamics and tires, NASCAR spent the second day of the test experimenting with existing mufflers to slightly soften the otherwise deafening noise made by Cup Series motors. Gearbox and shifting changes were not included as part of this test.\nSpeaking to reporters, Blaney noted the biggest difference came in the alternate splitter, which significantly reduced downforce.\n\"It was big. The first laps I had I was like, 'Man, this thing drives way different,'\" Blaney said. \"... It's a massive aero loss when you do that. And then the simple diffuser wasn't as big of a change as the splitter, but it was still something to feel.\"\nThe topic of mufflers -- while anathema to the purest of gearheads -- has been one that has occasionally popped up in the Next Gen era, particularly with NASCAR now using mufflers in urban settings at stadiums (Los Angeles Coliseum) and on street courses (Chicago) where noise ordinances are more of a consideration. Kyle Larson told reporters he did not notice a difference in cockpit cooling with the mufflers tested on Wednesday, but spoke positively of the idea overall.\n\"I definitely think our racecars are way too loud, and probably are still too loud with the mufflers,\" Larson said. \"I think the cars can be quieter just to help the fan experience.\"\nNotable crew changes\nNot one, but two of the biggest stars in NASCAR will have new eyes in the sky in 2024, as the spotters for both Chase Elliott and Ryan Blaney announced they will be stepping down. Eddie D'Hondt announced Saturday he would not return as Elliott's spotter next season, followed Monday by Josh Williams announcing he would step down as Blaney's spotter.\nAccording to Bob Pockrass of Fox Sports, former NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Tim Fedewa, the longtime spotter for Kevin Harvick, will take over as the spotter for Blaney next season. A possible landing spot for Williams exists at Spire Motorsports, as Williams has previously spotted for Zane Smith in the Craftsman Truck Series.\nSpire Motorsports announced a number of personnel moves this week, hiring Stephen Doran as the crew chief for Smith's No. 71 Chevrolet and Luke Lambert as the crew chief of the No. 77 for Carson Hocevar. Doran joins Spire from Stewart-Haas Racing, where he was an engineer on the No. 4 team, while Lambert moves to Spire after being crew chief of the No. 42 at Legacy Motor Club in 2023.\nIn addition, Spire has also hired Doug Duchardt, whose career in racing has included stints at General Motors and Chip Ganassi Racing, as its new team president.\nDrivers on the move\n\nUnbeknownst to most at last Sunday's Washington Commanders game, many in NASCAR became aware of a part of Joe Gibbs Racing's 2024 plans in the Xfinity Series and the apparent hiring of a Cup veteran. While serving as a guest of the team, Joe Gibbs was seen introducing Aric Almirola to Commanders owner Josh Harris, with lip readers online ascertaining that Gibbs appeared to tell Harris that Almirola is now driving for them.\nAccording to Bob Pockrass, the expectation is that Almirola will drive part-time for Joe Gibbs Racing -- where he began his NASCAR career in the 2000s -- in the Xfinity Series, joining a driver lineup that will also include Chandler Smith and Sheldon Creed. Such would align with the expectations for Almirola's racing future, as he had entertained continuing to race part-time when it was announced he would not return to Stewart-Haas Racing in 2024.\nThe matter of Almirola's replacement in the SHR No. 10 has been a rather poorly-kept secret: It is widely expected the team will hire Noah Gragson as its new driver as Gragson looks to reclaim his standing as a bright young star following a disastrous rookie year in Cup with Legacy Motor Club. Gragson was recently spotted at Stewart-Haas Racing's shop, and he also drove a Ford in this past weekend's Snowball Derby with Rette Jones Racing.\nGragson did not let on to any 2024 plans in a recent conversation with Matt Weaver of Sportsnaut, instead choosing to discuss his regrets and personal growth from the end of his rookie season. Gragson resigned as the driver of the No. 42 in August while serving a month-long suspension after he was spotted having liked a racially insensitive meme on his Instagram account.\n\"There have been some challenges this year, but I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world,\" Gragson said. \"I don't know that I would change anything that has happened because I have learned from it and it gives me a chance to be a better person.\n\"In life, you either win or you learn, on and off the racetrack. The wins have been great, but you learn through the hardships and defeats. I am grateful to have good people around me, and I'm working really hard every day to hopefully get a second chance and to make the most of it.\"\nWhile the Stewart-Haas No. 10 seat is seemingly filled, some intrigue still exists as to exactly who will drive the No. 16 for Kaulig Racing next season. After running the car full-time in 2023, it was announced Thursday that A.J. Allmendinger would go back to full-time Xfinity Series racing for Kaulig in 2024, though he will continue to run a partial Cup schedule.\nThe assumption of many had been that the No. 16 would be taken over by Ty Dillon, but that assumption may have been premature. Weaver shared in a recent thread on X that information suggesting Dillon had been hired to drive the No. 16 was \"incorrect,\" casting ambiguity on both who will join Daniel Hemric at Kaulig next season as well as the exact plans of Dillon, who has bounced from team to team since Germain Racing shut down following the 2020 season.\nNuts and Bolts\n\nThis article, authored by Steven Taranto, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-12-07 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":487}
{"title":"Spill toasts one year with a 2.7M seed extension, Kerry Washington and champagne","context":"## Spill toasts one year with a 2.7M seed extension, Kerry Washington and champagne\n\nAt midnight last Friday, Alphonzo Terrell held up a glass of Dom P\u00e9rignon and toasted his one-year anniversary of being laid off at Twitter.\nIf it weren\u2019t for that moment, he wouldn\u2019t be in Austin at an AfroTech after-party, surrounded by thousands of people who now know his name and his social media app, Spill. As a competitor to the platform now known as X, Spill hails itself as a safer place for Black Americans and the LGBTQ community and has amassed around 200,000 users, he said. This past year, the app, which is still in beta mode, has raised a total of $5 million in pre-seed funding, including a recent $2 million extension round led by Collide Capital.\n\u201cWe put an invite-only beta in June, and within three weeks, it went viral,\u201d Terrell told TechCrunch. \u201cSuddenly, we\u2019re supporting a city, we have data costs, we have infrastructure, we have to accelerate our building times, so we really needed an extension to do that effectively.\u201d\nHis journey with Spill started last year at AfroTech. He arrived at the conference just days after being laid off from what was then Twitter, along with about 3,000 others amid Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition. Terrell hopped on a call with former Twitter colleague DeVaris Brown about a business idea and spent three days in an Airbnb creating the pitch deck for what became Spill. At AfroTech, he went around taking last-minute coffee meetings, seeing who would give his company a chance. Flash-forward to this year and Spill is the cool kid in town.\nSo many apps have sprung up over the last year in an attempt to become \u201cthe new Twitter,\u201d but no app has emerged as the dominant refuge for disillusioned Twitter users. Threads, Instagram\u2019s supposed \u201cTwitter killer,\u201d got 100 million sign-ups within five days; the decentralized platform Mastodon has 1.8 million monthly active users; and the smaller upstart Bluesky hit 1 million users in September. Though still in beta, Spill\u2019s community of 200,000 users may seem small in comparison, but Spill\u2019s rise has shown that quality matters just as much as quantity \u2014 that building a strong core community is just as valuable as high-speed growth, even if the traditional venture model may not always incentivize thoughtful product development.\n\u201cIf you have a great experience, you\u2019re going to grow,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cEspecially in a world where you have so many networks \u2014 there are all these choices that people conceivably have \u2014 you\u2019re gonna go to the one where you have the greatest experience and want to invest your time.\u201d\nAnother app that spun out from laid-off former Twitter employees, Pebble (formerly T2), recently shut down after a year, growing to just 20,000 registered users. Its CEO, Gabor Cselle, previously had exits to Google and Twitter, but accepted that Pebble simply wasn\u2019t competitive enough to stay afloat. But while Pebble sought to essentially clone Twitter, Spill\u2019s team is building something that looks very little like it.\n\u201cPeople are looking for something new,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cI think things that have really defined, unique value propositions are going to win over the long term \u2014 it might not be like there\u2019s one winner-take-all.\u201d\nEarlier this year, TechCrunch covered the founding of Spill, piquing the interest of Kapor Capital, which ended up writing the company its first check.\n\u201cWe had over 25,000 people join our waiting list in less than 24 hours from that article,\u201d Terrell said.\nThis weekend, as CEO, Terrell took the AfroTech stage twice: once to interview Mitch and Freida Kapor, the founders of Kapor Capital, and a second to reveal a new app feature: Tea Party, which is similar to Instagram Live. The first user to host a Tea Party was actress Kerry Washington. Terrell\u2019s next dream Tea Party host? Keke Palmer, who is already on Spill. So are other cultural icons like Questlove, Ava DuVernay and Janelle Mon\u00e1e.\n\u201cTea Parties reflect the communities that we have always spoken very clearly that we are here to center,\u201d Kenya Parham, Spill\u2019s Global VP of Community and Partnerships, told TechCrunch. \u201cBlack communities, queer communities, women, non-binary and femme stories are all the way at the forefront, and the community is just eating it up.\u201d\nAnne Griffin can attest to that. She\u2019s a product manager based in New York and signed up for Bluesky, Spill and Threads last year. Out of those three, Spill is the only one she is still consistently using. \u201cIt feels much more rooted in authentic connection,\u201d she told us about the app, praising its product features. \u201cIn a world where many social media algorithms focus on engagement at any cost, it\u2019s refreshing to have an app that is focused on engagement around community in culture.\u201d\nWashington, meanwhile, joined the platform organically; Spill has \u201cnot paid for a single acquisition to date,\u201d Parham said, which speaks to the influence and respect that the app\u2019s leadership has established in the entertainment and tech industries. Before Spill, Terrell led marketing teams at HBO and Showtime; Parham ran her own strategic communications consultancy, working with a laundry list of major production studios. So, already, Spill has wooed advertising partners like Netflix, Lionsgate, VH1, Showtime and Sony Pictures.\nSpill has come to be a bright spot in the post-Twitter era. Users are organizing in-person meetups in Atlanta, New York and \u201cSpillicon Valley.\u201d At AfroTech, Spill gave out customized tea bags created with the help of Nigerian-American tea sommeliers while lines formed to use a Spill-branded 360 camera at a house party, inspired by an actual trend on the app where people share photos of themselves on Fridays.\nThe app is set to exit beta and open to the public next year. As Terrell previously discussed with TechCrunch, the app has plans to pay creators for their cultural contributions to the app, which is especially important for Black creators in the creator economy.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get credit for all the contributions that we make,\u201d Terrell said of Black artists in the space.\nDespite the robust year, however, the story for Spill is just beginning, with AfroTech reminding Terrell of how far they\u2019ve come, but also how far they have to go.\n\u201cTo be able to make something for the community, it\u2019s just really beautiful,\u201d he said.\nUpdate, November 7, 2:20 PM: Spill\u2019s seed extension is $2 million, not $2.75 million.\n\nThis article, authored by Amanda Silberling, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-07 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":488}

If any team achieved that goal, it was Chicago.\nIt wasn't an aesthetically pleasing game, but that was never the expectation. The Bears grinded out a 16-13 victory behind a terrific defensive performance, a solid running game, and a few timely throws by Tyson Bagent.\nThe Panthers jumped out to an early lead on a punt returned for a touchdown by Ihmir Smith-Marsette, but they never found the end zone again. The only offensive touchdown of the night came in the third quarter, when D'Onta Foreman rumbled his way into the end zone to give Chicago a 16-10 lead.\nNFL WEEK 10 PICKS: Straight up | Against the spread\nAs it turned out, 16 points was all the Bears needed. After Eddy Pineiro cut Carolina's deficit to three early in the fourth quarter, Frank Reich put his trust in Pineiro again with the game on the line, sending him out for a 59-yard attempt on fourth-and-10 in the final minutes rather than trusting the offense to pick up the 10 yards. Pineiro's kick was short.\nWhile the decision to kick from 59 yards out might be second-guessed, Carolina's offense didn't give Reich much reason to believe. Bryce Young struggled to develop any kind of rhythm through the first three quarters, and even the Panthers' most successful drives were laborious, consistently requiring conversions on third and fourth down.\nWhile Young got little help from his receivers, who failed to get open all night, his struggles \u2014 including multiple passes that were nearly intercepted \u2014 are a reminder that the Panthers' offense is still a long way from resembling anything like the unit owner David Tepper envisioned when the franchise traded for the No. 1 pick in March.\nMORE: Why Frank Reich's job might already be at risk\nThe Bears (3-7) are hoping to get Justin Fields back in time for their Week 11 game in Detroit, but they've gotten a shot in the arm from Bagent, who improved to 2-2 as a starter with the win.

{"title":"Rollback Policy, a Boon or a Curse? The Controversial System That Might Redefine the Golfing World by the End of 2030","context":"## Rollback Policy, a Boon or a Curse? The Controversial System That Might Redefine the Golfing World by the End of 2030\n\nThe distance golf balls travel has increased multifold. So a change is necessary to address the issue. Otherwise, the golf courses need to be perpetually extended. Not us. This is the opinion of both Royal & Ancient (R&A) and United States Golf Association (USGA) officials who decided it\u2019s time to bring in the golf ball rollback policy. According to them, with new technologies, golf balls are covering far more distance, resulting in lengthening the courses and incurring a greater financial burden on the golf clubs. Moreover, there are a growing number of voices who feel golf has become way less competitive nowadays.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nOn the other hand, there is a chance this might create bifurcation, which no one likes. The rules are non-binding in nature. So, tours and regional governing bodies can decide for themselves whether to implement them or not. Regardless, suppose R&A and USGA, which organize 35 championships between themselves, put this into action, and PGA and other Tours reject them. In that case, amateurs might be playing with \u2018corrected\u2019 balls, while the Tour pros will be playing with the same balls. Steeped in rich irony, indeed. Although the proposed rules are not set to be implemented before at least 2026, let\u2019s explore the existing complications.\nWhat happens to the majors with the rollback policy?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIf they pass the rules, the R&A that organizes The Open and the USGA, the organizer of the U.S. Open, will have the limited-flight balls in these two majors. What about the others? That\u2019s for the Augusta National and PGA of America to decide.\nNotably, Seth Waugh, the PGA of America CEO, in a memo to R&A, denounced the proposals, taking along nine other PGAs across the globe. While Fred Ridley, the chairman of Augusta National, didn\u2019t exactly bang the drum for MLR, the former amateur golfer did stand behind the governing bodies, saying he would much prefer to see the issue finally addressed. Notably, Augusta infamously \u2018Tiger-proofed\u2019 their course to make it \u2018tougher\u2019 for golfers (read Tiger Woods).\nOne thing should be noted here. Although R&A and USGA both organize two LPGA majors, the Women\u2019s Open and the U.S. Women\u2019s Open, respectively, the rules will apply only to two men\u2019s golf. Why? Because the average driving distance on the LPGA Tour is still well within the accepted norm of the two regulatory bodies. We haven\u2019t heard any noise from the female circuit, even though Lexi Thompson shot a 316-yard drive at the Shrines Children\u2019s Open. But the PGA Tour Pros and LIV Golf Pros chimed in with their thoughts.\nWhat do players think of this?\nMost players are less than happy with the change. And that reaction cut across the LIV Golf-PGA Tour divide. Justin Thomas, a fifteen-time winner on the Tour who is also a part of the PGA Tour policy board, termed it \u201cselfish\u201d on the USGA\u2019s part. \u201cI think the USGA over the years has, in my eyes, it\u2019s harsh but made some pretty selfish decisions,\u201d he stated. \u201cThey definitely, in my mind, have done a lot of things that aren\u2019t for the betterment of the game, although they claim it.\u201d\nThe 2022 PGA Championship winner drew an interesting comparison. In the NBA, players now jump much higher than they did in the 1990s. But the hoop height has stayed the same at 10 feet above the playing surface. The two-time Major winner credits the player\u2019s grind for this.\nWhat Is the Model Local Rule? As the Golf Ball Rollback Debate Takes Off Once Again, All You Need To Know About the USGA?s and R&A?s Brainchild\nEchoing similar sentiments, Bryson DeChambeau, who joined LIV Golf in 2022, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a great handicap for us guys that have worked really hard to learn how to hit it farther.\u201d The 2020 U.S. Open Champion regularly crushes drives to 310\u2013320 yards. No wonder he termed the policy \u201catrocious.\u201d\nInterestingly, Rory McIlroy, whose average of 326.7 yards puts him on top of the PGA Tour\u2019s driving distance leaderboard, backed this proposal for elite-level golfers. Speaking to the No Laying Up Podcast, the five-time Major winner said, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to help the overall professional game. I think making guys hit some long irons again and some mid irons and being able to hit every club in your bag in a round of golf.\u201d\nWhat does the Big Cat have to say about this? After all, it was Tiger Woods, whose astounding power behind the shots in the late 90s and early 2000s started the debate. Surprisingly, the fifteen-time major winner feels a course correction is necessary here. \u201cI think this should have happened a long time ago.\u201d\nIn fact, he said something that might not sit well with most, \u201cI\u2019ve been of the position if you play in a pro event or you have a P next to your name, you should be playing a pro ball. If you have an A next to your name and you\u2019re playing an amateur event, you should use an amateur ball.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nHow will the golf ball rollback policy affect LIV golfers?\nThe R&A and USGA have not made it binding on any governing bodies to implement the rules. For the breakaway league, this is the easiest path. One reason is that power hitters such as Bryson DeChambeau will be affected in more ways than one otherwise.\nSecondly, a league that thrives on thrills and excitement will lose its USP if the ball suddenly doesn\u2019t travel 300 yards on most occasions. As of this year, 28 of 48 LIV golfers average over 300 yards driving distance. Dustin Johnson and DeChambeau are both in the top five.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nBut one crucial thing to remember here is that the golf ball rollback policy will render most balls totally \u2018unplayable\u2019. Moreover, the PGA Tour has contradicted itself several times in the past few years. It won\u2019t be surprising if Monahan & Co. eventually decides to agree with the policy change sometime later. So, the question remains: how viable would it be for manufacturers to produce two types of balls, one for Majors and the other for LIV Golf? This just throws the world of golf into uncharted territory.\nWatch This Story: Is Tiger Woods Making Use Of Any Medical Aid After His Subtalar Fusion?\n\nThis article, authored by Parnab Bhattacharya, was published by Essentially Sports on 2023-12-03 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":490}
{"title":"The Apple Watch\u2019s double tap gesture points at a new way to use wearables","context":"## The Apple Watch\u2019s double tap gesture points at a new way to use wearables\n\nThe coolest Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 feature wasn\u2019t actually available when the watches launched last month. Double tap, which finally arrives today via the watchOS 10.1 update, lets you interact with the watch without ever needing to use the touchscreen. With a quick pinching motion, you can use it to scroll through the new smart stack of widgets in watchOS 10, pause or end timers, skip music tracks, and answer phone calls. It\u2019s the sort of feature that you might read about and scoff at \u2014 until you\u2019re unloading groceries from your car, hands full, and an important call comes through on your watch.\nDepending on who you are, this kind of scenario might happen multiple times a day or once in a blue moon. In the past few weeks with the watchOS 10.1 beta, some days I completely forgot double tap existed. Either my hands were free, or muscle memory kicked in and I\u2019d use the watch as I always have. Other days, when my to-do list felt as long as a CVS receipt, I morphed into a double tap fiend, so much so that I sometimes felt like a flamenco dancer snapping away with their castanets.\nDouble tap activates the primary action of an app. GIF by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nI got a rundown of how double tap works when I reviewed the Series 9 and Ultra 2, but it hits differently once you start using it in your day-to-day life. Controlling gadgets with gestures is often gimmicky \u2014 tech that seeks to show off rather than solve a problem. But double tap does solve a genuine problem and is born from accessible design that serves real needs. That, in turn, made me more curious about what went into creating the gesture, the tech behind it, its limitations, and what it implies for the future of smartwatches.\nThe chip behind double tap\nDouble tap technically isn\u2019t a new gesture so much. In 2021, Apple introduced Assistive Touch, an accessibility feature designed for people with limb differences or mobility issues. The idea was to give these folks a way to navigate through menus and control the Apple Watch without needing a second hand.\nOn the surface, it can seem like double tap is a rebadged version of Assistive Touch. That\u2019s led to understandable confusion as to how the two features differ \u2014 and why double tap isn\u2019t available on older Apple Watches that support Assistive Touch (Series 4 or later, including the first-gen SE and Ultra).\nThe short answer is that the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 have a more powerful chip. Specifically, the new S9 features four neural engines for machine learning, which is what powers double tap. On older watches, Assistive Touch was run on the main CPU. But is that distinction really enough to make a difference?\nThe double tap algorithm has to be able to sort through a lot of noisy data to detect when you are \u2014 and aren\u2019t \u2014 making the gesture. GIF by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nYes, according to David Clark, senior director of Apple Watch software engineering. \u201cBecause we\u2019re on a purpose-built part of the processor, we\u2019re not contending with all the other things the CPU is doing at any given time,\u201d says Clark. The result is the Series 9 and Ultra 2 are 15 percent more accurate at detecting the double tap gesture, and the feature itself is much less power intensive.\nI wouldn\u2019t blame anyone for feeling skeptical. But there is an absurd amount of data that needs to be processed for double tap to work. At the most basic level, the algorithm that detects the double tap gesture is trained on data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart rate sensor collected from the wrist.\nApple says that while the double tap gesture evolved out of Assistive Touch, it requires the computing power of the S9 SiP. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nIf you know anything about wearable sensors, that\u2019s not as simple as it sounds. Wrist data is incredibly tricky to work with because there\u2019s a lot of noise in the signal. On top of calculating how light reflects off of blood pumping through your veins, smartwatch algorithms have to account for your arm (plus muscles, veins, and tendons) physically moving around during different activities like walking, running, and gesticulating. Another challenge is no two people have the exact same body. Differences in wrist size and limb length have to be taken into consideration.\nIronically, the years that Apple put into improving heart rate helped cut through that noise. According to Clark, \u201cthe gaps in reliable signals for heart rate\u201d were what his team used to confirm subtler motions like the double tap gesture.\n\u201cReliability also means that when you\u2019re doing things that are almost like a tap, or a double tap, that we\u2019re not erroneously triggering the gesture.\u201d\n\u201cReliability means that when you do the gesture, we\u2019re able to detect it,\u201d Clark says. \u201cReliability also means that when you\u2019re doing things that are almost like a tap, or a double tap, that we\u2019re not erroneously triggering the gesture. We got to make sure we\u2019re able to detect the right thing through by tuning these things with the right scenarios.\u201d\nMeaning, the algorithm also has to be able to differentiate when someone is in motion, the type of activities they\u2019re doing, and what other features they may be using on the watch at a given point in time. Streaming music or taking calls might seem unrelated to double tap, but the algorithm must be able to account for the noise introduced by subsystems like LTE and Bluetooth. That\u2019s harder to do well when everything is done on the main CPU.\nDouble-click for the wrist\nThat\u2019s the technical side of the equation. But practically speaking, it\u2019s easier to see how Assistive Touch and double tap differ once you try using both.\n\u201cAssistive Touch is a comprehensive navigational system,\u201d says Eric Charles, senior manager of Apple Watch Product Marketing. For instance, if you use Assistive Touch, you\u2019ll notice a blue outline that visually cues the parts of a screen you can interact with when you can interact with them. You can enable a motion-based cursor as well. Another difference Charles points out is that with Assistive Touch, you have four gestures: single tap, double tap, clench, and double clench. According to Charles, it became evident early on that not everyone has the full strength to clench their hand, while others may not be able to do two quick, subsequent motions \u2014 such as a double tap.\nClenching is a gesture you can use with Assistive Touch, but it\u2019s there to provide a wider range of options for people who may not be able to make a pinching motion. GIF by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think of it necessarily as \u2018Hey, there are four available gestures here.\u2019 It\u2019s that audience needs the ability to customize those gestures in a way that you don\u2019t because your ability goes further than what they might be able to do.\u201d\nDouble tap isn\u2019t designed to help you navigate anything. The best way I can describe it is Assistive Touch is like the mouse to your computer. It scrolls, it selects, and it\u2019s highly programmable. Double tap is more like the double-click portion of using a mouse. You use it solely to perform the main action of an app. And to do that, Apple had to spend a lot of time researching what people wanted or expected a single double tap to do.\n\u201cWe collected data over hundreds of users, thousands of instances of these gestures internally to create models that represent all the different use cases we think [double tap] will be used in,\u201d explains Clark, noting that Apple cataloged all the potential user experiences that could potentially use double tap. It then solicited feedback from testers about how intuitive the feature was to use and whether it behaved in the way they expected. \u201cThere was an exhaustive list of screenshots, what those screens were, how a user could get to them, and then a detailed discussion through each and every one of those areas.\u201d\nThe answers from that internal research were then iterated multiple times, taking into consideration different types of testers. Some were complete novices, while others were more familiar with the gesture, and others yet were experts in human interaction engineering. That extensive feedback process is also why double tap is no longer called double pinch in Assistive Touch.\n\u201cWe did a lot of testing internally, and one of the things we learned is that when you tell someone to pinch, they hold the lower part of the gesture more than they release. Tap evokes a release,\u201d says Charles, who explained that the simple name change led to testers performing the gesture more accurately.\n(To be clear, we at The Verge will still be unofficially calling it the pinchy pinch.)\nThe limits of simplicity\nIn talking with Clark and Charles, it\u2019s clear Apple went through such a tedious process because this is supposed to be one of those magical features that \u201cjust works.\u201d\nAnd, when double tap performs as intended, it does feel a bit like the watch can read my mind. It\u2019s genuinely cool to see double tap work with not just my index finger but the rest of them as well. To my surprise, it feels less gimmicky than I expected. But despite Apple\u2019s efforts, it doesn\u2019t take long to run into double tap\u2019s limitations.\nDouble tap makes using the Smart Stack more intuitive, but I wish it could scroll AND select. GIF by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nMedia controls are a good example. Should a double tap either pause or play your music? Or should it let you skip to the next track? If you\u2019re someone who uses your smartwatch to control playback on smart speakers, the former makes more sense. If you\u2019re a runner and the wrong song pops up on your playlist, the latter is more useful. I\u2019ve run into this in various scenarios, but this happens to be one of only two instances where you can choose what double tap does. (For me, I\u2019ve set double tap to skip to the next track.)\nThat lack of choice is also apparent in third-party apps. My email app lets me double-tap to start a quick reply using Siri, but even in 2023, I am not dictating my emails. Apps like Spotify and Pocket Casts don\u2019t work with double tap, either. Most third-party apps that do work with double tap just let you dismiss notifications. That\u2019s helpful but still limiting.\nWith watchOS 10, apps like Fitness and Weather have been redesigned to be more glanceable. Instead of one long screen that you scroll endlessly through, information is divided into more digestible chunks. You still scroll, but there\u2019s less of it. This is great, except I often want to use double tap to navigate through menus instead of the digital crown. And I can\u2019t.\nYou can scroll through the new widget Smart Stack, but if I want to select a widget and open it, I still have to use my other hand. If I want to select a widget, I can customize it to do that, but it only ever selects the top widget. You have to just trust that Apple\u2019s algorithms will surface the right widget.\nCustomizability is currently limited to music playback and the smart stack. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge The double tap glyph lets you know when you can and can\u2019t use the gesture to control an action. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nMultitasking is another area where double tap can fall short. If I want to pause a timer but have navigated away from that app, I have to either use my other hand or use Siri. Otherwise, I can wait for the timer to go off and use double tap to end the timer.\nMore customization would be the obvious answer, but it\u2019s one that Apple was wary of for this first iteration of double tap.\n\u201cWhile customization can be a really powerful tool, oftentimes customization is where a lot more complexity can come into the process,\u201d says Clark. I get what Clark means. Not everyone, after all, has the patience to set up dozens of Focus modes or tinker with Shortcuts. If you want to keep things simple, you inevitably have to narrow the focus.\nA future of smartwatch gestures\nDespite the limitations, the combination of glanceable apps, widgets, Siri, and double tap has started to change how I use my Apple Watch. I never used to use the more analog, aesthetically pleasing watchfaces because it meant sacrificing my complications. With double tap, I can use those watchfaces now because all I have to do is flick my wrist and double tap to view my widgets. If I want to launch the app, I can just ask Siri to open it.\nYou can already use multiple fingers for the double tap gesture. It\u2019s not hard to imagine other iterations down the line. GIF by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nIt doesn\u2019t always work that seamlessly. There are times when the primary action isn\u2019t what I want to do, or eventually, I get to the point where I have to use my other hand. (In the above example, once I ask Siri to open the app, I may have to scroll with the digital crown to reach the information I need.) But it\u2019s not hard to imagine future iterations of double tap can both scroll and select. Something that\u2019s not quite as comprehensive as Assistive Touch but strikes a finer balance between simplicity and customizability \u2014 without relying too much on Apple trying to figure out what it is you want to do.\nEven now, with double tap\u2019s existing limitations, I can do more while on the go and without my phone. I find myself reaching for it much less \u2014 or when I do, it\u2019s for much more intentional purposes like reading, shopping, or watching a video. The past few weeks with double tap have felt like a glimpse into a smartwatch future that\u2019s independent of phones \u2014 devices that, instead of triaging notifications and calls, handle them entirely.\n\nThis article, authored by Victoria Song, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-25 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":491}

The Melbourne Rebels are expected to follow.\nRA chief executive Phil Waugh says building trust back between the governing body and states is essential to their plans.\nUnder fire Wallabies coach Eddie Jones also advocated for Australian rugby to move to a centralised model, believing the nation had fallen behind the rest of the world.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a state-based union that\u2019s run by the states, the national union wants to assume more responsibility and when things were going well, no one questioned that,\u201d Jones said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBut over the last period of time, they haven\u2019t been going so well and this tournament\u2019s probably been the icing on the cake where it\u2019s got to a stage where I think people, most people probably think there\u2019s time for change. But it\u2019s not going to go easy.\n\u201c[It\u2019s] one of the key issues. We need to maximize the development of the players. At the end of the day, that\u2019s the key to success and alignment of your resources, for a small country.\n\u201cBecause Australia, if you look at the history of rugby, when we were amateur, we were probably ahead of the game because we had the influence of rugby league. We had the influence of AFL and our players were more professional than the rest of the world.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI know what\u2019s going on and we need to get a better system of developing players. We need to develop better players and we need to develop a larger batch of better players and that only comes through changing the whole system.\u201d\nWhile all five Australian Super Rugby sides fundamentally are on board with regards to moving to a centralised high-performance program, The Roar added that some states, including the ACT Brumbies as well as the QRU, don\u2019t want to give up their commercial assets.\nThe QRU confirmed that on Wednesday morning.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe QRU is committed to working with Rugby Australia to lead reform of our game at a high-performance level, and help Rugby Australia develop an improved game through high-performance centralisation,\u201d the statement read.\n\u201cCentralisation\u201d would include a national player-contracting model, and alignment of key high-performance staff, such as coaching, strength and conditioning, and medical to operate as one national system.\u201d\nThe letter pointed to RA\u2019s involvement in Les Kiss\u2019 appointment as Reds coach, with the former State of Origin winger turned coach, who has spent the best part of two decades coaching in Ireland and England, replacing Brad Thorn.\nAs The Roar has previously reported, the QRU stopped short of wanting to hand over its commercial property.\n\u201cWhile the QRU is very supportive of high-performance alignment, it will not agree to any proposal on centralising commercial or corporate functions,\u201d the letter read.\n\u201cThe very strength of our State unions is the expertise they bring in their own markets.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe are open to work on commercial initiatives together but will always retain our independence for the benefit of Queensland Rugby, its members and stakeholders.\n\u201cQueensland Rugby has built a sustainable business model through the elimination of legacy operating debt, delivered four-straight operating profits and worked in partnership with Governments to successfully deliver $31 million of improvements to Ballymore through the construction of the National Rugby Training Centre, the home of the Wallaroos and Queensland Reds.\u201d\nThe letter also pointed to the 71,000 players across the state, including more than 16,000 of those female participants, 257 schools featuring rugby as part of its program, as well as its Hospital Cup competition and regional club competitions, as evidence that the game was in good health in Queensland.\nThe QRU also expressed its satisfaction that RA was willing to discuss the annual $1.7m being reinstated, which had been withheld because of the Covid pandemic to keep the game afloat.\nMeanwhile, The Roar understands the ACT Brumbies have sent RA confirmation of solvency for the next 12 months.\nRA was forced to take out a $40m loan from Ares to keep the game afloat.\nAdvertisement\nWhile RA has around another $15m left to spend from the loan, the governing body is looking to borrow up to another $60m so they\u2019re in the strongest possible position to capitalise on the two major money-making events \u2013 the 2025 British and Irish Lions series and home men\u2019s World Cup in 2017 \u2013 and succeed.\nRA is also in the early stages of looking to renew its next broadcast deal, with the governing body hoping to at least double its current deal with Nine Entertainment\/Stan Sport, which is seeing them paid $29m per year until the end of 2025.\n\nThis article, authored by Christy Doran, was published by The Roar | Sports Writers Blog on 2023-10-10 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":492}

Horne briefly worked at Saracens as a general manger.\nRA always said they wanted to have the role filled by Christmas, with chief-executive Phil Waugh saying the successful candidate had one of the biggest jobs to change the game\u2019s standing in Australia.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big job,\u201d Waugh said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest job on my leadership team in terms of the impact it has on the general sentiment around the game.\u201d\nHorne will oversee all of Australia\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s high-performance programs.\nAdvertisement\nHe will also be tasked with \u201cintegrating\u201d the programs, with RA trying to centralise all of the Super Rugby\u2019s high-performance programs.\nPerhaps most pressing will be building a list of coaching candidates to take over from Eddie Jones, with RA wanting to have the new Wallabies coach set in stone by the start of Super Rugby.\nHorne\u2019s close relationship with former Ireland coach and All Blacks assistant Joe Schmidt could be one of the keys to landing the 2018 World Rugby coach of the year.\nAfter leaving his Irish post after six years following the 2019 World Cup, Schmidt worked alongside Horne at World Rugby.\nIt\u2019s believed the duo have a strong working relationship.\nWhile Schmidt\u2019s Irish side bombed out in successive quarter-finals under his leadership, the New Zealander took the Emerald Isle to the top of World Rugby\u2019s rankings.\nAlong the way, Schmidt played an instrumental role in not just seeing them become one of the world\u2019s best teams but helped usher through transformational change off the field, as Ireland moved to a centralised system.\nAdvertisement\nSchmidt briefly exited the international coaching scene following the 2019 World Cup, citing a desire to move home to New Zealand to be closer to his family.\nBut after initially moving back into the coaching fray with the Blues in Super Rugby, he joined the All Blacks ahead of last year\u2019s Rugby Championship as New Zealand Rugby shook the All Blacks coaching team up following their historic series loss to Andy Farrell\u2019s Irish.\nSchmidt\u2019s expertise proved telling, with he and Jason Ryan transforming the All Blacks and helping Ian Foster\u2019s side reach the final of this year\u2019s World Cup after stunning wins over Ireland and Argentina in the knockout stages.\nImportantly, the 58-year-old, The Roar understands, is interested in the Wallabies coaching job.\nDan McKellar, Stephen Larkham, Andy Friend and Ian Foster remain interested in the role.\nShould RA move on him, Schmidt\u2019s backing would be largely supported by the Super Rugby franchises, with several sources telling The Roar that the experienced coach is exactly the type of person the Wallabies need.\nAdvertisement\nAfter a year in where the Wallabies\u2019 detail and nous was clearly absent on the field, the highly detailed Schmidt would help bring rugby smarts to the Australian program.\nIndeed, the manipulation and ability to play both sides of the ruck was clearly visible by Ireland during his Irish tenure.\nWhat\u2019s more, should RA go down a path of bringing Schmidt into the fold, his own relationship with Ireland\u2019s long-time director of high-performance David Nucifora could see the Australian reconsider his position with the governing body.\nLast year Nucifora told The Roar he would unlikely consider returning to RA when he leaves his post with Ireland following next year\u2019s Olympics.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d be wise to revisit,\u201d Nucifora said.\n\u201cI think that you have a go at something once, you do your best and then if it\u2019s not good enough or it didn\u2019t work you move on, do something else.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhat\u2019s changed back there that I could think that, what I can offer, can change what they\u2019re doing still?\n\u201cI\u2019ll always love rugby.

{"title":"Fantasy Football RB Rankings Week 12: Who to start, best sleepers at running back","context":"## Fantasy Football RB Rankings Week 12: Who to start, best sleepers at running back\n\nAs we trot into Turkey Day week, only three more regular-season weeks remain until the fantasy football playoffs. Every decision \u2014 from the tough starts to the difficult sits; the savvy waiver adds to the costly drops \u2014 can ultimately decide whether your team is a contender or a pretender. Our Week 12 fantasy RB rankings for standard leagues will help guide you to the right moves and hopefully land you a big \"W\" for which to be thankful.\nTrade deadlines have passed in most leagues, so the majority of fantasy owners must soldier on toward the home stretch with the main core they have built to this point. On a positive note, we have no byes to worry about this \u2014 just plenty of short turnarounds, some potential weather concerns, and of course, the dreaded injury bug. Fortunately for us, we have been ahead of the curve with sleepers and breakouts all season, so we're more prepared to weather any storm than the average fantasy Joe.\nLet's get right to our Week 12 RB rankings so you can fully prepare for Thanksgiving week and put out a lineup with backs who will feast like the rest of us.\nMORE: Watch NFL RedZone live with Sling (50% off first month)\nWhich RBs are on bye in Week 12?\nNone! It's a Thanksgiving miracle! Not only do we not have any byes to worry about this week, but we also have NFL action on four different days (Thursday, Friday, Sunday, Monday).\nWEEK 12 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nIn some ways, however, a bye-free week at this stage of the season presents more challenges than ever. Whereas byes make some start 'em, sit 'em decisions no-brainers, 16-game weeks make it a lot easier to get lineup decisions wrong. Don't worry \u2014 we'll steer you in the right direction and keep you apprised of all the information you'll need throughout the week.\nWEEK 12 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWho are the best fantasy RBs in Week 12?\nAs always, Christian McCaffrey (@ Seahawks in Week 12) heads the list as the most matchup-proof running back in the NFL. Right behind him, Austin Ekeler (vs. Ravens) will look to bounce back after an uncharacteristically rough showing in Green Bay last week.\nAgainst the Commanders last week, Saquon Barkley (vs. Patriots) looked as good as we've seen him this season (140 total yards, two TDs). The Pats have surrendered 116 scrimmage yards per game and nine total TDs to RBs this season, so we like Barkley to pick up where he left off this Sunday (drive up that free-agency value, 'Quon!).\nYou don't see running mates cracking the top five very often, but we had to make the exception for David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs (vs. Packers). Entering Week 11, Green Bay had surrendered nearly 140 all-purpose yards per game to RBs. Between Detroit's o-line, the Lions' high-flying offensive attack, and the ruthless 1-2 punch DMont and Gibbs have been this season, the feast could be on very early for Dan Campbell's guys.\nTake a collective sigh of relief, Tony Pollard (vs. Commanders) owners! TP looked solid against Carolina last week, averaging 5.1 yards per carry and finally getting into the end zone for the first time since Week 1. We have the Cowboys back just outside our top five with a juicy matchup against a Washington D that just got lit up by Saquon and the G-men.\nRaheem Mostert (@ Jets) should continue to eat for Miami, with rookie De'Von Achane (knee) unfortunately getting hurt almost immediately after returning from IR (more on that later). Gang Green hasn't been nearly as good against the run as it has been against the pass, as Jets opponents have averaged 139 rushing yards per game over the past two weeks. 'Fins backup Salvon Ahmed also landed on the IR with a foot injury, so consider stashing Jeff Wilson Jr. as a handcuff.\nRounding out the top 10, the trio of Travis Etienne (@ Texans), Josh Jacobs (vs. Chiefs), and Breece Hall (vs. Dolphins) will be looking to bounce back from disappointing Week 11 outings on the ground. All three of these backs have been mostly solid, and none have much to worry about in terms of backfield competition.\nWEEK 12 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nWho are the best fantasy RB sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 12?\nSleep on Rhamondre Stevenson (@ Giants) at your own peril. 'Mondre has accumulated 231 yards from scrimmage and a TD over New England's past two games, and the Pats are coming off bye. Washington just carved the G-men up like a turkey on the ground last week, surrendering a whopping 174 yards and a TD. Gobble gobble.\nGet Kyren Williams (@ Cardinals) right back into your lineup the moment Los Angeles activates him from IR. Arizona just made Devin Singletary look like Barry Sanders, so Williams (ankle) should enjoy a triumphant return to the field. Keep rolling with Alexander Mattison (vs. Bears), too, against another below-average run defense.\nWelcome to the top 25, Zach Charbonnet (vs. 49ers)! With Kenneth Walker III's oblique injury comes opportunity for the rookie, who already looked strong in the month leading up to Seattle's narrow Week 11 loss to the Rams. Sure, Charbs' 69-yard effort in Los Angeles last week was a bit underwhelming, but we love his upside with a full game as the Seahawks' bell-cow.\nSpeaking of bell-cow backs, things are looking very promising for the short-term workload of Green Bay's AJ Dillon (@ Lions). Veteran Aaron Jones (knee) and rookie Emanuel Wilson (shoulder) both got hurt in Week 11, so Dillon should be the main man in Motown for the Pack. Power backs have enjoyed the most success against the Lions, as evidenced last week by Chicago's Roschon Johnson averaging 5.0 yards per carry and D'Onta Foreman finding paydirt.\nWEEK 12 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nWho are the biggest potential RB busts in Week 12?\nWe don't quite have the intestinal fortitude to bench Derrick Henry (vs. Panthers), but we must absolutely temper our expectations with the dude at this point. Over the past two weeks, he has tallied just 64 total yards on 23 touches (2.8 yards per touch). Carolina served as Tony Pollard's get-right game last week, so fire King Henry up if you have him. If he falters against the Panthers, you better have a backup plan moving forward (picking up Tyjae Spears as insurance is a good place to start).\nBoth Darrell Henderson and Royce Freeman (@ Cardinals) would be decent dart throws in a week filled with byes, but their floors in a zero-bye week seem too low to trust them if Kyren Williams is back and at 100 percent. The matchup is juicy, but we have no idea what to expect from a touch-share perspective, so these guys are no better than desperation, TD-dependent flexes.\nSpeaking of guys coming back from injury, we saw Khalil Herbert (@ Vikings) return to the field for Chicago against the Lions last week. However, his performance left a lot to be desired. He finished with just 35 yards on 16 carries and wound up vastly overshadowed by Justin Field's 100-yard rushing effort. Even worse, D'Onta Foreman scored the Chi's lone rushing TD on the afternoon.\nI don't care what your team looks like \u2014 you shouldn't be starting Chuba Hubbard or Miles Sanders (@ Titans). They weren't awful against Dallas last week on a per-touch basis, but neither finished with more than 12 touches. Even worse, no Carolina back has enjoyed a 60-yard rushing game since Oct. 15. Bad offensive line, negative game scripts, awful coaching \u2014 it's all bad, man!\nWhat are the biggest RB injuries in Week 12?\nSecond-year Seahawks back Kenneth Walker III suffered an oblique injury in Week 11 that the ever-hip Pete Carroll referred to as \"legit.\" KW3 has a better chance of missing multiple weeks than he does at suiting up for Seattle's Thanksgiving Day game against Fred Warner and the 49ers. If Zach Charbonnet somehow finds himself on your waiver wire, an early Merry Christmas to you if you have the FAAB or a high waiver priority.\nThe hits just keep on coming for the Packers' Aaron Jones, who suffered a knee injury but seems to have at least caught a break in the sense that he didn't tear his ACL. However, even a moderate MCL sprain could mean a multi-week absence for the injury-prone veteran back, especially in a lost season for the 4-6 Pack. Rookie Emanuel Wilson also hurt his shoulder in Week 11, so AJ Dillon could be getting the keys to Green Bay's backfield castle (although it's more of an oversized shack, at this point).\nDolphins rookie De'Von Achane, who looked like the runaway Offensive Rookie of the Year earlier this season, looked to have aggravated his MCL injury upon his Week 11 return against the Raiders. Achane has a chance to return for Miami's Week 12 tilt with the Jets on Friday, but we wouldn't be surprised if the 7-3 'Fins play it safe and keep him out until he's back to 100 percent. Meanwhile, Miami placed backup Salvon Ahmed on IR with a foot injury, so Jeff Wilson Jr. could be back in play as a handcuff stash.\nBears veteran D'Onta Foreman injured his ankle in Week 11. He could miss some time now that Khalil Herbert and Roschon Johnson are both back in action for Chicago.

{"title":"A provocative role for technologists in product innovation","context":"## A provocative role for technologists in product innovation\n\nProduct design is in a moment of profound change and redefinition as technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and spatial computing dramatically affect computing experiences. AI, especially, may have only minor impacts on interface design but will significantly impact the holistic product or ecosystem experience. Spatial computing, on the other hand, will change human-computer interactions and unmoor our understanding of what a computer is.\nIn this innovation cycle, product design requires a wider perspective of platforms and interconnections between technologies, creating a strong need for technologists and designers to be in the process together.\nFor successful products and businesses, innovation is perpetual. There is a never-ending search to find the next new thing that enhances the user experience, extends product reach, expands revenue, or all three simultaneously. Product design makes innovation less daunting and increases chances for success because it is a multidisciplinary process with structures and frameworks to catalyze innovation. Technologists have a role in the process that expands beyond simply validating the technology or concept, which is their customary responsibility. Before discussing the nontraditional ways technologists participate in product innovation, let\u2019s conceptually examine innovation and product design.\nThe word innovation has a simple meaning \u2014 to introduce something new or a novel method of doing something \u2014 yet we frequently inflate it to mean something magical, grandiose, and world-changing. Innovation can just as easily be mundane and straightforward. The key to innovation is being \u201cnew.\u201d The \u201cnew\u201d can be localized to a team, product, process, or business unit. The \u201cnovel\u201d can be well-known and established practices not incorporated into your workflow or product. Sometimes, innovation comes from closing small gaps and isn\u2019t always a grand eureka moment.\nInstead of forcing a technology onto a product, the design process flows to the technologies. In this way, the technology becomes a natural solution.\nProduct design is a process and not a discipline or deliverable. It is (understandably) easy to limit the scope of product design to color choices, content layout, and aesthetics. Too often, design is minimized to only the act of making user interfaces pretty. Product design is much deeper and broader in scope than visual design assets. For example, product design can give direction and focus to a business strategy, user experience strategy, or technology explorations.\nThe process establishes a guide rail throughout any innovation initiative. The core of product design is decision-making with an astute instinct for making the best decisions at the most opportune time. Product design helps reduce risk and leads to more effective innovation through quality decision-making.\nA progressive role for technologists\nTechnologists play a strategic role in product innovation and should bring a metaphysical perspective in addition to being punctilious. Our job is to communicate the essence of a technology and think strategically about the application of technologies to problem spaces. We are most constructive when we translate the technicals of \u201chow to make X do Y\u201d to \u201cthese are the types of products and services realizable with technology X.\u201d\nFor most technical leads and software developers, this is a mode inversion from our traditional tactical and direct interaction with technology. The context switch from daily build-and-operate is challenging but is paramount to developing successful and innovative products. We are uniquely positioned to generate strategic insights translated from dense technical minutiae that drive innovative business cases and product experiences.\nA technology innovation must solve a business problem, such as improving operational efficiency, growing existing revenue streams, or generating new ones. The problem space may be customer-facing (e.g., how can we deliver a new feature?) or internal-facing (e.g., how can we make a process more efficient?). The problem is the paramount concern. The specific technologies or innovations used to solve the problem are often less critical. We cannot lose perspective of the business needs; otherwise, the activities become too academic or a paid hobby.\nAn ordinary domestic analogy is hanging a picture. The hole size, bracket, or tools used to hang the picture are immaterial as long as the picture is on the wall and straight. The specifics of the process and technologies are only important as they pertain to how well they solve the problem, the costs to do so, and the overall end user experience.\nProduct innovation is experimental and should not always be expected to yield productive results. It requires a learning curve and patience, as the outcomes are often ambiguous and unknown. Business leadership can struggle with this perspective because it is indefinite (in terms of results and timelines), and it is challenging to translate pure technology innovation into value creation. A gap opens between technology and product teams wherein technology teams strain to articulate the capabilities and value of a technology innovation, leading to unfilled promises and the perception of \u201ctechnology for the sake of technology\u201d or quips like \u201ca solution looking for a problem.\u201d\nThe current hype cycle in AI serves as a great concrete example. For technology or product executives, the challenge is how to do more than check the AI box \u2014 it\u2019s about how to meaningfully incorporate AI into a product. Instead of forcing a technology onto a product, the design process flows to the technologies. In this way, the technology becomes a natural solution.\nAs experts on a technology or technology stack, we can communicate abstract insights or contribute in more conceptual contexts. Technologists add value to the product design process by sharing their expertise on a technology\u2019s characteristics. Designers use this information to shape and exploit technologies in the visual and interaction design process. In this way, technologists inform new interaction models, interface metaphors, and product channels. This involvement gives confidence and conviction to the promises of design.\nThink of digital technologies as a material like paint, stone, or wood. For artisans to create with materials, they must understand the material\u2019s ontology and phenomenology. An artist must know the differences between oil, acrylic, or watercolor paints because each material has different properties that affect how and what can be created. Technologists must \u201cfind the grain\u201d of a technology. In this way, they become an intermediary between the abstract nature of design and the pedantic nature of technology. This philosophical perspective is especially important when a product is in a growth stage or when using emerging technologies.\nRegardless of whether your product is growing or in a stable stage or employs established or emerging technologies, integrating technologists into the product strategy and design process enriches the final outcome. There is a technology perspective extending beyond the operations and mechanics of the code \u201cfactory floor,\u201d which provokes innovation.

NBA prop bets are an easy way to jump into basketball betting.\nProposition bets, or props, are easy to understand, numerous, and cover both player props and team props to give you plenty of variety.\nBelow, we look at betting NBA props at the best NBA betting sites and share some key information to make informed bets.\nWhat are NBA props?\nA prop bet is a side wager on an aspect of a game that usually doesn\u2019t tie directly to the result. In the NBA, prop bets deal with both players and teams.\nSome examples of NBA player props are:\nHow many points a player will score\nNumber of rebounds a player will have\nHow many assists a player will get\nRebounds and assists combined\nPoints, rebounds, and assists combined\nHow many steals a player will get\nNumber of three-pointers made\nSome examples of NBA team props include:\nWhich team will reach 10 points first\nWhich team will have the highest-scoring period\nWhich team will score first\nWhich team will win the first half\nWhich team will win the second half\nWill there be a fourth-quarter comeback victory\nAll of the best sports betting sites have their selection of prop bets for each NBA game, so shop around to find the sportsbooks that best suit your needs.\nHow to bet on NBA props\nThe first step to betting on NBA props is opening an account at an online sportsbook. The process is simple, free, and doesn\u2019t take very long. Below are the steps to opening a new account at an online sportsbook.\nChoose your sportsbook: Any state with legal online sports betting has a variety of sportsbooks. If you aren\u2019t sure which sportsbooks best fit your needs, research and read our reviews on each. And don\u2019t forget that you can have an account with more than one. Once you decide which sportsbook you\u2019re interested in, follow the link from our site to qualify for the best new customer welcome bonus.\nRegister for an account: At the top of the homepage of the sportsbook website, you will find a button that says \u201cregister\u201d or \u201csign up.\u201d Click that, and you\u2019ll be taken to a form you must fill out. It will ask for personal information such as your name, phone number, email address, last four digits of your Social Security number, and more.\nAccept the terms and conditions: Before finalizing your account information, you must accept the sportsbook\u2019s terms and conditions. We recommend you read through these to understand the rules your sportsbook will enforce regarding bets, especially for the sports you intend to wager on. The terms and conditions are also available on the sportsbook website for you to read at any point.\nGet your bonus: At this point, you can accept your welcome bonus. Be sure to read through the bonus requirements before accepting anything. If a bonus code is needed, which you can find on our website, this is where you will input it during the registration process.\nMake a deposit: Now that you\u2019ve signed up for an account, you can start funding your bankroll by making a deposit. Most legal sportsbooks have a variety of ways you can add funds to your account, such as through your bank or an e-wallet.\nStart betting: Go to the basketball section of your sportsbook and select the NBA. From there, you can choose individual games and make bets like money lines, point spreads, totals, props, futures, and more.\nHow to read NBA props odds\nAt first glance, all the positive and negative numbers at US sportsbooks can be daunting. The good news is they are easy to read once you understand what you see.\nNegative numbers, such as -110, represent how much money you need to wager to win $100. In many cases, such as a moneyline bet, the negative number also indicates which side of the bet is the favorite to win.\nFor example, if you were to bet on LeBron James scoring over 15.5 points in a contest at -125 odds, you\u2019d need to wager $125 to win $100. If you did and your bet was correct, then you\u2019d take home $225, which is your original $125 stake returned to you plus your $100 in profit.\nPositive numbers, like +145, show how much you stand to win for every $100 you wager. If you were to bet $50 on Giannis Antetokounmpo to have over 7.5 rebounds and the odds were +130 at the time you finalized your bet slip, you would win $65 in profit if your bet wins.\nPositive numbers also indicate which side of the bet is the underdog in the eyes of the oddsmakers.\nRemember that you can bet as little or as much as you want, and your payout will be calculated based on your wager amount and the odds at the time you make your bet.\nTypes of NBA props\nYou can make two main prop bets on the National Basketball Association:\nTeam props\nPlayer props\nTeam props are typically focused on statistical accomplishments by a particular team and rarely on the game\u2019s result. You\u2019ll often come across NBA team prop bets that are based on a team\u2019s points, such as the first team to reach 20 points, the first team to score in a game, or whether the total points by both teams in a contest will end up being odd or even.\nTeam props, also known as \u201cgame props,\u201d don\u2019t rely on individual players but rather on the team as a whole. Player props, on the other hand, are driven by individual performance.\nThese individual props are focused on statistical milestones during a game. The most popular bets typically focus on points, rebounds, assists, and three-point field goals. You can also bet on combination wagers, such as points and rebounds together.\nIn most cases, you can bet on traditional statistics for the five starters on each team.\nSee more:\nTips for betting on NBA props\nEvery bettor should develop their strategies, but we do have three tips you can use for NBA props.\nPay attention to player and team news: Oddsmakers use various information to develop their lines for games and players, and you should, too. Keep tabs on player news and injuries, when top players are being rested, how they performed in recent games, and more. You can find value in player and team props by gathering information from multiple sources and tracking how players and their teammates perform. For example, if one of the starting guards is questionable for a game, you might want to consider the other guard for increased points or assists since they\u2019ll likely handle a heavier load.\nKeep an eye on usage and minutes: Even slight increases to a player\u2019s average minutes can make a difference when betting player props, especially later in the season when aging veteran players tend to rest more. Keep yourself informed on usage and minutes trends for the players you\u2019re considering betting on, and use them to your advantage. Remember that some of the best players in the NBA were once on the bench for most games until small increases in their playing time gave them a chance to shine.\nShop for the best lines: This tip applies to every bet you make. Using multiple sportsbook accounts lets you find the best odds for every NBA prop bet. Even the smallest differences, like one sportsbook having odds at +125 and another at +135, can make a difference in your profit. By shopping for the best lines, you can make smarter bets and find the best value.\nRelated Pages:\n\nThis article, authored by Sam Eggleston, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-02 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":497}
{"title":"The UK just laid out new rules for the internet \u2014 it only gets harder from here","context":"## The UK just laid out new rules for the internet \u2014 it only gets harder from here\n\nAfter the Online Safety Act\u2019s arduous multiyear passage through the UK\u2019s lawmaking process, regulator Ofcom has published its first guidelines for how tech firms can comply with the mammoth legislation. Its proposal \u2014 part of a multiphase publication process \u2014 outlines how social media platforms, search engines, online and mobile games, and pornography sites should deal with illegal content like child sexual abuse material (CSAM), terrorism content, and fraud.\nToday\u2019s guidelines are being released as proposals so Ofcom can gather feedback before the UK Parliament approves them toward the end of next year. Even then, the specifics will be voluntary. Tech firms can guarantee they\u2019re obeying the law by following the guidelines to the letter, but they can take their own approach so long as they demonstrate compliance with the act\u2019s overarching rules (and, presumably, are prepared to fight their case with Ofcom).\n\u201cWhat this does for the first time is to put a duty of care on tech firms\u201d\n\u201cWhat this does for the first time is to put a duty of care on tech firms to have a responsibility for the safety of their users,\u201d Ofcom\u2019s online safety lead, Gill Whitehead, tells The Verge in an interview. \u201cWhen they become aware that there is illegal content on their platform, they have got to get it down, and they also need to conduct risk assessments to understand the specific risks that those services might carry.\u201d\nThe aim is to require that sites be proactive to stop the spread of illegal content and not just play whack-a-mole after the fact. It\u2019s meant to encourage a switch from a reactive to a more proactive approach, says lawyer Claire Wiseman, who specializes in tech, media, telecoms, and data.\nOfcom estimates that around 100,000 services may fall under the wide-ranging rules, though only the largest and highest-risk platforms will have to abide by the strictest requirements. Ofcom recommends these platforms implement policies like not allowing strangers to send direct messages to children, using hash matching to detect and remove CSAM, maintaining content and search moderation teams, and offering ways for users to report harmful content.\nLarge tech platforms already follow many of these practices, but Ofcom hopes to see them implemented more consistently. \u201cWe think they represent best practice of what\u2019s out there, but it\u2019s not necessarily applied across the board,\u201d Whitehead says. \u201cSome firms are applying it sporadically but not necessarily systematically, and so we think there is a great benefit for a more wholesale, widespread adoption.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also one big outlier: the platform known as X (formerly Twitter). The UK\u2019s efforts with the legislation long predate Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, but it was passed as he fired large swaths of its trust and safety teams and presided over a loosening of moderation standards, which could put X at odds with regulators. Ofcom\u2019s guidelines, for example, specify that users should be able to easily block users \u2014 but Musk has publicly stated his intentions to remove X\u2019s block feature. He\u2019s clashed with the EU over similar rules and reportedly even considered pulling out of the European market to avoid them. Whitehead declined to comment when I asked whether X had been cooperative in talks with Ofcom but said the regulator had been \u201cbroadly encouraged\u201d by the response from tech firms generally.\n\u201cWe think they represent best practice of what\u2019s out there, but it\u2019s not necessarily applied across the board.\u201d\nOfcom\u2019s regulations also cover how sites should deal with other illegal harms like content that encourages or assists suicide or serious self-harm, harassment, revenge porn and other sexual exploitation, and the supply of drugs and firearms. Search services should provide \u201ccrisis prevention information\u201d when users enter suicide-related queries, for example, and when companies update their recommendation algorithms, they should conduct risk assessments to check that they\u2019re not going to amplify illegal content. If users suspect that a site isn\u2019t complying with the rules, Whitehead says there\u2019ll be a route to complain directly to Ofcom. If a firm is found to be in breach, Ofcom can levy fines of up to \u00a318 million (around $22 million) or 10 percent of worldwide turnover \u2014 whichever is higher. Offending sites can even be blocked in the UK.\nToday\u2019s consultation covers some of the Online Safety Act\u2019s least contentious territory, like reducing the spread of content that was already illegal in the UK. As Ofcom releases future updates, it will have to take on touchier subjects, like content that\u2019s legal but harmful for children, underage access to pornography, and protections for women and girls. Perhaps most controversially, it will need to interpret a section that critics have claimed could fundamentally undermine end-to-end encryption in messaging apps.\nThe section in question allows Ofcom to require online platforms to use so-called \u201caccredited technology\u201d to detect CSAM. But WhatsApp, other encrypted messaging services, and digital rights groups say this scanning would require breaking apps\u2019 encryption systems and invading user privacy. Whitehead says that Ofcom plans to consult on this next year, leaving its full impact on encrypted messaging uncertain.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not regulating the technology, we\u2019re regulating the context.\u201d\nThere\u2019s another technology not emphasized in today\u2019s consultation: artificial intelligence. But that doesn\u2019t mean AI-generated content won\u2019t fall under the rules. The Online Safety Act attempts to address online harms in a \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d way, Whitehead says, regardless of how they\u2019ve been created. So AI-generated CSAM would be in scope by virtue of it being CSAM, and a deepfake used to conduct fraud would be in scope by virtue of the fraud. \u201cWe\u2019re not regulating the technology, we\u2019re regulating the context,\u201d Whitehead says.\nWhile Ofcom says it\u2019s trying to take a collaborative, proportionate approach to the Online Safety Act, its rules could still prove onerous for sites that aren\u2019t tech juggernauts. BBC News notes that Ofcom\u2019s initial set of guidance is over 1,500 pages long. The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit behind Wikipedia, tells The Verge that it\u2019s proving increasingly challenging to comply with different regulatory regimes across the world, even if it supports the idea of regulation in general. \u201cWe are already struggling with our capacity to comply with the [EU\u2019s] Digital Services Act,\u201d the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s VP for global advocacy, Rebecca MacKinnon, says, pointing out that the nonprofit has just a handful of lawyers dedicated to the EU regulations compared to the legions that companies like Meta and Google can dedicate.\n\u201cWe agree as a platform that we have responsibilities,\u201d MacKinnon says, but \u201cwhen you\u2019re a nonprofit and every hour of work is zero sum, that\u2019s problematic.\u201d\nOfcom\u2019s Whitehead admits that the Online Safety Act and Digital Services Act are more \u201cregulatory cousins\u201d than \u201cidentical twins,\u201d which means complying with both takes extra work. She says Ofcom is trying to make operating across different countries easier, pointing toward the regulator\u2019s work setting up a global online safety regulator network.\nPassing the Online Safety Act during a turbulent era in British politics was already difficult. But as Ofcom begins filling in its details, the real challenges may be only beginning.\n\nThis article, authored by Jon Porter, was published by The Verge on 2023-11-09 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":498}

{"title":"49ers cap space 2024: Why Chase Young trade may not be a pure rental for San Francisco","context":"## 49ers cap space 2024: Why Chase Young trade may not be a pure rental for San Francisco\n\nThe 49ers made the biggest move ahead of the 2022 NFL trade deadline when they acquired running back Christian McCaffrey from the Panthers. They once again made a splash ahead of the 2023 trade deadline when they traded for Commanders pass rusher Chase Young.\nYoung was among the most notable players dealt ahead of the 2023 trade deadline. The No. 2 pick in the 2020 NFL Draft is in the midst of a breakout season, totaling five sacks in eight games and generating a solid 18 pressures while getting into the backfield often for the Commanders.\nBut as Washington jettisoned its top two defensive ends, Young and Montez Sweat, the 49ers found themselves positioned to pounce. They traded a 2024 third-round pick to get the talented defender and reunite him with his college teammate and fellow No. 2 pick, Nick Bosa.\nYoung should provide a boost to a 49ers defense that ranks just 22nd this season in sacks per game at 2.3. But many are wondering whether Young will end up being a rental for the 49ers or more of a long-term investment.\nThat will all depend on how San Francisco manages its salary cap in 2024.\nMORE DEADLINE: Live tracker | Grading every trade\nOn the surface, it may look hard for the 49ers to re-sign Young long-term; in reality, the team has more flexibility to do so than it would initially appear. Here's why.\n49ers cap space 2024\nAs it stands, the 49ers don't project to have much cap space in 2024. In fact, OverTheCap lists San Francisco as having just $1,479,772 in available space. That is good for the seventh-least in the NFL.\nThat said, the 49ers are equipped to increase their cap space with relative ease. How? Well, they have at least one player on their roster, Randy Gregory, who has an eight-digit salary but doesn't have any guaranteed money left on his deal. That means that the 49ers could release him without taking a dead-cap hit, which is a financial term for when a player no longer on the roster is still owed guaranteed money; that would open up $14 million more in cap space.\nElsewhere, the team has 10 other players on the active roster set to have cap hits of at least $14.1 million who could restructure or extend their contracts.\nWhen NFL teams restructure contracts, they typically take a player's base salary \u2014 which is accounted for in a one-year duration \u2014 and turn it into some sort of signing bonus. That bonus is allowed to be prorated over the duration of the contract, so it spreads what would be a high, one-year cost out into a moderate cost over several years.\nTypically, players who have their contracts restructured have high cap hits and high base salaries. So, in looking at the 49ers' highest-paid players for 2024, there are a few options for restructures, as you can see below.\nPlayer 2024 cap hit Base salary Dead cap hit Trent Williams $31.7 million $20.1 million $29.9 million Arik Armstead $28.6 million $17.4 million $25.9 million Deebo Samuel $28.6 million $21 million $26.5 million Fred Warner $24.5 million $15.3 million $25.6 million George Kittle $22 million $13.4 million $18.9 million Charvarius Ward $17.9 million $12.6 million $17.2 million Javon Hargrave $15.5 million $8.9 million $33.4 million Nick Bosa $14.6 million $1.1 million $76.5 million Brandon Aiyuk $14.1 million $14.1 million $14.1 million Christian McCaffrey $14.1 million $11.8 million $8.6 million\nSo, if any of Williams, Armstead, Samuel, Kittle or Warner were to restructure their contracts or if a player like Aiyuk got an extension, that would push some of the 49ers' cap hits into future years. That could prove a worthwhile move if it allows for the team to keep Young and keep its Super Bowl window open with the ultra-cheap Brock Purdy at quarterback.\nOf course, the team could also release some of its players, like Gregory, to open up space. It doesn't seem likely that any of the players listed above would be cut or traded as all are owed hefty guarantees and come with big dead-cap hits; but the 49ers could trim from the margins of the roster if they need just a bit more cap space to keep Young around.\nBut a restructuring of contracts will almost certainly happen in San Francisco during the offseason; it's just a matter of which and how many players will get that treatment and whether those funds will be allocated to Young or other portions of the roster.\nIYER: Grading the Chase Young to the 49ers trade\nChase Young contract projection\nAssessing how San Francisco can try to keep Young also includes looking at what Young's value might be on the open market. It's likely that the 24-year-old will get a large payday as a free agent, but it's just a matter of how big it will be.\nSpotrac.com projects that Young should make about $17.8 million annually on a four-year deal. However, that seems a bit light considering that it includes a couple of interior defensive linemen \u2014 Dre'Mont Jones and Zach Allen \u2014 among his closest comparisons.\nIt seems more likely that Young will be paid to his potential as well, considering that he missed a lot of time in Years 2 and 3 with injuries. Thus, he may end up being highly paid in terms of average annual value (AAV) but he may see lower-end guarantees.\nAt the end of the day, however, the deal that seems most likely to suit him is one similar to the extension that the Packers gave Rashan Gary.\nGary is set to have an AAV of $24 million over the duration of that contract while making $96 million over four years. However, only $34.6 million of that deal is guaranteed, as Gary was inconsistent to start his career and dealt with a torn ACL in 2022.\nRashan Gary contract value\nLength 4 years Total value $96 million AAV $24 million Guarantees $34.6 million\nYoung could hypothetically crack $100 million if he's allowed to hit the open market, but the Gary deal projection seems like a sensible ballpark for now.\nOf course, the 49ers could also try to slap him with the franchise tag if they're worried about paying him and Bosa big bucks long-term. That was worth just under $20 million last season, so that may look like San Francisco's best avenue toward keeping its Super Bowl window ajar.\nHowever, one-year deals are often complicated to fit into smaller amounts of salary cap space, so the 49ers would likely prefer to get a long-term agreement in place with Young to keep him. At the end of the day, franchising him may not be worth the hassle \u2014 even if he is easily the team's best free agent in 2024.\nMORE: Why the 49ers traded for Chase Young, explained\n49ers free agents 2024\nYoung's quest to earn a deal with the 49ers could be aided by the fact that they don't have many key players set to be free agents in 2024.\nAs it stands, only 15 other 49ers are set to be free agents in 2024.

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nEmily Ratajkowski\u2019s latest photo shoot has sparked backlash among plus-size models and activists, who claim it promotes unhealthy narratives about body image.\nThe supermodel, 32, recently shared several images from her photo shoot with M Le Monde magazine. For the fashion editorial photographed by Oliver Hadlee Pearch, Ratajkowski posed in a variety of looks featuring denim jeans and flowing tops. However, it was the second image that caught the attention of her Instagram followers.\nIn the photo, Ratajkowski is seen wearing a pair of low-rise, wide-leg denim jeans double her size. She showed off her toned figure as the oversized pair of jeans fell at her feet. As she held up the waistband of the jeans with one arm, Ratajkowski stood in one leg of the pair of jeans to highlight the noticeable size gap.\nThe photo shoot - which was styled by Charlotte Collet and creative directed by Jean-Baptiste Talbourdet-Napoleone - instantly sparked backlash after Ratajkowski shared the images to Instagram. In her comments section, thousands of users criticised both Ratajkowski and the team behind the photo shoot for the \u201cout of touch\u201d image and claimed the photo shoot was \u201cfatphobic\u201d.\nFamous plus-size models and inclusivity advocates - such as Tess Holliday, Kelly Augustine, Stephanie Yeboah, Letticia Munniz, and Sarah Chiwaya - have called out the photo for emphasising Ratajkowski\u2019s thinness in a pair of pants that would typically be reserved for someone who is plus-size.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for those jeans in the second photo if you could just please return them that would cool. Tysm,\u201d Holliday commented under Ratajkowski\u2019s post.\n\u201cThat second photo is such godforsaken trash,\u201d wrote Chiwaya. \u201cIn the year of our lord 2023?? STILL??? Yikes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat in the fatphobic hell is that second picture?\u201d a third user commented, while someone else said: \u201cThat second pic is so out of touch and ignorant but the comments are chef\u2019s kiss.\u201d\nPlus-size models have long advocated for more inclusive sizing - both in stores and on the runway. However, luxury brands and labels often avoid creating plus-size fashion over claims that it\u2019s too expensive to make. \u201cDesigners won\u2019t make plus sizes unless it\u2019s for a photo opp where a thin person can be quirky,\u201d another person pointed out.\nMany people were especially surprised by the \u201cdistasteful\u201d photo shoot considering Ratajkowski has published a book of essays about feminist empowerment and the objectification of women\u2019s bodies, titled My Body. \u201cNot sure how you think wearing oversized jeans made for a much larger person and accentuating your smallness promotes healthy body image like you preach in your books\/social media,\u201d an Instagram user said.\nSince she shared snaps from the photo shoot over the weekend, Ratajkowski has not yet commented on the backlash. Despite the controversial editorial, the model has previously spoken out against body-shaming. In her book of essays, Ratajkowski discusses bodily autonomy and exploitation in the modelling industry. \u201cEvery woman I know - doesn\u2019t matter what they look like, or if they\u2019ve commodified their image or not - knows what it feels like to be looked at, to be rejected, to get attention for how they look,\u201d she told The Independent in 2021.\nBack in 2019, Ratajkowski defended her friend against body-shaming trolls after their bodies were compared on Instagram. The model shared a bikini-clad post to promote her swimwear line, Inamorata, but several users accused Ratajkowski of sharing the photograph to make her body look \u201cbetter\u201d.\nIn response, Ratajkowski commented: \u201cI love my friend\u2019s body and both her and I think she looks great here! And I\u2019m proud she\u2019s rocking my suits. All these haters are crazy. Just because you\u2019re used to seeing one body type on the internet doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s the only kind that should be considered \u2018beautiful\u2019.\u201d\nWhile the body positivity movement has made waves over the past 10 years, this year in fashion was especially devoid of inclusivity or plus size models. According to Vogue\u2019s Business Size Inclusivity Report, only 0.6 per cent of looks shown throughout the autumn\/winter 2023 fashion season were modelled by plus-size people.\nDespite the fact that the plus-size clothing market is expected to reach $288bn this year, according to Future Market Insights, advocates have maintained that they\u2019re unable to purchase clothing that\u2019s both sustainable and inclusive. \u201cI have to wear fast fashion and high street to major red carpet moments, and that\u2019s great, but I want the option to wear high end items of my choosing and it\u2019s not available,\u201d Holliday told Elle UK in 2019. \u201cBut it\u2019s either that or I run around naked. Plus-size fashion is not there yet.\u201d\nThe Independent has contacted representatives for Ratajkowski and M Le Monde for comment.\n\nThis article, authored by Meredith Clark, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-11-30 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":502}
{"title":"Economists, central bankers are rethinking the quantitative easing strategy that saved the world but created bubbles and distortions","context":"## Economists, central bankers are rethinking the quantitative easing strategy that saved the world but created bubbles and distortions\n\nAfter the most aggressive monetary-tightening campaign in four decades, academics and economic practitioners are running autopsies on what could have prevented the cost-of-living crisis and how to ensure the same mistakes won\u2019t be repeated.\nMarkets have scrambled to price in high-for-longer interest rates, with a new war in the Middle East adding yet more risk to an already uncertain outlook confronting central bankers as they gather for their penultimate meetings of a tumultuous year.\nThe policy navel-gazing is centering around three debates. How much flexibility central banks can allow in reaching their inflation targets, the effectiveness of asset purchases in the policy mix, and the merits of monetary and fiscal coordination.\nBloomberg surveyed economists from around the world to gather views on those three debates. Their verdict: Central banks won\u2019t break their economies in a rush to hit inflation targets, QE will be used more sparingly in the future, and fiscal policy risks countering the work of monetary authorities.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says\u2026 \u201cA long period of galloping price gains, and fears that the last yards back to target could be most painful for workers, have reignited the debate about whether central banks should aim for a higher rate of inflation. That\u2019s a conversation worth having. But for monetary policymakers, the imperative of retaining credibility means the right time for it is after inflation is back at target, not before.\u201d \u2014 Tom Orlik, chief economist\nRethinking Targets\nSo long as people believe prices will get back toward 2%, central bankers have some leeway in deciding how aggressive they need to be in pursuing that goal.\nEconomists covering 16 of the world\u2019s most important central banks say policymakers will allow more time to bring inflation back to target if it means less damage to their economies. The Bloomberg special survey also shows that a sizable minority sees them going even further, accepting price pressures that are either slightly too strong or too weak \u2014 as long as expectations remain anchored.\nOlivier Blanchard, a former IMF chief economist, has long argued in favor of raising the inflation target, and former European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio has also embraced the idea. But it\u2019s a controversial view and only possible from a position of credibility, which means central banks would likely have to get inflation back to 2% first.\n\u201cIt would be a mistake of the first order to think you can change a goal you have set if you can\u2019t achieve it,\u201d according to Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel.\nGlobal trends suggest inflation will be stronger than in the past, with former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney among those saying rates won\u2019t return to pre-pandemic lows.\nOne lesson Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s No. 2 official, draws from the latest inflation episode is that policymakers mustn\u2019t assume that looking through supply shocks \u2014 as text books suggest \u2014 is the optimal response. She recommends they be ready to react preemptively, even when inflation hasn\u2019t yet spun out of control.\nThey may be called into action soon on that front, should an escalation in the conflict in the Middle East hit oil deliveries.\nWhen the next big global slowdown comes, though, flexibility may be needed the other way. Europe\u2019s eight-year experiment with negative rates ended with mixed reviews last summer as to whether it was all worth it.\nThe Bank for International Settlements argues that there\u2019s room for greater tolerance for moderate shortfalls even if they\u2019re persistent, because \u201clow-inflation regimes, in contrast to high-inflation ones, have self-stabilizing properties.\u201d\nRethinking Quantitative Easing\nWith a more flexible approach to those 2% targets, monetary policy after the 2008 financial crisis would have looked very different in many parts of the world. Trillions of dollars, euros, yen and pounds of asset purchases did little to raise prices in the face of global disinflationary forces until governments used the money they raised to stuff cash into consumers\u2019 pockets during Covid lockdowns.\nBut that\u2019s also been blamed for distorting financial markets. Episodes such as the Silicon Valley Bank blow-up are seen by some as a direct result of central bank reserves creation under QE, along with regulatory and supervision failures.\nOnly 40% of economists surveyed predict central banks will use QE the same way as they did before. A quarter expect them to deploy it more sparingly, about 30% see its only role going forward as a tool to address financial-stability concerns and a small minority doesn\u2019t see it being used again at all.\nThere are other problems with bond-buying that may affect how it\u2019s used in the future. QE effectively swaps long-term borrowing costs for short-term ones. What\u2019s been a lucrative deal for taxpayers when official interest rates were low has now turned into a disastrous trade.\nThe clearest depiction of the problem is in the UK, where the BOE secured taxpayer indemnity for any losses on QE. Over the next decade, it estimates, its purchases will cost the government over \u00a3200 billion ($243 billion).\nAnd policymakers have little experience in unwinding their balance sheets, where small mistakes can trigger big market turbulence.\nThe Fed experienced some of that when it tried to shrink bond holdings between 2017 and 2019. More recent efforts to reduce portfolios have progressed rather smoothly, partially because central banks have amassed so much debt over the years that they\u2019re far away from any thresholds that would trigger a squeeze.\nBut the fact that they\u2019re treating quantitative tightening as a technical adjustment rather than a part of their efforts to conquer inflation raises questions about the future use of a tool that\u2019s only trusted to work one way.\nThe ECB faces an extra legal burden on bond holdings that comes with operating in a currency union of 20 countries. Concerns around illegally financing governments and debt mutualization have already landed the central bank in court several times.\nMixing Policies\nLow interest rates and large-scale QE programs allowed treasuries to borrow on the cheap to finance stimulus campaigns, protecting labor markets, businesses and consumers from collapse. But the spending blowout throughout and since the pandemic \u2014 part critical emergency funding, part political need to show an all-hands-on-deck approach in crisis \u2014 contributed to the latest outbreak in inflation.\nWhile the same kind of pulling in the same direction is needed to restrain demand, many governments are concerned that if they tighten policy too hard, voters will kick them out and replace them with populists or extremists. That\u2019s reviving questions about whether central banks can deliver price stability all on their own.\n\u201cIf we were designing optimal policy arrangements from scratch, monetary and fiscal policy would both have a role in managing the economic cycle and inflation, and that there would be close coordination,\u201d Philip Lowe said in his last speech as Australian central bank governor in September.\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg predict fiscal policy will somewhat counteract the Fed\u2019s efforts to rein in inflation in the US.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that there are circumstances where working hand in hand and supporting each other has proved helpful,\u201d ECB President Christine Lagarde told a panel discussion in June at the institution\u2019s annual economic forum.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, who sat to her right, signaled he wasn\u2019t ready to rely on that kind of cooperation. \u201cOur assignment is to deliver price stability kind of regardless of the stance of fiscal policy.\u201d\nCentral bankers warn that any failure to scale back fiscal spending risks coming at the cost of yet higher interest rates. They also want elected officials to put in place policies that help deliver sustainable growth.\n\u201cA change in mindset needs to happen,\u201d said Agustin Carstens, the former governor of the Bank of Mexico who\u2019s now the general manager of the BIS. \u201cGrowth needs to depend less on fiscal and monetary policy, it should depend more on structural policies.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Jana Randow, Bloomberg, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-22 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":503}
{"title":"Michigan\u2019s Rivals Fume About Sign-Stealing: \u2018This Was Damn Near Espionage\u2019","context":"## Michigan\u2019s Rivals Fume About Sign-Stealing: \u2018This Was Damn Near Espionage\u2019\n\nFor the past two weeks, coaches across college football have been riveted by the alleged Michigan sign-stealing scheme, but inside the Big Ten, the topic has been more than just a curiosity. On Wednesday\u2019s Big Ten coaches video call with commissioner Tony Petitti, and after Jim Harbaugh left the call, that frustration was voiced loud and clear, according to conference coaches, who said they don\u2019t feel like the new Big Ten commissioner is \u201cmotivated\u201d to do anything about the Wolverines.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere is just a ton of frustration,\u201d a Big Ten coach told The Athletic on Thursday morning. \u201cLook at Jim Harbaugh\u2019s record before this started. The guy was on the hot seat before 2021, and now he\u2019s like the king of college football. \u2026 No doubt this all has had a profound effect.\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s being investigated for three different things now between the (alleged) illegal signal stealing, the (alleged) illegal recruiting during COVID and that investigation into the offensive coordinator and alleged computer hacking. There are guys (on that call) who could lose jobs, and then there\u2019s this guy over here (Harbaugh) who is gonna get a new, bigger contract now, and they won\u2019t do anything about him.\u201d\nAsked to describe the tone of the coaches\u2019 sentiment expressed to Petitti, another Big Ten coach called it \u201cangry\u201d \u2014 particularly at the Big Ten\u2019s lack of action, or even apparent interest in taking any.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s upset,\u201d that coach told The Athletic. \u201cWhy is nothing being done? We want to know, what else do you need to know to take action? We (the Big Ten head coaches) want something done now. I don\u2019t think people understand the advantage that what they\u2019re (allegedly) doing gives you. People think, \u2018OK, now that everybody knows, we all can just move on.\u2019 Like, \u2018now, it\u2019s fair.\u2019 Well, no, it isn\u2019t. Not at all. This changes the way you operate. A lot of teams have been doing things a certain way for years. Now, it\u2019s forcing you to teach your players a whole new way to communicate just for them. People think that this is just advanced scouting. This was damn near espionage.\u201d\nA third Big Ten head coach told The Athletic that this is \u201cone of the most egregious breaches in the spirit of the game\u201d he\u2019s ever heard of.\n\u201cThey (Michigan) have been manipulating the game and cheating the game for two-and-a-half years. To know exactly what the other team is doing, Michigan might as well have been playing with 15 guys on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the message the Big Ten is sending now by doing nothing? Win now, pay later? We might as well just send people to (scout) their practices and their games. It doesn\u2019t encourage anybody to follow the rules. It\u2019s just telling them to do the opposite and say, f\u2014 it.\u201d\nGO DEEPER Michigan should be punished, say 94% of CFB coaches in our poll. What else did it reveal?\nThe NCAA is investigating Michigan\u2019s football program amid allegations that the Wolverines used illegal in-person scouting and the recording of signals to steal signs this season. Ahead of the Michigan-Michigan State game on Oct. 21, the Big Ten approached MSU and said it was made aware of \u201ccredible evidence\u201d regarding the sign-stealing allegations. The Big Ten said it would monitor the NCAA\u2019s investigation into Michigan.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe Big Ten is so much more powerful than the NCAA,\u201d that third Big Ten coach said. \u201cWhy are you just sitting back and doing nothing about this? The Big Ten can\u2019t pound its chest for the last 30 years about how it does the right thing ethically (when other conferences like the SEC won\u2019t) and then have this go on. If this were a team in the bottom half of the Big Ten, would this be handled in the same way?\n\u201cWhen a running back gets hurt against Michigan because they knew exactly what play was coming, will that kid and his family have the ability to sue the Big Ten?\u201d\nThe NCAA investigation is ongoing, a process that typically moves slowly, which makes it difficult to imagine it will reach a resolution by the time the postseason begins. The Big Ten does have the ability to act under its sportsmanship policy, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it would want to act quickly or decisively before the NCAA completes its entire investigation and allows Michigan a chance to respond to its findings.\nThis is an unprecedented situation; whatever Petitti decides to do (or not do) will set a precedent. The Big Ten itself doesn\u2019t have investigators, so it needs to rely upon the NCAA to do that part \u2014 and to determine who else was involved in the alleged scouting scheme. It\u2019s not clear exactly what the coaches would want the league to do to punish Michigan; banning the team from competing in the Big Ten championship, for example, would harm players who had nothing to do with the sign-stealing apparatus.\nA source briefed on the coaches\u2019 call said Big Ten coaches are concerned about whether Michigan \u201cshould represent the Big Ten.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter what happens, if Michigan continues to move forward, the clouds will follow,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey\u2019re reading the tea leaves and wondering why the Big Ten hasn\u2019t done anything yet. Every week and every day that goes by, people are like, \u2018Something\u2019s gotta give.\u2019 It\u2019s getting a little bit out of hand when you see him (allegedly) on the Central Michigan sideline. The playing field is not level right now. How can you have a team that you know has a competitive advantage over you still being allowed to play? That\u2019s what the coaches are grappling with.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt feels like (former commissioner) Kevin (Warren) taking over and then COVID,\u201d the source continued. \u201cTony\u2019s walking into this situation, and people are calling for the league to make a statement before they have all the facts.\u201d\nDespite frustration from all corners of the conference, sources at four different Big Ten schools said they do not expect the conference to levy any sort of punishment against Michigan before the season ends.\nEarlier this week, Central Michigan said it is investigating whether suspended Michigan staffer Connor Stalions was on the CMU sideline during the Chippewas\u2019 Sept. 1 game at Michigan State. Screenshots of a person who looks similar to Stalions began circulating online Monday night, and The Athletic obtained more photos of the person on the sideline Tuesday.\nCentral Michigan is investigating if the person on the right here is Connor Stalions on the CMU sideline at Michigan State earlier this season.

Stalions bought tickets to games in at least seven Big Ten stadiums before those teams played the Wolverines over the past three seasons, including the 2023 season, sources told The Athletic last month. Purchasing the tickets is not a violation of NCAA rules, but using them to scout and record other teams would violate the rules, prohibiting in-person, on-campus scouting and the audio or video recording of signals.\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t allegations. It happened,\u201d Purdue coach Ryan Walters said Thursday night on his radio show ahead of Saturday\u2019s game against the Wolverines. \u201cThere\u2019s video evidence. There\u2019s ticket purchases and sales you can track back. We know for a fact they were at a number of our games. We\u2019ve had to teach our guys a new language.\u201d\nOn Monday, coach Jim Harbaugh met with reporters and said \u201cthe people that know us the most think the most of us\u201d as Michigan faces the NCAA investigation.

{"title":"Discord\u2019s latest teen safety blitz starts with content filters and automated warnings","context":"## Discord\u2019s latest teen safety blitz starts with content filters and automated warnings\n\nDiscord is introducing new safeguards to protect young users. On Thursday, the company announced Teen Safety Assist. The rollout will happen in the coming weeks and consists of two features: Automated alerts and content filters.\nMoving forward, when a user a teen hasn\u2019t chatted with before sends a direct message, Discord will display a safety alert if the platform\u2019s automated systems suspect the teen\u2019s safety could be at risk. The prompt will nudge the young person to reconsider if they want to respond to the message, and point them to the app\u2019s block feature and related safety tips.\nBy default, Discord will now also automatically blur potentially sensitive images from a teen\u2019s friends. Young people can disable the feature through an option in Discord\u2019s settings menu. Adults, meanwhile, can enable the filters for themselves, if they want the additional protections.\nThe introduction of Teen Safety Assist comes amid increased scrutiny of Discord\u2019s efforts to limit the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and protect young users from predatory adults. In June, NBC News identified 35 cases over a period of six years where adults had allegedly used the platform to kidnap, groom or sexually assault minors. The outlet also found 165 cases where authorities were prosecuting adults for sharing CSAM over Discord or allegedly using the platform to extort young users into sending sexual images of themselves.\nIn the aftermath of the report, Discord banned teen dating servers and changed its safety policies to ban the sharing of AI-generated CSAM. It also announced new rules explicitly prohibiting any other kind of text or media content that sexualizes children. At the same time, the company introduced Family Center, a dashboard for parents and guardians to keep track of what their teens are doing on Discord.\nDiscord\n\u201cTeens are still in the process of learning about themselves and what it means to be online, and our new safety features are rooted in providing them with agency on the platform, to give them ways to learn and grow in safe and age-appropriate online spaces,\u201d said Savannah Badalich, senior director of policy at Discord. \u201cThese newest features are part of an ongoing, multi-year effort to continually evolve and advance safety on Discord.\u201d\nAt the same time, Discord is introducing a new warning system for people who violate its policies. Outside of incidents involving the most \u201cextreme\u201d violations, the company is moving away from permanent bans. It\u2019s doing so under the belief that most users will choose to be better online citizens given the chance and proper guidance.\nIn practice, the system will notify a person when they\u2019ve violated one or more of Discord\u2019s policies and detail the restrictions on their account. It will also link out to the company\u2019s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines and appeal mechanism. A new \u201cAccount Standing\u201d tab within the settings menu will allow users to see all their current and past policy violations.\n\u201cWe think we\u2019ve built the most nuanced and proportionate reporting system,\u201d Badalich told Engadget, adding the company hopes other platforms will look to what Discord has created for inspiration related to their own enforcement efforts. \u201cWe believe people, especially teens, have the capacity to grow.\u201d\nSeparately, Discord announced a slew of new features and enhancements slated to arrive either in the near future or down the line. To start, the platform\u2019s in-app shop, which Discord began testing last month with Nitro subscribers, will soon be available to all users. The marketplace features digital items people can use to decorate their avatars and profiles. Discord will offer store discounts to Nitro members, as part of a new perk for signing up.\nDiscord\nThis week, the company will also start a broad roll-out of a feature called Remix. It allows users to edit an image directly within Discord\u2019s mobile app and share it with their friends and servers. The company spent much of the last year improving its Android and iOS clients. One recent update saw it improve app launch times on both platforms. In the near future, Discord says people can expect a new \u201cMidnight\u201d dark mode the company claims reduces battery consumption on devices with OLED screens, more functional notification tabs and a new search feature for the settings menu to make it easier to find the exact option you\u2019re looking to tweak.\nLast but not least, the company says it will begin rolling out Premium App Subscriptions to eligible developers in the UK and Europe, following a launch that began in the US a few weeks ago. On the subject of third-party apps, bots and plugins, the company said it\u2019s in the process of exploring how to make those accessible across nearly every part of Discord. It provided few details on the effort, but said the goal is to allow people to access their favorite apps and bots without those experiences being restricted to select servers.\n\u201cWe're experimenting with a few different things, but the goal is for developers to reach more people with the awesome experience they're building. For users, we don\u2019t want them to be gated from having these custom experiences at their fingertips,\u201d Cherry Park, director of product marketing at Discord, told Engadget. \u201cIn terms of the way we architecture and build it, there are a couple of solutions. Some are easier, some are more difficult, and you're going to see us experiment with a few of them over the next few quarters.\u201d\nDiscord promised to share more about its efforts around app portability in the near future. In the meantime, Nitro subscribers will get a chance to test new features before they become available to the public.\nUpdate, October 20, 2023, 11:20 AM ET: This story has been updated to note that these feature are rolling out in the coming weeks, not this week as the post originally said. We also removed a mention that Discord would automatically delete potentially sensitive content from strangers. This was originally part of a briefing we received on the new features, but it was not included in the final release.\n\nThis article, authored by Igor Bonifacic, was published by Engadget on 2023-10-19 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":505}
{"title":"The airline parts scandal sparking panic and introspection in aerospace","context":"## The airline parts scandal sparking panic and introspection in aerospace\n\nHis company is accused of falsifying the records that come with aviation components to show they are the real deal. CFM, a joint venture between GE and Safran that manufactures engines, is now pursuing a legal case against AOG in Britain\u2019s High Court. Zamora is defending the case. Verification documents are important because of the exacting specifications of airline parts. Engine modules must tolerate temperatures that would melt many materials and even basic parts must be certified. Because of these demands, even a bolt can cost thousands of dollars if it is holding an engine in place. As a result, the market for airline parts is a very lucrative one. Since 2015, Zamora has charmed his way deep into the complex network of companies and decision makers who move billions of dollars worth of airline parts around the world.\nBusiness associates who worked with him outside AOG and who were willing to speak to The Telegraph describe a savvy operator who was fun to be around. Loading Zamora, who is Venezuelan, got his start in aviation in 2010 as an account manager at AJW, an engine maintenance business, according to Bloomberg. A keen techno DJ, he was also gigging as recently as 2018 according to the Daily Mail. Zamora founded AOG in 2015 from a rented terraced house in Hove, about 70 kilometres south of London on the UK\u2019s South Coast.\nIt appeared to be small scale in its early years: the company\u2019s registered address moved between four homes in the following three years, shifting from Hove to London in 2017. Then, the company was registered at serviced offices in central London. Friends say they haven\u2019t been in contact with Zamora in a number of months as he begins his defence in London\u2019s High Court. AOG\u2019s website appears offline, but a cached version says the company offered \u201ca diverse portfolio of quality products and services\u201d. \u201cWith our head office in the UK and warehouse operations in London, Frankfurt, Miami and Singapore, we are uniquely positioned to support our customers around the world \u2013 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,\u201d the website read. \u201cWe keep our clients flying.\u201d The company\u2019s phone line is still connected but offers only endless hold music.\nAOG is understood to have sold mainly smaller parts for jet engines, such as bolts, nuts, washers, dampers and seals. The parts don\u2019t carry a serial number and are therefore harder to trace. Worryingly, some bigger parts appear to be linked to the scandal. Some turbine blades have also been identified by CFM as suspect. CFM is understood to believe that AOG had been passing off old parts for new ones. Steve Borrowdale, managing director at Multiflight, a Leeds-based engineer and parts supplier, says sneaking parts into a jet engine is difficult. After vetting a seller for experience and approval certification, a buyer would also carefully inspect a part from a new supplier.\n\u201cYou get the box, you\u2019d have a look, just for simple things. If there\u2019s a brand-new part coming in a non-identified box, you might start to question it.\u201d Choosing parts without serial numbers could make falsifying documents easier, he said, but it would still take great skill. The supply of parts in aviation is through a dazzling patchwork of thousands of often small manufacturers, brokers and distributors. Credit: Bloomberg \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just take a novice off the street and start selling these things, you would have to have gotten some training somewhere along the way.\u201d According to filings at Companies House, AOG grew slowly from 2015 until 2019, when the company had net assets of \u00a322,000 ($42,000).\nBy early 2020, it was worth \u00a32.2 million. A breakthrough came when it won a deal with logistics firm B&H Worldwide to distribute parts from its hub in Frankfurt. \u201cThe two companies have previously worked together for exports to Europe and the US from the UK, but this is the first time they have partnered in mainland Europe,\u201d the pair said in a press release in 2020. AOG\u2019s cash bonanza came before the COVID-19 lockdowns of that year, according to the filings. The pandemic grounded flights and was a disaster for the aviation industry. However, the end of lockdowns triggered a resurgence in international travel and a rush to secure jets and parts amid backlogs in factories. The parts scramble that followed would be a perfect breeding ground for an unscrupulous seller, said Borrowdale.\n\u201cSince COVID, raw materials are increasingly difficult to get hold of,\u201d he said. The supply of parts in aviation is through a dazzling patchwork of thousands of often small manufacturers, brokers and distributors. Manufacturers and operators are heavily regulated and largely responsible for orchestrating the paper trail that follows every aviation part, from computers and fuselage panels to screw housings and washers. CFM has had to audit more than 500 suppliers to try and find out what items could be caught up in the crisis. The parts so far identified in the forgery scandal are not thought to include the most sensitive components, known as life-limited parts, which operate under the most stress in a jet engine and are carefully monitored by manufacturers while operating on the plane. However, even dodgy fastenings have claimed lives.\nPartnair Flight 394 crashed off the coast of Denmark in September 1989, killing all 55 passengers and crew, after its tail fin came off. Three of the four bolts holding the fin in place were counterfeit and weaker than those designed for the plane. The weak bolts and other maintenance problems allowed vibrations that caused the rudder to fail and break off, investigators later found. Loading Following that incident and other bogus parts scandals, Mary Schiavo, who was inspector general at the US Department of Transportation in the early 1990s, ran a campaign against the sale of unapproved aircraft parts and helped secure more than a hundred criminal convictions. She uncovered bogus components that had been made by manufacturers that had lost their certification to make the parts, old equipment passed off as new, re-labelled defective parts and outright fakes that were never designed for aviation use. These are largely the categories into which bad parts still fall, she says. Unapproved parts were even found in part of a fire control system on Air Force One in 1995, she said.\n\u201cLiterally, if it\u2019s on an aeroplane, it could be fake.\u201d Following her investigation, various reforms came in, including a warning system to flag suspicious components. \u201cI\u2019ve had cases where counterfeit parts have caused deaths. What\u2019s at stake is the safety of the lives of the flying public.\u201d While plane and engine manufacturers, pilots and aviation companies are heavily regulated, distributors are not, she warns. She pushed for tighter rules in the 1990s but was ignored. The High Court case against AOG began on September 21 and is ongoing.\nThe UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority has said it is supporting the US Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency in investigating the matter. A spokesman for CFM said: \u201cWe are working collaboratively with operators, so they can promptly remove the unauthorised parts from their engines in accordance with the recommendations issued by the regulatory agencies. \u201cWe remain united with the aviation community in working to keep unapproved parts out of the global supply chain.\u201d B&H was approached for comment. Zamora was approached for comment through friends and his barrister.

{"title":"Flipboard becomes a federated app with support for ActivityPub","context":"## Flipboard becomes a federated app with support for ActivityPub\n\nInstagram Threads isn\u2019t the only app joining the decentralized social web, which includes Twitter\/X rival Mastodon and other apps, with its newly added support for the networking protocol ActivityPub. Today, the social magazine app Flipboard is announcing it has also now integrated with ActityPub. In its initial phase, select Flipboard accounts will be discoverable and can be followed by the millions of users of decentralized social apps, including Mastodon. Over time, all profiles on Flipboard will be available in the fediverse, as this network of decentralized social apps is known.\nThe company announced its intention earlier this year to participate in the fediverse. It began by integrating its app with Mastodon via an API and setting up its own Mastodon server, flipboard.social, ahead of full ActivityPub integration. This allowed Flipboard to get a feel for the world of decentralized social media, and learn how its users would respond. It also gave Flipboard a way to stay connected to social media after Twitter\/X increased its API fees for third-party developers, making it unsustainable for many developers to continue to work with the company.\nThe Flipboard app\u2019s primary purpose has been to curate into social \u201cmagazines\u201d news and information found on the web, including links to articles, photos and other social posts. As a result, it had relied on Twitter as one of its sources of information. That changed this year, when Flipboard shifted its Twitter integration over to Mastodon and another alternative social app, Bluesky. It also set up its own Mastodon server and began curating news across the fediverse via editorial \u201cdesks\u201d focused on improving the discovery of news on Mastodon.\nAll this was in the lead-up to making Flipboard itself a federated social app, a process that\u2019s kicking off today.\nInitially, Flipboard is testing the integration with select accounts, including publishers like Semafor, Pitchfork, Fast Company, Medium, LGBTQ Nation, Refinery 29, Digiday, Polygon, SPIN, Kotaku, Frommer\u2019s, The Verge, Smithsonian Magazine, Refinery 29, The Root, ScienceAlert, AFAR Media and others. While many are focused on news, there are also some nonprofits like The News Literacy Project and education-focused news site The 74, in this debut list.\n\u201cAs we said in the earlier part of this year, we will be embracing ActivityPub into Flipboard and effectively reworking our whole backend to that,\u201d explained Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, in a conversation with TechCrunch about the coming changes. He says the company had first integrated with Mastodon at the API level, so users could log into their Mastodon accounts, see those posts and interact with others in the fediverse from Flipboard. \u201cBut you had to have an account on all those platforms,\u201d McCue noted.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re announcing on Monday is basically our roadmap for how we will be rolling out ActivityPub, and effectively tearing down the walls around our own walled garden,\u201d he added.\nWith the changes, when Flipboard users curate an article or post into one of their social magazines on Flipboard\u2019s app, with an optional comment, that \u201cflip,\u201d as it\u2019s called, will also appear as a post on their new flipboard.com Mastodon account. This is not the same server as Flipboard had set up before (flipboard.social), which was a place to experiment with decentralized social media. Instead, it\u2019s the Flipboard app itself that\u2019s now connected to the fediverse. Users\u2019 posts on Mastodon will include a link both to the article being flipped and to the user\u2019s Flipboard magazine, while the user profile will point to their Flipboard profile page.\nAs this rolls out, all Flipboard users will have one Flipboard.com account connected to the fediverse, even if they host numerous Flipboard magazines. That\u2019s not ideal as their magazines may focus on different topics. But McCue believes that Mastodon could one day support a notion of sub-feeds that would allow more differentiation.\nUsers will be able to opt out of having their \u201cflips\u201d posted on Mastodon, but being opted-in will be the default experience. The company expects to have all its user accounts connected to the fediverse by the end of January. (This won\u2019t impact any magazines set to \u201cprivate\u201d on Flipboard. Those will remain private, McCue notes.)\nToday, Flipboard has over 10,000 publishers of social magazines on its app and over a quarter million individuals who are curating content using Flipboard\u2019s app. Given that Mastodon today has around 1.5 million monthly active users, this could be a notable bump for the fediverse when Flipboard\u2019s integration fully rolls out, assuming Flipboard\u2019s users don\u2019t opt out.\nFlipboard is only one of now several companies that has embraced decentralized social media. In addition to X rival Instagram Threads, which began testing ActivityPub last week, other tech companies are moving in this direction, as well. Automattic made it possible for all WordPress.org and WordPress.com blogs to become federated, and said it\u2019s working on doing the same with Tumblr next year. Medium and Mozilla have also set up their own servers, and the latter backed a Mastodon client called Mammoth, too.\nFor Flipboard, after integrating its back end with the fediverse, the company may reconsider what its front end should look like, too, for this new age of social media.\n\u201cThe front end was built at a time pre-federation,\u201d noted McCue. \u201cWhat are the implications of federation in the front end? How do we think about curation and all the things, all the capabilities and tools that we\u2019ve created over the years? How does that work in a world that\u2019s federated, and from a user experience point of view? That is a great question,\u201d he said.\nDespite all the changes, Flipboard is not in need of raising funds to support its new developments. It\u2019s running off the profits of its own business as it moves in this direction.\nThe company is also betting on the fact that federated social media may only be the beginning of what\u2019s to come for the web overall.\n\u201cI saw what was happening with ActivityPub and it became very clear to me that this is the future of the web, period,\u201d McCue said. \u201cThe social web is people linking to pages and people linking to people. So it\u2019s a much more intricate web.\u201d\nHe sees Flipboard as a part of that opportunity. \u201cThere needs to be a way to do discovery and search and have it be beautiful and simple and easy to use. That is what we\u2019re focused on,\u201d McCue added.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-18 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":507}
{"title":"2023 in social media: the case for the fediverse","context":"## 2023 in social media: the case for the fediverse\n\nThere\u2019s this picture from more than a decade ago that still goes viral on the web every once in a while. You\u2019ve probably seen it: it was created by the venture capitalist Andrew Parker, and it compares a few dozen startups with subsections of Craigslist. Back then, Craigslist was all things to all people online, and a generation of startups figured they could do part of the job a lot better.\nSome of those companies failed \u2014 sometimes because of Craigslist! \u2014 but some also became gigantically successful. Airbnb worked because it was more searchable, reliable, and trustworthy than a random Craigslist listing; StubHub sold you secondhand tickets without the 50 percent chance those tickets were fake; Etsy offered a much more fun shopping and discovery experience than a bunch of text listings and crappy photos.\nFor a decade, startups tried to unbundle Craigslist. Now they can do the same for social networks. Image: Andrew Parker\nThis is the same opportunity in front of the social media landscape right now: a rare chance to unbundle the internet, to pull apart an existing system and rebuild it, piece by piece, in vastly better ways. If we do this correctly \u2014 if the next phase of how we congregate and communicate online is built for humans and not advertisers \u2014 there won\u2019t be a new titanic company to rival Meta or a platform with eye-poppingly huge numbers like Facebook. What we\u2019ll get instead is something much bigger: an entirely new infrastructure for our online lives that no company or platform controls.\nThe reason this suddenly feels possible is the emergence of the fediverse. In a sentence, the fediverse is an interconnected set of apps that can all read and write the same content. Decentralized social media is often compared to email, in that you don\u2019t have to compose, organize, and read your messages all in the same app, and you and I don\u2019t have to use the same tools to communicate. Email apps can have different interfaces, different privacy policies, even wildly different ideas about what email is for. Every app knows what an email address is, and every email address can talk to every other.\nThe point is that email is just data, and lots of apps can understand and manipulate it. When Meta\u2019s Adam Mosseri posts on Threads and you see it on Mastodon, that\u2019s the fediverse at work. If you post on Mastodon and I see it in my Pixelfed feed, that\u2019s fediverse too. When I comment on your Flipboard post and it shows up as a reply in the Mastodon feed you check through the Mammoth app? Pure fediverse, baby.\nI\u2019m convinced we\u2019ll be better off with a hundred different apps for Snapchat or Instagram or X instead of just one\nI\u2019m convinced we\u2019ll be better off with a hundred different apps for Snapchat or Instagram or X instead of just one, a dozen companies competing to build the best moderation tools, and an app store filled with different ways for me to follow and be followed by other people on the internet. It doesn\u2019t make sense that we have a dozen usernames, a dozen profiles, a dozen sets of fans and friends. All that stuff should belong to me, and I should be able to access it and interact with it anywhere and everywhere.\nThe infrastructure underlying all of this is typically ActivityPub, a decade-old protocol overseen by the World Wide Web Consortium (also known as the group more or less in charge of how the internet works). There are other similar protocols as well, like Bluesky\u2019s AT Protocol and Nostr and Farcaster. I\u2019d bet heavily that ActivityPub becomes the default choice over time, but ultimately, it doesn\u2019t matter so much which protocol wins as long as one of them does. We don\u2019t need two internets, and we don\u2019t need two social protocols. We need one thing that is both simple enough and big enough to handle all the ways we connect with each other online. No centralized platform has ever been big enough. The fediverse can be.\nMastodon is the biggest thing in the fediverse so far, but it may not be for long. Image: Mastodon\nDecentralizing social media can sound like a sort of kumbaya anti-capitalist manifesto: \u201cIt\u2019s about openness and sharing, not capitalism, man!\u201d In practice it\u2019s the opposite: it\u2019s a truly free market approach to social networking. Mastodon may not be interested in becoming a trillion-dollar company, but there\u2019s no reason there can\u2019t be plenty of those built on the fediverse. It\u2019s just that in a fediverse-dominated world, the way to win is not to achieve excellent lock-in and network effects. The only way to win is to build the best product.\nThis is really not a particularly hot take, by the way. Even the most successful centralized platforms have long understood that a protocol-driven social web is a good idea. Jack Dorsey used to say that Twitter was better as a protocol than a platform, and started the project that became Bluesky before also helping get Nostr going. (We really don\u2019t need to get into the whole story of what happened to Twitter since then, except to say that the speed with which that platform changed made a lot of people acutely aware that we need a social ecosystem that can resist the whims of a single company or CEO.)\nMeanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to earnestly believe that bringing Threads to the fediverse is a good idea, both for its product and for its business. \u201cNot everyone wants to use one product,\u201d he said to my colleague Alex Heath earlier this fall, \u201cand I think making it so that they can use an alternative but can still interact with people on the network will make it so that that product also is more valuable.\u201d Mark Zuckerberg! Said that! He understands that people want to feel like their social connections and content belong to them, not to a company that can disappear or pivot or change its ways. And let\u2019s be real: if Meta can\u2019t build and maintain the One True Social Network For Everybody, nobody can. It\u2019s well past time to try something else.\nThe only way to see your Facebook posts is to sign up for Facebook\u2019s rules, Facebook\u2019s aesthetic, Facebook\u2019s features, Facebook\u2019s moderation, Facebook\u2019s algorithm, and Facebook\u2019s business model.\nRight now, every social platform is a universe unto itself. The only way to see your Facebook posts is to sign up for Facebook\u2019s rules, Facebook\u2019s aesthetic, Facebook\u2019s features, Facebook\u2019s moderation, Facebook\u2019s algorithm, and Facebook\u2019s business model. That\u2019s not just a bad user experience, it\u2019s a ridiculous way to run a company. Facebook has to invent and maintain all these things, just as every one of its competitors does. It\u2019s an impossible task but just as impossible to compete with; you can\u2019t build social products without building an entire social graph from scratch, and good luck with that.\nIn a fediverse world, rather than try to build another all-encompassing Facebook from scratch, an enterprising developer can pick one or a few of its features and try to do better. Users can pick their favorite app \u2014 or two, or two hundred \u2014 through which to get their posts. Because everything is based on one set of posts and an open network of friends and followers, new social products can be useful even if you\u2019re the very first user.\nImage: W3C\nIn the world of ActivityPub, every post everywhere is made up of a sender, a message, and a URL. Every user has an inbox and an outbox for those messages. That\u2019s the whole protocol in a nutshell. The simplicity is the point: since ActivityPub is not a product but a data format like PDF or JPG, what you do with those messages, those URLs, those inboxes and outboxes, is entirely up to you.\nYou could have a Twitter-like app that emphasizes text, or an Instagram-like one with a UI that shows photos first. Your federated YouTube could be full of everybody\u2019s videos, or you could make TikTok by filtering only for short and vertical ones. You could use a WhatsApp-style messaging app that only cares about messages sent directly to someone\u2019s inbox.\nYou could try to do all those things, or you could try to do something nobody\u2019s ever been able to do before. You could build a news reader that only includes posts with links to news sites and automatically loads those links in a nice reading interface. You could build a content moderation tool that any fediverse app could use to filter and manage content on their platform. You could build the perfect algorithm that only up-ranks shitposts and good jokes, and license that algorithm to any app that wants a \u201cEpic Posts Only\u201d mode. You could build an app that\u2019s just an endless feed of great stuff for NBA fans. You could build one that\u2019s just for crypto true believers. You could build one that lets you swipe from one to the other depending on your mood.\nThere are already a few platforms built on ActivityPub and embracing the ideas of the fediverse. Apps like Mammoth and Ivory are showing the potential for different user experiences on top of the same data and infrastructure. But so far we\u2019re mostly in the \u201cpopular app, but federated\u201d phase of this transition. (Which is definitely better than \u201cpopular app, but blockchain\u201d from a couple of years ago\u2026 but not by much.)\nSo far we\u2019re mostly in the \u201cpopular app, but federated\u201d phase of this transition\nMastodon deliberately looks and feels like Twitter. (So do Firefish and Pleroma and GoToSocial and others. The fediverse is super into replacing Twitter.) Pixelfed is Instagram through and through. Lemmy\u2019s features are virtually all ripped straight from Reddit. Almost everything in the fediverse is a one-to-one competitor to an existing platform: PeerTube to YouTube; Friendica to Facebook; BookWyrm to Goodreads; on and on it goes. Some of these apps are very good! But nearly all of them are differentiated only in that they\u2019re federated.\nLet\u2019s be super clear about this: the point of the fediverse is not that it\u2019s federated. The most consistent argument against the long-term viability of platforms like Mastodon is that most people don\u2019t give a hoot about the underlying protocols and infrastructure of their apps and just want things to be easy, reliable, and useful. That is absolutely, unequivocally true. Making the \u201cIt\u2019s federated!\u201d argument is like making the \u201cIt\u2019s better for privacy!\u201d argument: it makes you feel good, and at best it\u2019s a useful tiebreaker, but it doesn\u2019t actually matter. All that matters is the product.\nThe best thing about the fediverse is that it will actually enable an explosion of better social products, for lots of reasons but one in particular: it allows for so many more of them. Forget the hand-wavy protocol stuff for a second \u2014 one of the best things about embracing ActivityPub is that it sticks a crowbar into a single Voltron-ic product like Facebook or Twitter or Snapchat and pries it apart into its component pieces, each one ripe for innovation and new ideas.\nWe\u2019re still in the very early days of the fediverse, and it\u2019s going to be messy for a while. It might feel like you\u2019re seeing the same posts too many times, and like you see some posts that obviously weren\u2019t meant to be seen in the app or feed you\u2019re using. Some particularly thirsty influencers are going to go hard on cross-posting tools that threaten to clutter up all your feeds everywhere and become totally unavoidable. This is not a problem with the protocols; it\u2019s an opportunity for better products. There\u2019s plenty of money to be made in the fediverse, and plenty of space for new products to take off.\n\nThis article, authored by David Pierce, was published by The Verge on 2023-12-19 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":508}
{"title":"The new American Dream is to get MrBeast to pay off your debt","context":"## The new American Dream is to get MrBeast to pay off your debt\n\nA woman in a blue tracksuit is on the floor of a bright asylum-like room, stretching in a pigeon yoga pose when she turns to the stranger she plans to live with for 100 days.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with this money?\u201d she asks. The two contestants in MrBeast\u2019s newest video, Suzie Taylor and Bailey Stanfield, have been cohabitating for nearly three weeks at this point, isolated from the rest of the world. They only eat canned food, and all they have to entertain themselves is a deck of cards that they made themselves.\n\u201cI was probably going to pay a lot on the house,\u201d Bailey replies. He\u2019s sitting in his bed, where he\u2019s made a canopy with a sheet to keep the light out, since the bright lights never turn off. Stacks of dollar bills lie atop his canopy, and he\u2019s surrounded by 15 more briefcases filled with money, which he will only get if he can stick this out for another few months.\n\u201cI want to pay off my parents\u2019 debt,\u201d Suzie says. \u201cThat would be like, my ideal world.\u201d\nTaylor and Stanfield successfully completed the challenge, winning $185,000 each. But what\u2019s intriguing about their reality TV-like experience is that this trade-off has become a new normal on social media. If you agree to suffer for content, you might just be able to pay off your parents\u2019 debt.\nThe most successful YouTuber in the world, MrBeast, is known for his expensive stunts. Four years ago, this meant paying people $10,000 to eat a ghost pepper, giving someone $100,000 to spend in one hour, or offering a stranger $100,000 to quit their job. With each video, MrBeast\u2019s challenges have become a bit more diabolical, pushing contestants\u2019 physical and mental fortitude to their limits. Now, starring in one of his videos means surviving in a locked room with a stranger for over three months, or living in a grocery store.\nA 25-year-old named Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, must constantly up the ante in every video to keep his massive audience entertained. Oftentimes, MrBeast is the one putting himself in these nightmarish situations, like when he buried himself alive for seven days (and while he was 10 feet underground in a coffin, he celebrated hitting the milestone of 200 million YouTube subscribers). But his contestants\u2019 goals have remained the same since the beginning. Americans are so saddled with debt \u2014 medical bills, student loans, mortgages, credit card interest \u2014 that it seems like the only way out is to sign up for a massively unpleasant YouTube stunt.\nOne of the 100 contestants in a video called \u201cLast To Leave Circle Wins $500,000\u201d cried when she earned a consolation prize of a few thousand dollars.\n\u201cThis is going to change my life,\u201d she said tearfully. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a lot of this to pay my bills.\u201d\nAnd Alex, the man who lived in a grocery store for 45 days, said he would set aside $60,000 of his winnings to pay off debt, $130,000 for his house and $60,000 for his two kids\u2019 college fund.\n\u201cMoney is the thing we\u2019d trade our life for,\u201d said contestant Shawn Hendrix in one MrBeast video, in which he lived in a giant circle in the middle of nowhere for 100 days, away from his wife and four children. \u201cI\u2019ve given up a third of a year of my life for half a million. Make sure you\u2019re trading your life for things that are worth it.\u201d\nThe situation is oddly reminiscent of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the Netflix series about 456 contestants who are so deeply in debt that they agree to fight to the death for the chance to win millions of dollars, all while the wealthy elite watch for sport. And, to be extremely on the nose, MrBeast created his very own Squid Game challenge, where 456 people competed for $456,000. Then, Netflix also created a reality competition show based on the dystopian thriller.\nOf course, the contestants on Netflix or in MrBeast videos are participating voluntarily and are not in mortal danger. Still, we\u2019re living in a country where the total amount of student debt has almost tripled in the last 15 years to over $1.77 trillion dollars. And according to a study from Kaiser Health News and NPR, 41% of American adults have some form of medical debt.\nIf getting sick can render you bankrupt, why not live inside a grocery store for 45 days if it could eliminate your financial burdens? The American Dream is no longer the promise that anyone can get rich if they just work hard enough. Now, it\u2019s the hope that maybe one day MrBeast will film you living in terrible conditions for a few months, and then you\u2019ll be able to pay off the debt you accumulated by simply just going to school or getting sick.\nOne of the two contestants who just won $185,000 for living in a barren room with a stranger for 100 days, Suzie Taylor is using this exposure to jumpstart her career as a content creator. Now that 78 million YouTube viewers (and counting) have watched her get pushed to her psychological limits for cash, she\u2019s reinvesting her winnings into becoming a content creator herself.\nIn tandem with the release of MrBeast\u2019s video about her, Taylor posted a video called \u201cI Spent $185,000 From MrBeast.\u201d Her video pays homage to MrBeast\u2019s old-school guerilla philanthropy videos, as she drives around Los Angeles doing good deeds for strangers. She buys a child a hoverboard at Target, she gives money to homeless people, and she pays for everyone\u2019s ice cream at a very crowded dessert shop. She\u2019s quite literally using the money she won from MrBeast to jumpstart her online career, wherein she\u2019s emulating the same playbook that made MrBeast who he is.\nTaylor\u2019s strategy is low-key genius. According to the Wayback Machine, she had 300 subscribers in April. On Sunday, December 17, the day after she and MrBeast posted their videos, Taylor had around 12,000 subscribers, and on Wednesday, December 20, she\u2019s broken 100,000. So, if Taylor can keep her subscribers engaged beyond her 15 minutes of fame, she won\u2019t just have won $185,000 from MrBeast. She\u2019ll have made a down payment on a whole new career.\n\nThis article, authored by Amanda Silberling, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-21 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":509}
{"title":"SoftBank Corp takes 51% of Cubic Telecom for $513M to drive into the connected car world","context":"## SoftBank Corp takes 51% of Cubic Telecom for $513M to drive into the connected car world\n\nAutomakers and technology companies are building ever-more sophisticated digital platforms into the future generations of cars and other vehicles. Today, a startup that\u2019s built a system to make it easy to connect that software and hardware to wireless networks has picked up a major round of funding.\nCubic Telecom, which provides a software-based networking solution for vehicles (and other devices) to link up with mobile networks in whichever country they happen to be, has picked up \u20ac473 million ($513 million at today\u2019s rates) from SoftBank Corp. SoftBank is taking a 51% stake in the Dublin-based startup, valuing it at just over $1 billion (\u20ac927 million).\nThis effectively makes Cubic Telecom a consolidated subsidiary of SoftBank. Barry Napier will stay on as CEO and will have a seat on the board of the company. Daichi Nozaki, SoftBank\u2019s SVP of global business, plus two other SoftBank-appointed people (still unnamed) will join the board, with the remaining three board seats occupied by existing Cubic Telecom investors, which include CARIAD (the Volkswagen Group) and Qualcomm.\nThe funding will be used to continue building out Cubic Telecom\u2019s technology and business. Today, it has partnerships with 90 national and multinational mobile network operators and provides connectivity to 17 million+ vehicles in 190 countries and regions.\nThat\u2019s only between 7% and 10% of the current market, Cubic Telecom COO Shane Sorohan said in an interview. (It might be actually slightly lower: Juniper Research estimates that the number of connected vehicles in the market today is around 192 million.)\nBut the size of this particular round is due to how fast the company is growing right now. Cubic Telecom is currently linking up 450,000 new vehicles \u2014 consumer cars, trucks and more \u2014 using its platform each month, and orders in the books are going to raise that rate \u201cexponentially\u201d over the next five years, the company said. Cubic Telecom cites forecasts from McKinsey noting that some 95% of new vehicles will be sold with wireless connectivity built into them by 2030. Juniper puts the number of new cars on the road by then that will be \u201cconnected\u201d at just under 400 million.\nGrowth in the industry is due to a few factors: networks continue to improve, in particular with 5G especially suited to IoT deployments; cloud-based data services and vehicles themselves are getting more advanced; and thanks to the evolution of other connected devices like smartphones, watches, televisions and so much more, consumers and business are expecting more functionality in their vehicles.\nTo be clear, Cubic Telecom\u2019s investment is coming from SoftBank Corp., not SoftBank Group, nor the company\u2019s storied Vision Fund, known \u2014 and occasionally notorious \u2014 for its outsized venture deals.\nIn this case, the Japanese telecoms and IT division in Tokyo is putting in the money as a strategic investment.\nThe pair have been working together in Japan, where Cubic Telecom has been integrating SoftBank\u2019s wireless network to provide connectivity to connected cars. And now, SBC sees an opportunity to expand internationally not through costly builds of more network, or by acquiring other carriers, but by taking a stake in a partner that it sees is getting strong traction as an IT partner globally precisely in that area where telecoms meets technology \u2014 a holy grail-type goal for carriers, especially these days as their networks become further commoditized.\nCubic plans to continue building more connectivity for vehicles, Sorohan said, but he added that the company\u2019s infrastructure and partnerships can work in a number of other verticals, such as the agricultural industry, where national and multinational companies are now using a multitude of connected tooling and autonomous equipment in remote areas.\nCubic Telecom\u2019s business goes back to before connected cars were a significant business \u2014 it actually appeared at TechCrunch\u2019s first-ever Battlefield in 2007, when it was focused more on helping consumers connect mobile phones to international networks when roaming. But it was its current focus on vehicles that turbo-charged the business, attracting investment from the likes of Audi and Qualcomm.\nThe bigger gap in the market that the company has been targeting and building to plug for the last several years has been that, while tech companies and automakers have been working on ways to build more functionality into vehicles \u2014 whether that be more clever ways to manage and respond to diagnostics on the vehicle, or give you an easier way to listen to Spotify, or to help drive a car altogether \u2014 the piece that has remained more tricky is the internet connectivity to make all of that work.\nTypically, car makers will have to cut deals with individual carriers region-by-region, which is time-consuming, costly and does nothing for creating a seamless experience at the front end for users, either. Cubic\u2019s platform acts as a wholesale aggregator, and it essentially helps to manage all of that automatically and at a lower cost, so that cars come delivered into a market ready to use, and if those cars are then driven into another region, they will continue to work there, too.\nAs vehicles continue to get more sophisticated, it\u2019s a fair bet that technology companies and automakers themselves will come up with more seamless ways themselves to manage that connectivity. Looking at what Apple and others are building with eSIMs is a sign of how there will be easier ways to provision services as easy as it is today for most people and businesses to install, or uninstall, software. But for now, the Cubic approach is one that is helping to bring down the cost of building and managing it, and that gives it a key role for some years to come.\n\u201cIn line with our \u2018Beyond Japan\u2019 strategic growth initiative, we are extremely pleased to be teaming up with Cubic Telecom to make a full-fledged entry into the fast-growing market for high-value IoT asset connectivity,\u201d said Junichi Miyakawa, president & CEO of SoftBank Corp., in a statement.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-05 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":510}
{"title":"A tale of two research institutes","context":"## A tale of two research institutes\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, once a year you get to put together a panel built on pure kismet. Pairing Gill Pratt with Marc Raibert was exactly that for me. The two go back several decades, to the salad days of MIT\u2019s Leg Lab.\n[A version of this story originally appeared in TechCrunch\u2019s robotics newsletter, Actuator. Subscribe for free here.]\nRaibert founded the lab at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 1980, before moving operations to MIT. The team was focused on robot locomotion research that would pave the way for Boston Dynamics\u2019 work.\n\u201cWhen we first got started, all robots that had legs were very slow moving, crab-like things that would hug the ground and then tentatively take a step and hope that things didn\u2019t topple over and then move like a slow-moving spider,\u201d says Raibert. \u201cI was interested in how animals work, and I looked at that and said, \u2018Wow, this is about as far from right as you can get.\u2019 I went the other way to see if we can do something where the dynamics and the energy in the machine [were] part of the story, and springs and bouncing were part of the story. My lab worked on that. We built pogo stick robots.\u201d\nRaibert ran the lab for 15 years. A number of future robotics luminaries would make their way through the program over the course of its existence, including AI ethics professor Joanna Bryson, research scientist Jerry Pratt, Wobbleworks co-founder Peter Dilworth, artist Daniel Paluska, CSAIL professor\/Toyota Research Institute (TRI) VP Russ Tedrake, UC Berkeley professor Ken Goldberg, Boston Dynamics CEO Rob Playter and Agility Robotics co-founder Jonathan Hurst, who was a visiting student from CMU one summer.\nRaibert and Pratt first crossed paths when the latter was a student at MIT. Raibert would found Boston Dynamics in 1992, handing the Leg Lab keys over to Pratt three years later.\n\u201cMarc was an incredibly generous professor,\u201d Pratt says of their early days. \u201cOne of the wonderful things about MIT at the time and Marc in particular is that I was this young kid, and both as a graduate student and then a young professor, he welcomed me. For a while, both of us were working in the Leg Lab at the same time, and Marc had done this extraordinary work on robots that run. I decided that maybe I would work on robots that walk. That\u2019s how we intersected then, and then when he went off to form Boston Dynamics, he was very kind and basically gave me the lab and all the stuff that was there.\u201d\nPratt remained in academia for the next two decades, transferring from MIT to Olin in 2001. Nine years later, he became a program manager at DARPA. It was there the two crossed paths yet again. Boston Dynamics designed Atlas for DARPA. The humanoid robot made its debut in 2013 and has since become a mainstay in robotics challenges.\nThree years later, Pratt was named TRI\u2019s CEO. Raibert continued as Boston Dynamics\u2019 CEO until 2019, handing the reins over to longtime employee Rob Playter, who managed the company\u2019s shift to more commercial pursuits. Last year, Raibert (who still serves as BD\u2019s chairman) founded the Boston Dynamics AI Institute. The organization has a lot in common with TRI. Both are dedicated to pure research, with the backing of two major automakers (Toyota and Hyundai).\nI recognize that \u201cpure research\u201d is a bit of a loaded term. The concept is certainly a hopeful one: finding a method that can sustain research outside of the pressures of academia and corporate R&D.\nAsked whether there is pressure from Toyota to productize, Pratt says, \u201cThere actually is not, and I\u2019m not saying that just to be nice. I think one of the great things about companies that have existed for long times is that this isn\u2019t the first time that they\u2019ve done R&D. Certainly most of the R&D budget inside of Toyota is spent figuring out how to make the next car or maybe the car five years from now. But there\u2019s this notion \u2014 and I\u2019m sure Hyundai shares this \u2014 that we\u2019re at the once-in-a-century time for transformation in the car industry. Battery electric vehicles are much simpler to make than cars have been in the past \u2014 no engine, no transmission, etc. So, we\u2019re going to have to compete in a much fiercer way in cars. But also, can we use the skills, the dreams and the hopes of the company to go beyond cars? TRI\u2019s job is to actually think about [what\u2019s] next. What\u2019s next after cars, as well as some fancy stuff on cars.\u201d\nFor TRI, much of the \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d focuses on supporting aging populations. The organization invests a good portion of its resources to building out technology designed to help older people live more independently. That\u2019s at the root of the research we shared from the institute last week. Noted senior research scientist Benjamin Burchfiel:\nWe\u2019ve seen some big progress with the advent of [large language models], using them to impart this high level of cognitive intelligence into robots. If you have a robot that picks up a thing, now instead of having to specify an object, you can tell it to pick up the can of Coke. Or you can tell it to pick up the shiny object, or you can do the same thing and do it in French. That\u2019s really great, but if you want a robot to plug in a USB device or pick up a tissue, those models just don\u2019t work. They\u2019re really useful, but they don\u2019t solve that part of the problem. We\u2019re focused on filling in that missing piece, and the thing we\u2019re really excited about now is that we actually have a system and that the fundamentals are correct.\nThe Boston Dynamics AI Institute is still in its infancy, and therefore doesn\u2019t have much in the way of public facing research to show just yet. It is, however, doing a lot of hiring. This week it announced that MIT\u2019s Kate Darling will lead research around \u201cethics and societal impact of robotics and AI.\u201d From the institute:\nDarling\u2019s team will explore immediate as well as long term questions on the implementation and use of robotics, impact on the workplace, infrastructure and other topics. The team will perform studies and experiments designed to generate data needed for others to make informed ethics and policy decisions, and will also develop a series of talks and workshops at the intersection of ethics, law, economics and robotics that will offer a platform for broad discussion.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard Gill say that making a car is taking small bits of metal and banging them up, welding them together and attaching them,\u201d Raibert says. \u201cThat\u2019s a little on the primitive side. Now we have software, robotics, AI and all that stuff, and the car companies need to embrace that. I think the leadership at Hyundai \u2014 the chairman visited me last week, and we\u2019re in close touch with him and the people who work with him \u2014 think that getting into the 22nd century is an important thing to do and we\u2019re getting started on it now.\u201d\nPratt adds, \u201cThere\u2019s actually this alignment that\u2019s happening between cars and robotics, as well. Rod Brooks was the one who a few years ago said that modern cars are eldercare robots. I think that\u2019s really true. You think about the amount of computers in them, the amount of software that\u2019s in them. TRI has different divisions inside of it, one of which works on very advanced things in cars that is completely overlapping with some of the software and some of the concepts that we\u2019re using in the robotics space.\u201d\nFor its part, the Boston Dynamics AI Institute lists three key pillars of its research: intelligence, dexterity and mobility. That\u2019s effectively making robots that are smarter, better at mobile manipulation and move more dynamically. Raibert admits that \u201cBoston Dynamics AI Institute\u201d might not be the most instructive name, both with regard to confusion between itself and Boston Dynamics the company, as well as a seeming focus on AI over robotics. A name change is apparently coming, but nothing has been decided just yet.\n\nThis article, authored by Brian Heater, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-01 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":511}
{"title":"World Series Game 2: Arizona Diamondbacks v Texas Rangers \u2013 live","context":"## World Series Game 2: Arizona Diamondbacks v Texas Rangers \u2013 live\n\n29 Oct 2023 03.21 GMT Final thoughts Okay, we officially have a series! Assuming one has no rooting interest in either of the remaining teams, there\u2019s no greater start to a World Series than a split in the first two games. A 1-1 split is an ideal situation for the casual fan as it usually portends a longer series. It is, of course, a less than ideal situation for the Rangers. Today, their weaknesses were exposed and they know their two-game home stand could have gone worse: they needed plenty of late-inning drama just to pull off a come-from-behind win in Game 1. What happens next is anybody\u2019s guess. The World Series heads to Arizona for Monday\u2019s Game 3 where Rangers\u2019 Max Scherzer and the Diamondbacks\u2019 Brandon Pfaadt are currently penciled in as the probable starters. Stay tuned to the Guardian for further coverage of the 2023 World Series as it develops but this will wrap up today\u2019s Game 2 liveblog. Thanks to everybody who followed along with us tonight. Ciao!\n\n29 Oct 2023 03.12 GMT Merrill Kelly Despite the final score, this was a much closer game until the Rangers bullpen imploded late. Arizona\u2019s big hero was starting pitcher Merrill Kelly who put up a dazzling pitching performance: 7.0 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 7 Ks. It even felt like he could have stayed in there longer if necessary. Easily the player of the game.\n\n29 Oct 2023 03.08 GMT The Arizona Diamondbacks win Game 2 The Arizona Diamondbacks, on the back of an impressive pitching performance by Merrill Kelly, have won Game 2 of the 2023 World Series! The series is now tied 1-1 heading to Arizona for Monday\u2019s Game 3.\nUpdated at 03.10 GMT\n29 Oct 2023 03.07 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, FINAL Garver\u2019s only goal here is to not make the final out of a World Series game. Luckily for him, Fr\u00edas puts him in a decent position by throwing him two straight balls to start the plate appearance. However, after two strikes, he lines out to third and, in fact, makes the final out of a World Series game. The Arizona Diamondbacks hold on to win!\n\n29 Oct 2023 03.04 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, bottom 9th Fr\u00edas can end the game right here, as long as he can get Garc\u00eda out. He falls behind 2-1, which would be worrisome if he wasn\u2019t working with an eight-run lead. Semien takes second on defensive indifference but he would have made it there anyways because Garc\u00eda eventually takes ball four. There\u2019s runners on first and second but the key stat remains the fact that there\u2019s two outs in the ninth inning.\n\n29 Oct 2023 03.01 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, bottom 9th Grossman looks at a Fr\u00edas ball to start his at-bat but three strikes later, he\u2019s out of there. The Rangers are down to their final out.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.58 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, bottom 9th Luis Fr\u00edas is coming into the game to get the final two outs for Arizona, possibly against Rangers pinch-hitter Robbie Grossman. Stay tuned.\nUpdated at 03.00 GMT\n29 Oct 2023 02.57 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, bottom 9th Seager is up next. He hits a long flyball that\u2019s caught in centerfield. The Rangers are down to their last two outs of Game 2.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.56 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, bottom 9th Saalfrank starts the bottom of the ninth, hoping to end this one as quickly as possible. Semien will lead things off here, although one imagines the Rangers are already looking ahead to Game 3. Semien hits a booming flyball that lands foul. He takes a ball and then fouls off the next pitch. 1-2. He then hits a ground ball that sneaks through the defenders for a single, his first hit of the game.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.52 GMT Two run single! (Rivera) Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, top 9th Rivera is up with runners on second and third but two outs. He drives in two runs with a single to absolutely ruin my pregame prediction. He gets thrown out on second to end the inning however. To the bottom of the ninth!\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.50 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 9th Thomas is up with two on and one out. He grounds out on two pitches, moving the runners into scoring position.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.49 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 9th Gurriel hits a single to centerfield, Peterson advances on the play.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.48 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 9th Jace Peterson is getting a pinch-hitting opportunity here for Arizona. It\u2019s kind of like a basketball game now here where the coaches empty out the bench. Peterson works a full count before hitting into a fielder\u2019s choice. Walker is erased on the play. So it\u2019s one down with Peterson on first.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.45 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 9th P\u00e9rez is back out there to pitch, essentially in mop-up duty now. He faces Walker, who hits a single to center. That\u2019s Walker\u2019s first hit of the World Series so good for him.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.41 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, bottom 8th That\u2019s two quick outs for the Diamondbacks, so Tavares is up to try to salvage anything here for Texas. He falls behind in the count 0-2, takes two pitches and grounds out to short. The Rangers challenge the play, but the call is confirmed. To the ninth inning!\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.38 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, bottom 8th Saalfrank gets Jung to ground out to third, sorry Jung lovers.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.37 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, bottom 8th Andrew Saalfrank is pitching now for Arizona as Kelly gets a well-earned rest. Rivera stays in the game, playing third base. Lowe is at the plate for the Rangers and he promptly grounds out to second.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.36 GMT Me earlier: \u201cI\u2019m going to guess this ends with a score like Diamondbacks 6-2 Rangers.\u201d If this holds up, I want to claim partial credit.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.34 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 8th Moreno strikes out on three pitches to finally end the inning, but the damage is done and this one feels all but out of reach for Texas. Still, the game must go on and we head to the bottom of the 8th inning.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.33 GMT RBI single! (Carroll) Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 8th Carroll singles here and scores Perdomo! The Diamondbacks are just teeing off on these relievers.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.31 GMT Two-run single! (Marte) Diamondbacks 6-1 Rangers Diamondbacks 6-1 Rangers, top 8th This is more like the Rangers bullpen I was expecting. Ketel Marte is up next with the bases loaded and a chance to make the rest of this game entirely irrelevant. P\u00e9rez\u2019s first pitch is yet another ball, this one that barely misses the ground. 1-0. Marte takes a huge swing and the next pitch, he doesn\u2019t make contact. However, on the next pitch, he knocks in a base hit that\u2019s a two-run, two-out single and the Diamondbacks have a five-run lead!\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.28 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th P\u00e9rez faces Perdomo who looks at two straight strikes. He fouls off a 0-2 pitch to stay alive before taking a ball. 1-2. He doesn\u2019t offer at another ball. 2-2. P\u00e9rez tries a sinker and doesn\u2019t get the call. 3-2. The crowd boos, it does look like a borderline pitch but P\u00e9rez isn\u2019t really showing great command. And, yeah, he throws another ball to walk the bases loaded.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.25 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th What if you appeared in a World Series game and didn\u2019t get a chance to hit? Well, it looks like Emmanuel Rivera is in to hit with P\u00e9rez in the game. Ah, managerial chess matches, how I loathe thee. Once again, that runner is still on second and there are still two outs. P\u00e9rez gets a strike on his first pitch to Rivera and then uncorks three straight pitches that aren\u2019t in the zone before Rivera swings and misses to make it a full count. He waits for the next pitch and takes a walk. So that\u2019s runners on first and second with two outs now.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.21 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th Oh hey, a rare Diamondbacks pinch-hitter. Welcome to the World Series, Pavin Smith! Meanwhile, Stratton is out of the game now and pitcher Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez is coming in.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.20 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th To be fair, that\u2019s not a terrible bunt, again it\u2019s a situation where one more run might put this one out of reach. It\u2019s also weird because Stratton doesn\u2019t seem sharp. He gets ahead of Thomas 0-2 and just can\u2019t put him away. Thomas works a full count and then starts to foul off fastballs to stay alive. On pitch number nine, however, Stratton gets him to look at a curve that just hits the corner for strike three. That\u2019s now two out with a runner on second. The announcers note that this was the first time an Arizona hitter struck out this game, which is maybe the number one reason why the Diamondbacks are in front.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.16 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th Gurriel Jr. is up next. He bunts and I\u2019m just getting sick of this. Pham is on second base with one out now.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.15 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th Chris Stratton is the next Rangers reliever. He has absolutely no room for error given that there\u2019s a huge difference between a three-run deficit and a four-run deficit. It\u2019s the entire basis of the archaic \u201csave\u201d rule! He\u2019s here to face Pham, who puts him to work by running up a full count on eight pitches before hitting a single to start of the top of the eighth. He\u2019s 4-to-4 on the day.\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.10 GMT In a world full of bullpen games and pitching \u201copeners,\u201d it\u2019s important that we recognize how rare it is for a starter to get this deep in a postseason game. Merrill Kelly is now the first pitcher to work seven innings in a World Series game in the 2020s. The last pitchers to do it were Stephen Strasburg (8.1 IP) and Gerrit Cole (7 innings twice) in 2019. \u2014 Tyler Kepner (@TylerKepner) October 29, 2023\n\n29 Oct 2023 02.09 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, bottom 7th Two out, nobody on in the bottom of the seventh. Heim is up to the plate for Texas and he gets ahead of the count 2-0 before looking at his first strike. 2-1. Kelly\u2019s next pitch is a ball, 3-1. Could this be a rare walk? Nope, Heim watches two straight strikes to end the inning. The Rangers have just six outs to play with to score three runs. Can they pull of late-inning magic again?\n\n\nThis article, authored by Hunter Felt, was published by The Guardian on 2023-10-28 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":512}
{"title":"From winter fun to summer sun: your seasonal guide to diverse Dubai","context":"## From winter fun to summer sun: your seasonal guide to diverse Dubai\n\nSynonymous with all things luxury paired with a rich history and heritage, Dubai has plenty to offer the traveller looking to immerse themselves in culture while also enjoying the finer things in life. A year-round destination, this diverse country offers a wide range of activities and experiences that vary depending on the time of your visit.\nOver the winter months, Dubai enjoys balmy temperatures and pleasant weather throughout the season, making it the ideal time to get outdoors and explore it\u2019s more active, adventurous side. While in early summer, as the temperatures climb, it\u2019s the perfect spot for a blend of beach breaks and sightseeing. Finally, in the hotter months, June and July, its world-famous waterparks come into their own, while air-conditioned cultural activities and evening tourism (where you sight-see after sunset) are other season-perfect options.\nFor a stress-free start to your Arabian adventure, when you book with British Airways Holidays, you can enjoy great value breaks, with the quality and peace of mind you expect from British Airways. ATOL-protected, keeping you and your money safe, you can enjoy flexible payment options with deposits from just \u00a375 per person* as well as 23 kg baggage allowance per person and 24-hour dedicated support helpline during your trip. Meaning, whatever time of the year you travel there, from the day you book, you can put all your focus on planning an unforgettable trip to this dynamic, luxurious corner of the world.\nA winter escape\nFrom desert safaris to quadbiking, head to the Dubai desert for a big adventure (Alamy Stock Photo)\nIf you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019d rather spend their days exploring than soaking up the sun on the beach, then November and December is the best time to head for Dubai and get stuck into outdoor activities. The temperature, although still hot with clear blue skies, is a lot cooler than the sweltering summer months.\nDubai\u2019s desert offers a wealth of heart-pumping Arabian activities to enjoy, from dune buggies to quad biking and desert safaris. Whizz through the desert on a heart-pumping dune drive, keeping your eyes peeled for local wildlife along the way \u2013 the desert is home to hopping gazelles, several species of reptile and the Arabian Oryx, a species that was saved from the brink of extinction. If you choose a desert safari, you\u2019ll also experience traditional activities like henna tattooing and dance shows; many also culminate in an evening BBQ dinner.\nThe winter months are also a great time to explore Dubai\u2019s fascinating history. At Dubai Creek in Deira, you\u2019ll find traditional wooden boats, also known as abras, the oldest form of public transport in Dubai. These boats will take you from one side of the river to the other \u2013 a short trip, but it\u2019s a nice way to get a feel for local life in Dubai.\nConsider a stop-off in the historic Al Fahidi Historical neighbourhood located along the creek, where you can learn what life in Old Dubai was like. The area is dotted with original buildings and preserved infrastructure like traditional wind towers and the Al Fahidi Fort, one of the oldest buildings in Dubai, built back in 1787.\nMore history and heritage can be found in nearby Hatta, where craggy mountains and lush valleys cradle citadels, towers and forts. For jaw-dropping views over the historical village, hike up the dramatic Hajar mountains, one of the highest ranges in the Arabian peninsula. Be sure to stop by Hatta Heritage Village, a reconstruction of a traditional mountain village, where you can see how life was lived centuries ago.\nIf you do happen to visit in November, Dubai Design Week takes place around the start of the month. The region\u2019s largest creative festival shines a spotlight on pioneering designers and all things creative via exhibitions, installations, talks, workshops and markets.\nBeach clubs and festivals\nDubai\u2019s blue skies, turquoise seas and golden shores are made for sunseekers (Alamy Stock Photo)\nMay is also a great time for a trip to Dubai, particularly for sunseekers, with average temperatures around 30 degrees. Make the most of dining al fresco; the city is filled with beachside eateries and outdoor terraces. At Akira Back, which serves Japanese dishes prepared with Korean and international flavours, you can enjoy incredible views across Dubai Marina from its huge terrace. Or try Fish Beach Taverna, for must-experience Aegean seafood in coastal setting.\nWhether you fancy soaking up the day\u2019s rays in a luxury cabana or floating in an infinity pool overlooking the surrounding sea, there\u2019s no shortage of beach clubs to get your sunshine fix in style. Melt into a cosy daybed at S\u0100N Beach or head to DRIFT Beach Dubai for infinity pool rest, relaxation, and chic French fare.\nFoodies should coincide their trip with The Dubai Food Festival, the ultimate celebration of the local culinary scene, held at the beginning of the month. While for those looking to add some culture to the mix, the Dubai Comedy Festival takes place later in May, bringing together some of the best names in comedy for some side-splitting entertainment.\nSplash parks and sunset cruises\nEvery month brings opportunities to explore something different in Dubai, and that\u2019s no exception as temperatures begin to climb in June and July. These sun-packed months are perfect for those who really like the heat and are happy to spend their days cooling off by the water.\nFor literal thrills and spills, Dubai has made a name for itself when it comes to water parks. Wild Wadi, as the city\u2019s first-ever waterpark, is a perennial favourite for adults and kids alike, with its exhilarating range of rides, surfing machines and wave pool. There\u2019s also Laguna Waterpark, one of the newer parks on the map, located on the coast with an infinity pool and its own beach, as well as thrilling slides and a boat-themed kids pool.\nVisiting in hotter months means you can save sightseeing and cultural activities for night-time, giving you an entirely different way to experience the city. Take an evening dinner cruise along Dubai Creek to experience the twinkling city night lights, or head up the iconic Burj Khalifa at sunset for stunning views across the city.\nFurther architectural highlights include the night-time lights of the Burj Al Arab and the Dubai Frame, a 153-metre-high structure built to resemble a massive picture frame, which provides incredible views of Old and New Dubai. Alternatively, make the most of the air-con, with indoor concerts and theatre shows at the stunning Dubai Opera.\nDiscover dynamic Dubai with British Airways When you book with British Airways Holidays, you can enjoy great value breaks, with the quality and peace of mind you expect from British Airways. ATOL-protected, keeping you and your money safe, you can enjoy flexible payment options with deposits from just \u00a375 per person, with no balance due until 4 weeks before travel for short haul, or 7 weeks for long haul*. Customers can also use Avios to pay for flights and part-pay holidays.\nA generous baggage allowance of 23kg per person is included \u2013 so you won\u2019t encounter any add-on costs.\nBritish Airways Holidays provide 24\/7 support throughout your trip, with a dedicated holiday helpline for any issues whilst you\u2019re away.\nWhether you\u2019re looking for some winter sun, a springtime break or your next big getaway, to find your perfect holiday in Dubai, visit British Airways for destination inspiration and incredible deals on flights and hotels.\n*Terms and conditions apply.

Let\u2019s jump in with a few words about Tesla.\nAh, but before Rebecca goes . . . it\u2019s me, Kirsten, popping in here to share a bit of what I saw and experienced at Rebelle Rally 2023, a 2,120-kilometer off-road and navigation competition. In its eighth year, the Rebelle has become a proving ground of sorts for the 65 all-women teams who participate as well as stock manufacturer vehicles. The catch? GPS and other electronic devices are strictly prohibited.\nSo what am I checking out at this seemingly non-tech event? EVs and tech, of course. Oh, and green hydrogen, believe it or not.\nThere were 10 vehicles out of the 65 that fell into the electrified category such as the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 4xe. Four of those vehicles \u2014 all of them Rivian R1T pickups \u2014 were electric. And this year, one Rivian team took first place in the 4\u00d74 class (there are two classes in the Rebelle) \u2014 the first time an all-electric vehicle was on the top podium. The first place finishers, driver Lillian Macaruso and navigator Alexandra Anderson, are both employees of Rivian.\nOK, Rebecca, back to you.\nTesla reported its third-quarter earnings this week, and once again, all eyes were on the automaker\u2019s margins amid ongoing price cuts.\nTesla\u2019s shares, which are priced more as a tech stock than as an automaker\u2019s stock, were down after Q3 earnings. Investors were clearly feeling skittish after Tesla reported a gross margin of 17.9%, down from 25.1% in the same period last year. That\u2019s also down from Q2\u2019s margins of 18.2%. As a result, profits fell 44% to $1.85 billion in Q3 from the same year-ago period.\nInvestors see the falling margins and Tesla\u2019s price cuts as proof that demand is lessening for the vehicles as other EVs take market share and rising interest rates make it difficult for many buyers to afford big ticket purchases. The company also reported that solar deployments slipped 48% in Q3 from the same period last year. But the company made up for it by pulling in a 90% spike in energy storage deployments.\nTesla also gave some updates about its long-delayed Cybertruck. Initial deliveries are set for an event at Giga Texas on November 30. Elon Musk noted that scaling the Cybertruck will be hard and it will take 18 months before the pickup is profitable.\n\u201cI mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck,\u201d said Musk.\nThe billionaire executive also said Giga Texas will be able to produce about 250,000 Cybertrucks a year starting in 2025. But let\u2019s remember that Musk isn\u2019t great at making predictions. After all, he initially said the Cybertruck would be on the market by 2021. Expect some of these numbers to be pushed out, too.\nWant to reach out with a tip, comment or complaint?

Here are some of the best bits that came out of it:\nBird is now doing e-bikes again? But instead of the VanMoof knockoff of previous years, Bird has partnered with TradeHubb, an e-bike supplier, and Spring, a strategic retail growth company, to launch the bike. You might recall that Bird last year ditched its retail bike offering to focus on shared rides in an attempt to reach profitability. The struggling company was also recently delisted from the stock market. Who knows what\u2019s going on behind the scenes? I tried reaching out to learn more, but no response. If you have a tip, hit me up!\nThe team at Ride Review launched the Rider\u2019s Choice Awards again, for those who want to vote. Winners will be announced January 25.\nThe folks behind Micromobility America also launched the Electric Rider Alliance, a 501c6 membership organization that is set up to \u201ccreate a level playing field in the transportation industry for the small electric vehicle ecosystem through standards, lobbying and governance.\u201d\nIn other news . . .\nBolt Mobility is introducing distance-based pricing for some of its micromobility vehicles. The aim here is to incentivize riders to slow down and ride more safely, rather than racing the clock.\nAn e-scooter that looks like a Cybertruck? Check out Infinite Machine\u2019s first product, the P1, which is on sale now.\nMeet Shane, a two-wheeled EV concept space-pod-looking thing from the creator of the original hoverboard, Shane Chen.\nDeal of the week\nKirsten here again! Convoy isn\u2019t a traditional deal of the week, but its collapse sure got my attention.\nThe digital freight broker told employees this past week it was shutting down due to what executives described as a \u201cmassive freight recession.\u201d It turns out that disrupting the freight business is hard.\nThe abrupt closure, which wiped out investors, comes about 18 months since the Seattle-based company raised $260 million in fresh funding that pushed its valuation to $3.8 billion.\nI went back and read an interview TechCrunch conducted with Convoy co-founder and CEO Dan Lewis. A few things he said stuck out, namely what led him to start the company in the first place. The former Amazon and Google executive, who has a background in strategy and management consulting, told TechCrunch that when he was struck by the urge to start a company, he researched the money-attracting industries of the world, and then, using AngelList, saw how many companies were trying to disrupt those industries.\nHere\u2019s the nugget:\nHis search yielded thousands of companies that were working on industries ranging from telecommunications and fashion to video games and food. Billions of dollars were going into trucking each year but fewer than 30 startups showed an interest in the field.\n\u201cI saw a massive opportunity and few people going after it,\u201d Lewis told TechCrunch.\nAnd then later, when asked if his method of deciding on a direction for a startup is still a good method, Lewis said, in short, yes. Read the whole interview from May 2022 here.\nOther deals that got our attention . . .\nHayden AI, an AI and geospatial analytics company, raised $53 million in a Series B funding round led by the Drawdown Fund. The company\u2019s tech is being used by government agencies to enforce traffic violations that obstruct transit buses and capture data to help increase ridership and improve traffic efficiency.\nCommercial fleet insurance startup Nirvana Insurance has raised a $57 million Series B to expand its big data platform, hire new staff and grow its business in the trucking industry. Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round, with General Catalyst and Valor Equity Partners also participating. The round doubles Nirvana\u2019s valuation to more than $350 million post-money.\nSupply chain logistics company Transfix raised a $40 million Series F. The company is backed by New Enterprise Associates, G Squared and Canvas Ventures.\nEV charging company Wallbox has acquired the operations and assets of German-based EV charging solutions company ABL for \u20ac15 million. Together the plan is to deploy more than 1 million chargers globally.\nVolta Trucks filed for bankruptcy proceedings in Sweden as difficulties with suppliers proved a hindrance to raising funds. Volta said the bankruptcy in August of Proterra, an EV parts supplier, and the uncertainty over its own battery supplier means it needed to cut down the number of trucks it could produce. Volta, which is based in Sweden but has operations in the U.K., also said it would file for bankruptcy in Britain.\nNotable reads and other tidbits\nAutonomous vehicles\nCruise, General Motors and Honda are launching a robotaxi service in Japan under a new joint venture. The service will launch with Origin vehicles in Tokyo in 2026.\nSpeaking of Cruise, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened an investigation into the GM subsidiary\u2019s AV system following several incidents involving pedestrians in San Francisco. The most recent one left a woman stuck under a Cruise robotaxi after being hit by a human-driven vehicle.\nFoxconn and Nvidia are building \u201cAI factories\u201d to help accelerate AVs, robotics and other smart applications. The AI factories position the two against Tesla, which is building the Dojo supercomputer to do more or less the same thing \u2014 take in vast amounts of data, train it, tweak code and send it back out to self-driving cars.\nWaymo released a lightweight simulator called Waymax for the AV research community. The simulator is designed to train multiple agents to perform complex, realistic behaviors.\nElectric vehicles, charging & batteries\nBMW Group says it will adopt the NACS charging standard in the U.S. and Canada. Drivers of BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands will gain access to Tesla Superchargers in early 2025, and in that same year, BMW says it will implement NACS in EVs sold in the U.S. and Canada across those same brands.\nSpeaking of NACS, global EV charging network ChargePoint has officially opened its AC and DC piles and is now deploying NACS connectors across its network.\nGeneral Motors is delaying its $4 billion plan to convert the Orion Assembly plant into an EV truck factory to late 2025 amid softening EV demand and, we\u2019re guessing, the ongoing UAW strike.\nKia has started taking reservations for its EV9 full-sized SUV. Reservations are $750 and can be applied to the purchase of the company. This is one of the first vehicles Kia has allowed customers to reserve in advance.\nLucid missed Wall Street delivery estimates in the third quarter by about 500 vehicles. The automaker delivered 1,457 of its luxury Air sedans, reporting flat growth year-over-year. The results sent shares down as investors worried about softening demand for Lucid\u2019s only EV.\nCalifornia-based EV startup Pebble unveiled a prototype of its flagship all-electric travel trailer. The $100,000 EV is designed to support a digital nomad looking to get lost in the wilderness \u2014 it can live off-grid for seven days.\nCommercial EV startup REE Automotive has reported an order book that now totals $25 million for its modular battery EV platforms, dedicated to B2B customers.\nAbout 10,000 of Rivian\u2019s all-electric vans are delivering packages throughout the U.S. for Amazon.\nTesla has urged the Biden administration to adopt stricter fuel economy standards than the NHTSA has proposed. Most other automakers have already said the NHTSA\u2019s proposal was unfeasible, so Tesla\u2019s call on regulators to double down seems to be yet another way the EV maker can one-up its competitors.\nToyota has also joined the NACS bandwagon. The automaker will build certain Toyota and Lexus vehicles from 2025 onward with an NACS port.\nFuture of flight\nEVTOL company Archer Aviation plans to start air taxi operations in Abu Dhabi in 2026.

{"title":"MVPs for all 16 AFC teams at the midpoint","context":"## MVPs for all 16 AFC teams at the midpoint\n\nOf the 16 AFC team MVPs at the season's midpoint, five are quarterbacks. At least two of them should be in the running for league MVP after the season. Meanwhile, a wideout who might be on his way to the greatest individual season at the position is his team's MVP through nine games. Here are Yardbarker's team-by-team MVPs. (Find Yardbarker's NFC team MVPs here.)\nAFC East\nBUFFALO BILLS | QB Josh Allen: Allen probably won't finish in the top three of NFL MVP balloting as he did last season, but his value to the Bills is immeasurable. Through nine games, he is on pace to set a career-high in completion rate (71.3%) and tops all QBs in QBR (75.3). Allen has virtually carried the offense by himself, accounting for 24 of the team's 28 offensive touchdowns.\nMIAMI DOLPHINS | WR Tyreek Hill: Arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL, Hill has somehow reached a new level of dominance in his age-29 season. The seven-time Pro Bowler leads the NFL in receiving yards (1,076) and TD catches (eight). As long as the Dolphins maintain their success on offense down the stretch, Hill should earn Offensive Player of the Year honors. He's on pace to break Calvin Johnson's season record for receiving yards (1,964).\n\nNEW YORK JETS | LB Quincy Williams: While his brother, Quinnen, may be the better-known Jets defender in the family, Williams \u2014 the AFC Defensive Player of the Month for October \u2014 is also making a name for himself. Aside from being the fifth-highest-rated linebacker in the NFL by Pro Football Focus, Williams is tied for 17th in tackles (74) and tied for ninth in TFLs (nine) among all defenders.\nNEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS | S Jabrill Peppers: There hasn't been much to get excited about in New England, but the versatile defensive back is a bright spot and a respected voice in the locker room. Peppers has 54 tackles \u2014 three for loss \u2014 one interception, one forced fumble and a team-leading six passes defended. For a team facing as many uncertainties as the Patriots are, Peppers is a solid piece to build around in the short term. \u2014 Colum Dell\nAFC West\nDENVER BRONCOS | CB Patrick Surtain II: In eight games, the 23-year-old budding star has one interception and eight passes defended, tied for 11th in the NFL. Don\u2019t be surprised if he earns a second straight Pro Bowl nod.\nKANSAS CITY CHIEFS | QB Patrick Mahomes: A shaky receiving corps hasn\u2019t fazed Mahomes. He\u2019s third in the NFL in passing yards (2,442), fourth in TD passes (17) and third in QBR (73). The 28-year-old might capture his third MVP, as oddschecker notes he\u2019s favored to win the award again.\nLAS VEGAS RAIDERS | Defensive end Maxx Crosby: Despite a weak supporting cast, Crosby thrives. He has 9.5 of the Raiders\u2019 24 sacks and is tied for the league lead in tackles for loss (13). If the two-time Pro Bowler keeps dominating, he will generate more Defensive Player of the Year buzz.\nLOS ANGELES CHARGERS | WR Keenan Allen: The 31-year-old is the centerpiece of the offense and leads the team in yards receiving (720) and receptions (62). Through Week 9, Pro Football Focus gave him a receiving grade of 84.6, eighth among WRs. \u2014 Clark Dalton\nAFC North\nBALTIMORE RAVENS | QB Lamar Jackson: Jackson has inserted himself into the league MVP conversation during his team\u2019s four-game win streak. The 2019 NFL MVP has thrown for 1,954 yards and nine touchdowns and posted 440 yards and five touchdowns rushing. He is the reason, once again, Baltimore is a Super Bowl contender.\nCLEVELAND BROWNS | Defensive end Myles Garrett: Garrett could be leading the race for the Defensive Player of the Year. The No. 1 overall pick in 2017 is tied for the second-most sacks (9.5) and most forced fumbles (four) in the league. He also blocked a field-goal attempt in a Week 7 win over the Colts. He's the ringleader of a defense that allows the fewest yards per game (234.8).\nCINCINNATI BENGALS | QB Joe Burrow: Battling a calf injury, Burrow had a rough start to the season. He appears fully recovered now, though, as the Bengals (5-3) have won four straight. During their win streak, Burrow has thrown for 1,133 yards, 10 touchdowns and just two interceptions.\nPITTSBURGH STEELERS | Linebacker T.J. Watt: The Steelers are the first team in NFL history to be outgained by their opponents in each of their first eight games and have a winning record (5-3). It hasn\u2019t been pretty to watch, but Pittsburgh always makes plays when needed. The player who seems to make the most is Watt. The 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year is tied for second-most sacks (9.5) in the league. He also has two forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and one interception. \u2014 Aaron Becker\nAFC South\nHOUSTON TEXANS | QB C.J. Stroud: Stroud is having one of the best statistical rookie seasons of all time. He ranks in the top 10 in passing yards (2,270), touchdown passes (14) and passer rating (102.9), and has only thrown one interception. The Texans (4-4) aren\u2019t close to a .500 team without him.\nINDIANAPOLIS COLTS | RB Zack Moss: With Jonathan Taylor missing the first four weeks of the season, Moss stepped up in a big way. After not playing in Week 1, he rushed for 445 yards and scored four touchdowns over his next four games to help Indy win three of four and stay in the thick of the AFC South. Moss is second in the NFL in rushing, 37 yards behind San Francisco's Christian McCaffrey.\nJACKSONVILLE JAGUARS | RB Travis Etienne: QB Trevor Lawrence hasn\u2019t quite taken the step forward everyone thought he would, but fortunately for the Jags, Etienne is emerging as one of the top RBs in the league. He has rushed for multiple touchdowns in three of his past four games and scored a touchdown in five of the team\u2019s six wins. Etienne ranks third the NFL in rushing touchdowns (seven) and sixth in rushing yards (583).\nTENNESSEE TITANS | DT Jeffery Simmons: There haven\u2019t been too many bright spots for the Titans, but Simmons continues to be a wrecking ball on the defensive line. He leads the team in tackles for loss (six) and ranks second in sacks (4.5).

He\u2019ll both leave the company\u2019s board of directors and step down as CEO.\nIn a post on OpenAI\u2019s official blog, the company writes that Altman\u2019s departure follows a \u201cdeliberative review process by the board\u201d that concluded that Altman \u201cwasn\u2019t consistently candid in his communications\u201d with other board members, \u201chindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\u201d\nTip TechCrunch\nDo you work at OpenAI and know more about Sam Altman\u2019s departure?\nDo you work at OpenAI and know more about Sam Altman\u2019s departure? Get in touch with TechCrunch\n\u201cThe board no longer has confidence in [Altman\u2019s] ability to continue leading OpenAI,\u201d the blog post reads.\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Altman wrote that he \u201cloved his time at OpenAI\u201d and will have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d\ni loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what\u2019s next later. \ud83e\udee1 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 17, 2023\nOpenAI\u2019s dramatic leadership change will also see Greg Brockman \u2014 who was a member of the team that co-founded OpenAI, as was Altman \u2014 step down as chairman of the board but remain as OpenAI\u2019s president, reporting to the company\u2019s newly-appointed interim CEO, Mira Murati. Murati was previously OpenAI\u2019s CTO.\nOpenAI says that it\u2019ll begin conducting a formal search for a permanent CEO immediately.\n\u201cOpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity,\u201d the board wrote in a joint statement. \u201cThe board remains fully committed to serving this mission. We are grateful for Sam\u2019s many contributions to the founding and growth of OpenAI. At the same time, we believe new leadership is necessary as we move forward. As the leader of the company\u2019s research, product, and safety functions, Mira is exceptionally qualified to step into the role of interim CEO. We have the utmost confidence in her ability to lead OpenAI during this transition period.\u201d\nSam Altman is a hero of mine. He built a company from nothing to $90 Billion in value, and changed our collective world forever. I can't wait to see what he does next. I, and billions of people, will benefit from his future work- it's going to be simply incredible. Thank you\u2026 \u2014 Eric Schmidt (@ericschmidt) November 17, 2023\nOpenAI\u2019s board of directors now consists of OpenAI\u2019s chief scientist Ilya Sutskever; Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo; tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley; and Helen Toner, the director of strategy at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\nAltman\u2019s removal comes unexpectedly, to say the least. The company just last week hosted its first developer conference, OpenAI DevDay, which Altman emceed. Altman spoke at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference and an Oakland, California event on Thursday. And according to The Verge and The New York Times, citing multiple internal sources, OpenAI employees learned of Altman\u2019s firing when it was announced publicly.\nAltman has a long history steering OpenAI. After co-founding the company alongside Peter Thiel, LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman and others, Altman, who formerly headed startup accelerator Y Combinator and also holds a seat on the board at Worldcoin, the ambitious cryptocurrency project, initially served as a co-chair of OpenAI alongside Elon Musk. Musk left in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest with Tesla.\nAltman over the past several months played an active role in attempting to shape regulators\u2019 responses to AI, appearing at U.S. congressional hearings and meeting personally with world leaders including President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron, among others, on an international policy tour.\nMore important than being one of the most brilliant and impactful people our industry has ever had Sam is one of the most generous and caring people I know. I've never met someone who has supported and lifted up more people around them than him. Couldn't be a prouder brother. \u2014 Jack Altman (@jaltma) November 17, 2023\nIt\u2019s unclear what missteps Altman might\u2019ve made helming OpenAI\u2026 at present. But they evidently relate to his relationship with OpenAI\u2019s rather unusual board makeup and corporate governance structure \u2014 and perhaps OpenAI\u2019s active talks to raise substantial new capital.\nAs a recent piece in VentureBeat explored, OpenAI\u2019s for-profit subsidiary, OpenAI Global, LLC, is fully controlled by OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit. While the for-profit subsidiary is permitted to commercialize its tech, it\u2019s subject to the nonprofit\u2019s mission: attaining artificial general intelligence (AGI), or AI that can \u2014 as OpenAI defines it \u2014 \u201coutperform humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d\nThe nonprofit OpenAI\u2019s board has the power to both determine when the company has achieved AGI and exclude this AGI from IP licenses and other commercial terms, including with Microsoft, one of OpenAI\u2019s biggest investors and a steadfast integrator of OpenAI\u2019s various technologies.\nMicrosoft has poured $13 billion into OpenAI so far and has what amounts to a 49% stake in the company. The former\u2019s stock price fell more than 1% in the last 30 minutes of trading, after Altman\u2019s departure was announced; Axios reports Microsoft was notified Altman would be leaving \u201cminutes\u201d before the public announcement.\nOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, but restructured in 2019 as a \u201ccapped-profit\u201d company to raise capital \u2014 an acknowledgement of the huge costs associated with training cutting-edge AI systems. Underlining the point, Altman said in an interview this week with the Financial Times that he \u201choped\u201d Microsoft would increase its investment to help pay for \u201chuge\u201d imminent model training costs.\nWhen contacted via email, OpenAI\u2019s press relations declined to comment beyond the official blog post. But Microsoft PR gave this statement from Frank Shaw, its chief communications officer: \u201cWe have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers.\u201d\nNadella later published a statement:\n\u201cAs you saw at Microsoft Ignite this week, we\u2019re continuing to rapidly innovate for this era of AI, with over 100 announcements across the full tech stack from AI systems, models and tools in Azure, to Copilot. Most importantly, we\u2019re committed to delivering all of this to our customers while building for the future. We have a long-term agreement with OpenAI with full access to everything we need to deliver on our innovation agenda and an exciting product roadmap; and remain committed to our partnership, and to Mira and the team. Together, we will continue to deliver the meaningful benefits of this technology to the world.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Wiggers, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-17 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":516}
{"title":"YouTube demonetizes popular content creator SSSniperwolf after doxxing accusations","context":"## YouTube demonetizes popular content creator SSSniperwolf after doxxing accusations\n\nThe debate over \u201creaction\u201d content on YouTube has been brewing for years, but a recent incident between two creators has refueled the urgency of the conversation.\nThe debate centers on Alia \u201cSSSniperwolf\u201d Shelesh, a YouTuber with over 34 million subscribers, and Jack \u201cJacksfilms\u201d Douglass, a YouTuber with 4.9 million subscribers. The two have been feuding online over the past year, but it came to a head this weekend, as Douglass said that Shelesh showed up to his home and filmed the outside of his residence on Saturday. Shelesh shared a video of the incident as an Instagram story, saying \u201clet\u2019s talk like adults,\u201d according to a report from NBC News. On Oct. 20, YouTube said that Shelesh\u2019s account would be temporarily demonetized.\nWhat led to this confrontation, and why did it ignite such a firestorm of controversy online?\nWhat is \u2018reaction content\u2019 and why is it so controversial?\nReaction content is an umbrella term that applies to a content creator responding to or riffing on an existing piece of media. Reaction content has been controversial for a long time; in 2016, the Fine Brothers made an infamous attempt to copyright their \u201cReact\u201d videos, which was met with near unanimous criticism. In August, the conversation reignited as popular creators like F\u00e9lix \u201cxQc\u201d Lengyel \u201creacted\u201d to long-form content with very little (if any) original input or transformative commentary.\nHow are Jacksfilms and SSSniperwolf involved in the reaction content debate?\nDouglass has made content on YouTube since 2006, primarily focusing on comedy videos. In the past, he has called out \u201creaction\u201d content that he says fails to meet the bar for fair use, and has even made parody videos reacting to reaction content.\nWithin the last year, he set his sights on Shelesh\u2019s content, citing a lack of credit or links to original creators and their work, and a lack of transformative commentary. Shelesh has been a content creator for roughly a decade, including making YouTube and TikTok videos. Her recent work is largely reaction content, which she posts to both platforms. Shelesh has been aware of Douglass\u2019 commentary, even making jokes about the YouTuber in her own reaction content.\nIn addition to Douglass\u2019 video callout above, he revived an old joke channel called JJJacksfilms, poking fun at Shelesh\u2019s content and celebrating times she deleted clips. He also regularly made content on Twitch reacting to and even grading Shelesh\u2019s reaction content, complete with a bingo game for viewers to play. The JJJacksfilms streams were designed to apply pressure to Shelesh, encouraging her to credit original creators and provide substantial commentary.\nThe SSSniperwolf doxxing accusations\nOn Oct. 13, Shelesh posted an Instagram story with the text, \u201cShould I go visit @Jacksfilms? He lives 5 mins away from my shoot.\u201d She proceeded to add more posts to her story throughout the night, which included a photo of the outside of Douglass\u2019 house and the caption \u201cLet\u2019s talk like adults.\u201d\nDouglass was livestreaming on Twitch when Shelesh posted these images to her Instagram story, and he disconnected and posted the following tweet on Oct. 13: \u201cSssniperwolf just doxxed me on her IG. Creepy, gross, violating,\u201d wrote Douglass, alongside a screenshot of Shelesh\u2019s Instagram story. \u201cWhat you do is disgusting. You steal content AND stalk youtubers. @YouTube demonetize this dangerous \u2018creator\u2019 or just get her off your platform. She posted an IG story right outside our home and deleted it.\u201d\nAs Douglass\u2019 fans waited for YouTube to respond, they scoured Shelesh\u2019s content, looking for potential additional rule violations. Shelesh also posted updates making light of the situation, including a since-deleted photo of her and her sister with the caption \u201cWe show up to ur house wyd??\u201d and a post over Douglass\u2019 tweet, captioned: \u201cThis creep has been harassing me for months then plays victim saying I threatened him when I just wanted to talk to him. I have no ill intentions. It\u2019s so sad when people have to constantly create drama to pay their bills.\u201d\nThe incident inspired a series of videos and posts from influencers and commentary channels, with public opinion largely being in favor of Douglass. Of course, the situation also inspired a fair few shitposts and memes \u2014 some of which were aimed at YouTube, encouraging the platform to respond.\nPolygon reached out to Douglass, Shelesh, and YouTube and will update this story when we hear back.\nYouTube responds\nOn Oct. 20, a week after the doxxing incident, YouTube and Shelesh both made public statements. YouTube posted a tweet confirming Shelesh had received \u201ca temporary monetization suspension per Creator Responsibility policies.\u201d The tweet also criticized \u201cthe behavior on both sides\u201d and expressed hope that the incident would \u201cmove this convo to a better place.\u201d\nConfirming SSSniperWolf has received a temporary monetization suspension per Creator Responsibility policies. Off platform actions that put others\u2019 personal safety at risk harm our community & the behavior on both sides isn\u2019t what we want on YT. Hoping everyone helps move this\u2026 \u2014 TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) October 20, 2023\nShelesh also made a statement on X, apologizing to \u201cJacksfilm, YouTube, the entire creator community, and my incredible fans for not being a better example of conflict resolution.\u201d She has since posted a handful of new videos to her YouTube account, with the comment sections disabled.\nThe response from both YouTube and Shelesh failed to address many fans\u2019 concerns, considering the official comment from YouTube spoke about \u201cboth sides,\u201d implying responsibility on Douglass\u2019 side of the conflict. The demonetization feels like a slap on the wrist, which has only inspired further commentary among the community. It seems like, for now, YouTube is content to avoid the debate around reaction content and simply profit off of it from afar.\n\nThis article, authored by Cass Marshall, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-25 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":517}
{"title":"Cell phone shocker as 97% of kids use their device during school hours and beyond, says study","context":"## Cell phone shocker as 97% of kids use their device during school hours and beyond, says study\n\nMobile phones just might be young people's best friend, whether their parents like it or not.\nA new study from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group in San Francisco, California, researched phone usage among a diverse group of 203 kids aged 11 to 17 \u2014 and the results were startling, experts say.\nThe researchers found that smartphones have become a \"constant companion\" for young people, according to a news release, although results varied.\nKids spent a median of 4.5 hours per day on their phones, with the maximum amount of time reaching 16 hours, according to the study.\nPHONE CALL ETIQUETTE FOR TODAY: BEST TO \u2018OPT FOR A TEXT MESSAGE,\u2019 EXPERT ADVISES\nMost teens check their phones frequently, ranging from two to 498 times per day.\nAdolescents were more likely to check their phones over 100 times a day, the study found.\nA whopping 97% of kids used their phones during school hours, while nearly 60% used them overnight \u2014 between the hours of midnight and 5 a.m. \u2014 on school nights.\nSocial media such as Instagram and Snapchat took up most screen time, at 32% during the school day, followed by YouTube and gaming, the study found.\nKEEPING KIDS SAFE: 'WAIT UNTIL 8TH' PLEDGE AIMS TO EMPOWER PARENTS TO RESIST SMARTPHONES FOR CHILDREN\nOvernight phone use was primarily spent engaging with the same media, although YouTube appeared to be the longest-running app because videos were often left playing during the night.\nTeens spent an average of 20 minutes per night on their phones, while some spent up to five hours.\nSixty-seven percent of participants picked up their phones on school nights, but the median number of pickups per night was only once.\nMore than 50% of kids get 237 notifications per day \u2014 while some receive as many as 4,500 every day, according to Common Sense Media's findings.\nAbout 23% of these notifications occurred during school hours.\nThe largest share of notifications came from apps including Snapchat and TikTok.\nYOUNG PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO FALL WHILE TEXTING AND WALKING AT THE SAME TIME, STUDY SAYS\nIn particular, TikTok was used by half of the study participants, for nearly two hours per day on average.\nCompared to other social media apps, teens were more likely to spend several hours daily on TikTok, with some scrolling on the app for up to seven hours.\nComparatively, the longest amount of time spent on Snapchat and Instagram was about three hours daily, the study found.\nOf the 85 participants under age 13, 68% used social media and had at least one app rated \"teen\" or higher \u2013 allowing access to \"age-inappropriate experiences,\" the study suggested.\nTikTok was the most popular app used by kids aged 11 and 12, while nearly half (45%) of participants used apps with mature or adult-only ratings, such as porn sites, fantasy sports and betting apps, according to the study findings.\nUNDERAGE DRINKING DANGERS: THESE ARE THE STATES WITH THE HIGHEST RATES OF TEEN ALCOHOL USE, STUDY FINDS\nMore than two-thirds of all participants admitted they sometimes or often find managing their use of technology difficult \u2014 or that they use it to escape \"sorrow\" or \"negative feelings.\"\nThey also said they've missed sleep due to being on their phones at night.\n\"People feel good and are enhanced by interactions with others \u2026 Those feelings cannot be replicated by connecting through a phone.\"\nLicensed clinical social worker Jennifer Kelman in Boca Raton, Florida \u2014 who provides expert advice on the Justanswer platform and was not involved in the study \u2014 shared some of the negative repercussions of kids spending large amounts of time on their phones.\n\"They lose the ability to have face-to-face interactions, and to converse and connect with others,\" she said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\"The phones and all the apps aren\u2019t real-life interactions, and there is beauty in connecting with others face-to-face that is lost,\" Kelman went on.\nKids also lose out on developing problem-solving skills, since they aren't typically tasked with negotiating \"tough spaces\" or navigating human challenges, the expert added.\nBACK TO SCHOOL: TIPS FOR HOMESCHOOLING THE KIDS AS MORE PARENTS DITCH CLASSROOMS\n\"The more apps we use, the more likely it is that we lose parts of ourselves, our confidence and self-esteem,\" said Kelman.\n\"People feel good and are enhanced by interactions with others, and those feelings cannot be replicated by connecting through a phone.\"\n\"Kids' brains aren\u2019t fully developed, so they aren\u2019t able to sniff out who is safe on the other end of the chat or the game.\"\nKelman warned parents that smartphone usage triggers the same dopamine release as drugs, as apps are designed to \"reel kids in and keep them hooked.\"\n\"[Parents] are the \u2018drug dealer\u2019 in this analogy, so please think twice before free rein is given,\" she said.\n\"Withdrawal is common as well, so be prepared for a lot of pushback when you try to limit the use of their phones and other tech devices,\" Kelman warned.\nThe therapist's biggest rule for cracking down on daily phone usage among kids is to delay phone access for as long as possible.\n\"Parents are giving their kids phones at young ages and kids are hooked quickly,\" she said.\n\"Forget what friends are doing \u2014 and delay this as long as you can,\" she advised.\nIf a cell phone is necessary due to schedules and after-school activities, a kid-safe starter phone like a Pinwheel could be a better alternative, Kelman suggested.\n\"It's a phone that lets parents manage and monitor their usage, but there is no internet and only specific, parent-approved apps that can be turned on and off at will,\" she said.\n\"Better for your child to have a little FOMO [fear of missing out] than to have access to porn, become a victim of sextortion, or lose the ability to truly connect with other people.\"\nKelman stressed that kids \"can\u2019t unsee what they have already seen,\" and that many adult apps may put kids \"in harm\u2019s way.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"Kids' brains aren\u2019t fully developed, so they aren\u2019t able to sniff out who is safe on the other end of the chat or the game,\" she said.\n\"Kids are coerced into sending photos of themselves, often finding themselves victims of sextortion after they share the photos,\" the expert warned. \"This leads to shame, despair and fear of telling their parents.\"\nParents should vet and monitor all content accessed by their kids, Kelman advised.\nCertain types of content are more harmful than others, noted Shelley Delayne, parent education director at Pinwheel in Austin, Texas, who was also not involved in the study.\nThese include \"attention-mining apps,\" adult images and interactions, user-generated content and \"invisible influences\" that can impact children's worldview, she said.\n\"Take it slow and give them only what they need,\" Delayne recommended.\n\"Delay the introduction of adult online spaces and social media to [age] 16 or older, and stay involved in their digital lives just as much as you are in their physical life.\"\n\"We interpreted this data with assistance from an advisory council of young people to understand the nuanced relationships that young people develop with their smartphones.\"\nShe also said, \"Remember that just because a kid can tap around on a device and make it do stuff doesn't mean they have all the skills they need to be unharmed by it.\"\nIn its report, Common Sense Media said it used \"software to collect data from the smartphones of a diverse group of about 11- to 17-year-olds. We then interpreted this data with assistance from an advisory council of young people to understand the nuanced relationships that young people develop with their smartphones.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt also provided additional context, noting the study was done with \"Android phone users only, because Apple device tracking does not share with the research community the names of specific non-Apple apps that young people commonly use.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to the group for further comment.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-10-01 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":518}
{"title":"The best portable chargers for your gear","context":"## The best portable chargers for your gear\n\nIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement .\nYour time \u2014 and money \u2014 is precious. Polygon\u2019s What to Buy has rounded up the best in gaming hardware, entertainment, tabletop, merch, and toys, and how to get them for the best value, so you spend less time shopping and more time enjoying.\nA power bank, also commonly referred to as a portable charger, is an essential purchase for anyone who\u2019s on the go with a phone, tablet, or a gaming handheld like a Nintendo Switch or a Steam Deck. It lets you recharge your precious gadgets one or more times via a USB connection, so you can keep talking, texting, or gaming throughout the day.\nPower banks range in price depending on a few factors: how compact it is, what kind of ports it has, how much battery capacity it contains (typically measured in mAh), and how quickly it can recharge your devices.\nBest portable charger for your phone and tablet\nToday\u2019s phones and tablets may differ in terms of their peak wired charging speeds, yet we\u2019ve found some battery packs that should work well no matter what device you have. It\u2019s true that some outliers, like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S23 phone, can recharge at 25 W or higher depending on the model, but many other Android phones and iPhones recharge via a wired connection at under 20 W \u2014 even less when you\u2019re charging wirelessly.\nHow to pick the best power bank\/portable charger for you Get one that lists the Power Delivery capability (noted as \u201cPD\u201d in the specs), and it should ideally match, or come close to, the peak charging speeds (in watts) of the devices that you intend to charge with it. The batteries we recommend for phones and tablets are also a good pick for the Nintendo Switch. However, the Steam Deck needs more juice, as do some mightier laptops that can receive power via USB-C.\nIn terms of tablets, picking either of the two power bank options we recommend below should be a good fit for what you may have. For reference, all iPads currently ship with 20 W power adapters, and so far, tablets from other manufacturers like Samsung and Amazon haven\u2019t deviated far from that charging speed.\nWhichever you choose, it never hurts to get some extra USB-C-to-USB-C cables. You can get this two-pack at Amazon for $15.99, so you can keep one at home and then put the other in a bag you bring around during everyday travels.\nBest power bank for your Switch\nThe Nintendo Switch console with detachable Joy-Cons can receive a maximum of 18 W through its USB-C charging port (the Switch Lite is slightly less demanding). So, the very same compact power bank we recommend for phones and tablets can be used to charge your Switch.\nSame note as before: We suggest buying more charging cables than you\u2019ll immediately need (stow one permanently in the bag you frequently use). You can get this two-pack of 100 W-ready, six-foot-long, USB-C-to-C cables at Amazon for $15.99.\nRelated The best Nintendo Switch accessories\nBest power bank for your Steam Deck\nEach Steam Deck console includes a 45 W USB-C wall adapter, so it\u2019s a good idea to find a power bank that can meet that power level when you\u2019re on the go. Thankfully, some options exist that can do this. One thing to note during your search is that only batteries that support the PD 3.0 spec, including the two options below, can recharge the Steam Deck at its fastest speed.\nRelated The best Steam Deck accessories\nBest portable charger for your laptop\nThe number of laptops that can recharge via USB-C is growing, making it possible to use the same charger to refill your laptop as you do your phone or Nintendo Switch. For instance, Apple\u2019s entire MacBook lineup allows it, as do several popular Windows laptops, like the Dell XPS 13, Razer\u2019s Blade gaming laptop, and more. The thing is, different laptops have different power requirements, so one power bank may not work well across multiple laptops.\nIf you have a 13-inch MacBook Air or Pro, or a similarly sized Windows laptop, the chances are very good that a 65 W power bank should be fast enough to recharge your laptop as you use it (check your power supply\u2019s wattage to be sure). Keep in mind that if you\u2019re trying to play games, or do other resource-intensive tasks, your battery may recharge slowly, or it may continue to discharge if your power bank isn\u2019t powerful enough.\nFor more powerful laptops, there are bigger, more powerful batteries to match that can supply up to 140 W of recharging power. That\u2019s currently a top-of-the-line spec, costing significantly more than our other options, and you\u2019ll even need a compatible USB-C-to-USB-C cable to reach the 140 W top speed, as well as a laptop that supports the PD 3.1 USB-C charging spec.\nOne of the chargers we recommend below can match the speed delivered by Apple\u2019s 140 W wall charger that\u2019s included with 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops. On the Windows side of things, most laptops don\u2019t go above 90 or 100 W at peak USB-C recharging speed, so you should be set with our picks.\nIt might be tough to justify spending $100 to $150 on a power bank just to charge a laptop. I get it. However, it\u2019s easier to justify getting one if you frequently travel with multiple power-guzzling devices that you\u2019d like to recharge simultaneously, as these are but a few available that can manage multitasking.\nUpdate (Nov. 17): Checked prices and stock for accuracy.\n\nThis article, authored by Cameron Faulkner, was published by Polygon on 2023-11-17 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":519}

Set a reminder to cancel it if you aren't interested in subsequent charges.\nThe Echo Studio is the best-sounding Alexa speaker, but it's also pretty expensive. This price matches a low we've seen just once before. It has more powerful sound in general, but the changes are especially noticeable on the low end. Check out our Best Smart Speakers guide for additional details and recommendations.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nThis matches the price we saw in July for the best Kindle for kids. It's waterproof and has adjustable warm lighting for reading at night. If your kid is really into the Warrior Cats books, there is a special edition just for them for $120. The standard Kindle Kids is also on sale and it's a bit cheaper at $80 ($40 off), but it lacks the adjustable warm lighting and waterproofing. Whichever you get, Amazon throws in a protective case, a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+, and a two-year no-questions-asked replacement guarantee.\nThe other Kindles are more affordable, so there's no practical reason to spend the cash for the Oasis. But if you're like me and love physical page-turn buttons, you may want to consider this one. We think it's probably due for an update soon though.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nIf you like to take digital notes, the Kindle Scribe (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first of Amazon's e-readers that lets you write on the enormous 10.2-inch screen like a regular notebook. However, if you want to write in the margins of books, you'll have to settle for using sticky notes. That's frustrating given the point of spending this kind of money is to write on it (marking up books is better on the Kobo Elipsa).\nPhotograph: Amazon\nThe Fire Max 11 (5\/10, WIRED Review) is Amazon's biggest, nicest, and most overpriced Fire tablet. This deal makes it much more palatable. The display and new fingerprint sensor are nice, as is the ability to use the keyboard without resorting to Bluetooth, but the Fire OS operating system leaves much to be desired (like a decent app store). Still, if you're set on a Fire tablet and you want a big display, this isn't a bad deal.\nBest Prime Day Laptop and Accessory Deals\nMacBook Air Photograph: Apple\nThe 2023 MacBook Air (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite laptops this year. It has an excellent six-speaker sound system, a 1080p front-facing webcam, and a 10-core variant of the M2 processor the previous year's model came with. It's blazingly fast for most normal work and can even handle some light video editing and other heavier tasks.\nThis is last year's 13-inch MacBook Pro (7\/10, WIRED Review) with the M2 chip and Touch Bar. It has the same processor that's in the new MacBook Air (our top pick for most people) and doesn't offer any major hardware upgrades except for a fan, which allows the processor to get a little warmer and eke out more power over a longer period of time. This helps if you\u2019re working on pro-level tasks like video editing but can\u2019t spend the premium that Apple charges for its bigger Pro models.\nThe Razer Blade 14 earned an 8\/10, WIRED Recommends award in our review. It has a gorgeous 16:10 display, plenty of USB ports, a full-size HDMI output, and an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti, with the option to upgrade to the 40-series, giving it plenty of power to tear through the toughest games. It's the laptop WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft used through Starfield's launch weekend; it has proven its worth already.\nPhotograph: Das Keyboard\nYou may have to click on \u201cSee More Buying Options\u201d to see this deal. The Das Keyboard MacTigr pairs well with Apple's laptops and PCs. It has a dedicated Mac layout, Cherry MX Red switches, a two-port USB-C hub, and a high-quality, all-metal build. It rarely goes on sale.\nThis is our favorite external keyboard in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. It's a great option if you're a fan of the Magic Keyboard and are looking to fully replicate your MacBook setup. However, this version is fairly bare-bones\u2014it doesn't come with a Touch ID button or the same function row keys as the M-series MacBooks (that model isn't on sale, sadly). But it does come with the standard keys like playback controls, a Mission Control key, as well as a number pad. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this keyboard, so far.\nThe Studio Display (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) has a spacious 27-inch display that's perfect for juggling multiple apps at the same time and a 5K resolution that's stunningly sharp (there's no HDR though, so colors look slightly more contrasty and saturated compared to the neutral tones on Apple's Pro Display XDR). Although it's pricey, this is an excellent monitor for those who want a really accurate and sharp screen. Equipped with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers, it's ideal for video calls too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, yet.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nOne of our top picks from our building your own PC guide, AMD's 16-core behemoth is a killer CPU for high-end 4K or 144-Hz gaming. It has some special requirements. It gets so hot there's no way you should put it into a PC without a liquid cooler like the Asus ROG Ryujin II Liquid Cooler.\nPlugable's USB-C Triple Display Docking Station is a great choice, especially for anyone using more than one monitor. It supports up to three displays at once (either HDMI or DisplayPort for each). The dock also packs six USB 3.0 ports (two on the front, four in the back) and a gigabit Ethernet port. Whenever you come back to your workstation with your MacBook, all you have to do is plug it in and you instantly have a multi-monitor setup. With an output of up to 60 watts, you can use the dock to charge your laptop too.\nClaiming the top spot in our Best USB Flash Drives guide, the SanDisk Extreme Pro balances speed, reliability, and price. The sleek aluminum case has a loop for attaching it to a keyring and a slider to push out the USB-A plug. It is fast, performs reliably (we've been using one regularly for two years), and comes with a lifetime warranty.\nBest Prime Day Tablet Deals\nPhotograph: OnePlus\nThe OnePlus Pad (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the few Android tablets we think is a worthy iPad alternative. It offers good performance, has great battery life, and an excellent 144-Hz, 11.6-inch LCD display. We strongly recommend OnePlus\u2019 magnetic keyboard, which is also on sale for $100 ($50 off), however, if you purchase directly from the company's website, you can get the keyboard bundled for free.\nThe 9th-gen iPad (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite iPad for most people, even though it's one generation behind. Aside from costing less than the current 10th-gen model, it is still compatible with the same accessories as the first-gen Apple Pencil. It retains the physical Home button with Touch ID at the bottom of the screen.\nPixel Tablet Photograph: Google\nGoogle's Pixel Tablet (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) is part tablet, part smart display. It comes with a charging dock that doubles as a speaker, so you can pump out the tunes and get answers from Google Assistant at a moment's notice. Take it off the charger and you get a full Android tablet experience.\nBest Prime Day Watch Deals\nPhotograph: Apple\nThe 2nd-generation Apple Watch SE is our top pick for most people. It's the most affordable of what Apple touts as its first carbon-neutral products (when bought in conjunction with the new sport loop, that is). It's compatible with WatchOS 10, which is where many new health and wellness features show up.\nThe second-generation Garmin Epix Pro holds the title of Best Outdoor Watch in our Best Fitness Trackers guide and is one of our favorite sports watches (8\/10, WIRED Recommends). It has a bright AMOLED display, battery life that can last through a week of camping, and useful features like redshift mode (for training outside at night), and a flashlight. There's also an endurance feature, in addition to all the other Garmin proprietary metrics that assess what kind of shape you're in. This deal applies to the 51-mm size, but the 42-mm and 47-mm sizes are also on sale.\nWe liked (but didn't love) the Withings Move smartwatch when we tried it. One of our chief complaints was its lack of heart rate monitoring, but that's an issue the Withings Steel HR has resolved, adding this crucial feature to what was already an elegant, subtle smartwatch. It has typical analog watch hands, with a smaller monochrome display for basic data, and it won't buzz your wrist all day with every single notification.\nGot an Android phone? We really liked using the TicWatch Pro 5, mostly because its battery stands out among competitors like Google, Samsung, and Apple. We easily get three days of average use, and Mobvoi\u2019s unique dual-display technology lets you stretch the battery life even further. It\u2019s powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 chipset, which is a newer and more efficient processor. And we've barely seen any hiccups operating this Wear OS 3 watch.\nBest Prime Day Phone Deals\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Photograph: Samsung\nSamsung's new Galaxy Z Flip5 (7\/10 WIRED Recommends) delivers a larger cover screen, which means you can do more on the phone without having to open it up. If you or someone you know always complain about how big phones are these days, a folding flip phone might be the answer to those woes. If you want to try a different style of flip phone, the Motorola Razr+ is also on sale for $800 ($100 off).\nPhotograph: Samsung\nDon't want to pay much for a phone? This is one of the best you'll find for the price (8\/10, WIRED Recommends). It lacks wireless charging (see the Pixel 7A below if you really want it), but the AMOLED screen has a 120-Hz screen refresh rate, the performance is decent, and the cameras are reliable. The battery also lasts more than a day.\nGoogle Pixel 7A Photograph: Google\nThis is our favorite smartphone for most people (8\/10, WIRED Recommends), and this is an incredible price (and the lowest we have tracked). It has smooth performance, a nice bright screen, excellent cameras, and even features like wireless charging. The battery life is just OK.\nWe have a lot of other good cheap phone recommendations here, but this Motorola is fine and performs well for the money. It will only get one OS update (to Android 14), but it will get three years of security updates. It comes with an NFC sensor so you can make contactless payments, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. Read our Best Motorola Phones guide for more.\nOnePlus 11 Photograph: OnePlus\nThe OnePlus 11 (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) is fast. The performance is fast, the recharging is fast. It even looks fast. It has a bright, 120-Hz AMOLED screen, great speakers, and surprisingly good battery life for all that. Our main gripe is the IP64 water- and dust-resistance rating, which is not nearly as good as other flagship phones.\nUgreen's charger is, as the name suggests, a 145-watt charger with a 25,000-mAh battery. It's surprisingly compact for the power it provides, although at 1.1 pounds, it's definitely not ultralight. There are two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. What sets the Ugreen apart is that you can actually draw 145 watts while charging. That works out to one USB-C port at 100W and the other at 45W. Very few other batteries we've tested are capable of that feat.\nPhotograph: Anker\nThe Anker Nano is one of our favorite portable power banks, particularly for phones. It clicks right into the bottom of your device, and even comes in fun colors. This model has a 12-watt Lightning connector but there is a 22.5-watt USB-C version for the iPhone 15 or Android phones for $22 ($10 off). Both connectors fold away when you aren't using them. If you use a particularly thick case, this may not work. You'll likely be able to charge most phones fully once before needing to recharge the power bank itself via the included USB-C cable.\nWe are big fans of the Backbone One (8\/10, WIRED recommends) and it appears in our Best Mobile Game Controllers guide. It slides open to cradle your phone and is very responsive, with buttons and bumpers that feel nice and clicky. The USB-C version that is on sale will work with most Android phones and the new iPhone 15 range.\nThis 2-in-1 charger is featured in our guide to the Best MagSafe Accessories. The price matches the lowest we have tracked. It doesn't have a built-in Apple Watch charger, but it can top off your compatible wireless earbuds whilst simultaneously charging your iPhone. It charges at the maximum 15-watt rate, and you can turn your iPhone sideways for iOS 17\u2019s new StandBy mode, converting it into a bedside alarm clock.\nAnker 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Charging Dock Photograph: Anker\nAnker makes our favorite lists often, including with this super compact 3-in-1 wireless charger. A MagSafe pad charges iPhones up to 15 watts at a slanted angle, and on the side is a standard Apple Watch puck (no fast-charging support). In the space inside the triangle is where you can place your AirPods Pro (or any other wireless earbuds case) to top them up.\nThis 2.5-inch cube from Anker is a great compact charger. It comes with a MagSafe pad on top (that charges at up to 15 watts), a top section that hinges to a 60-degree angle to reveal a charging surface for your AirPods, and a shelf on the side that has a built-in Apple Watch charger (which can comfortably accommodate any Apple Watch including the Ultra). You'll also get a 5-foot cable and a 30-watt charger in the box. It supports fast charging too.\nAnker 737 Power Bank Photograph: Anker\nWe just added this power bank as our top upgrade pick in our guide to the Best Portable Chargers. It's pricey, but today's deal makes it more accessible. It charges from zero to completely full in an hour and boasts a whopping 24,000-mAh capacity. And it's powerful enough to charge laptops and tablets as well as phones and other gadgets. There's even a built-in display to monitor stats like temperature and remaining battery percentage.\nThis heavy metal brick is a good option for charging laptops and smaller gadgets. It packs 20,000 mAh and supports a wide variety of fast charging standards. There is one USB-C PD port rated at 65 watts, two USB-A QC ports at 30 watts apiece, and a micro-USB input (though you are best using the USB-C to recharge it). We haven't seen it go on sale very often.\nThis travel kit from ESR works well if you want something that can prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. It can also display your Apple Watch in Nightstand mode, so you can peek and see how long before you must get out of bed. The main body folds open with a MagSafe charging pad for your iPhone and a slot behind for your AirPods. We have seen this dip a little lower, but this is still a solid deal.\nThe unusual design of Satechi's fold-up wireless charging stand allows it to charge both phones and a wireless earbuds case (if it supports Qi wireless charging), plus a USB-C port to plug in a third device\u2014not bad for a device that fits in your bag. It has a 10,000-mAh capacity with LEDs to show how much juice is left. The downside is that it is slow, offering up to 10 watts of wireless charging power for phones (7.5 watts for iPhones), 5 watts for earbuds, and 10 watts from the USB-C port.\nBest Prime Day Headphone Deals\nPhotograph: Sony\nWhile its predecessor was one of the best pairs of wireless earbuds around, the WF-1000XM5 (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) is still no slouch. They produce balanced sound, are comfortable to wear, and have active noise cancellation. When using the ANC, they last up to eight hours on a single charge, stretching to around 12 hours without it.\nThis deal is a match of historic low pricing that we don't see come around very often. The Google Pixel Buds Pro (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) are truly excellent earbuds\u2014particularly if you have an Android phone. They're comfortable and available in a wide array of colors at this price.\nThis is an invite-only deal (read more about that below). The Jabra Elite 7 Active top the list of our favorite workout earbuds. They came out in 2021, but are still the smallest, with the teeniest case, and the most comfortable we've tried. The rubber tip kept these securely in our ears while running, even while under a beanie that was rubbing against them. You can customize the level of ambient noise you let in via the Sound+ app, and they're IP57-rated to withstand sweat. You'll get 8 hours of battery life and up to 30 hours in the case.\nPhotograph: Apple\nIf you have an iPhone, these are the best earbuds. The newer USB-C model (8\/10, WIRED Recommends), has redesigned audio infrastructure, and remains to have some of the best noise canceling and microphones we've heard on a pair of earbuds.\nAnker's Space A40 earbuds (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) are packed with features for the price, with noise canceling, wireless charging, and 10 hours of battery life. Plus, they sound good, are lightweight, and comfortable to wear, which is why our reviewers say they nearly give Apple's AirPods a run for their money. Anker's Liberty 4 NC earbuds (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) are another feature-packed pair of buds with great noise canceling, and are on sale for $80 ($20 off).\nThe Beats Studio Pro (7\/10, WIRED Review) were released just a couple of months ago. We wish the battery life was longer and that the controls and EQ options were more robust. But this price makes them more worthwhile, and they do have excellent noise canceling.\nPhotograph: Bose\nThese noise-cancelling headphones are our favorite for the office. With advanced signal processing and four microphones built in, these will limit any sound around you, making them great for focusing on work in a busy environment and for Zoom calls. These often fluctuate in price, but we think it's a great deal.\nWe like Sony's standard LinkBuds (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) for the open-ear design that allows you to hear what's going on around you. If you do a lot of city walking, or use your earbuds somewhere that it's important to be aware of your surroundings, like while feeding lions at the zoo, then these are a great option.\nThese are our favorite workout headphones for running and biking\u2014any sport where you have to be aware of traffic but still want to listen to podcasts. They also fit under a helmet and have a decent 10-hour battery life.\nBest Prime Day Kitchen Deals\nPhotograph: Vitamix\nThe Vitamix 5200 is a staple on wedding registries, but, turns out, you can just buy them too. Like WIRED contributor Joe Ray, I was never really a blender person, but the Vitamix changed that. Whether you\u2019re blending smoothies, soups, or sauces, this mixer is powerful and durable. It's not cheap (even on sale), but it's worth it.\nIf you want a Vitamix, but don't want to shell out for the 5200, the Explorian is a good, cheaper alternative. This is the brand's entry-level blender, but it still has a powerful two-horsepower engine that will reduce the toughest nuts to a creamy paste.\nThe NutriBullet Smart Touch Blender comes with a 1,500-watt motor base with a 64-ounce pitcher. It features a locking lid with a spout and includes a tamper for pushing down ingredients while you blend. There's also a good selection of presets, like a pur\u00e9e setting, one for soups, one for frozen drinks, and one for smoothies.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nIf you\u2019re looking to save on counter space, the KitchenAid Artisan Mini is better suited to smaller kitchens and households. The full-size, 5-quart version is also on sale for $380 ($60 off).\nSous vide cooking is a great way to stop overcooking your food. It's a handy addition to any kitchen, and the Nano 3.0 is one of our favorite starter precision cookers.\nThis AeroGarden goes on sale all the time, but the price is right. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe said it was super easy to use. Simply place the seed pods in their corresponding holes, keep the bottom filled up with water, and wait. Just keep in mind that the light is bright\u2014this model would not be ideal in a studio apartment. And it'll grow herbs like crazy, which is a blessing or a curse depending on how much dill you can use in a given week.\nPhotograph: Zojirushi\nZojirushi's rice cookers are a favorite at WIRED. The brand uses \u201cfuzzy logic technology\u201d with a microcomputer (hence the abbreviation \u201cmicom\u201d in the product name) to make tiny adjustments in heat placement, ensuring that your grains are perfectly done, with minimal effort and no burned or wet spots. We have seen this one dip slightly lower, but this is still a good deal.\nWe love Le Creuset's enameled cast iron dishes (the bread pan isn't on sale, but it's one of our favorites). This roasting pan is a good size for everything from chicken to a prime rib.\nPhotograph: Bee's Wrap\nPlastic wrap is annoying. Try these beeswax wraps instead. They're organic cotton and sustainably sourced beeswax (along with jojoba oil and tree resin), which makes them waterproof (just make sure to use cold water to rinse them; hot water could melt off the wax). See our Best Reuseable Products guide for more great options.\nThese are a WIRED favorite. They do everything a single-use Ziplock bag does but, of course, they don't need to be thrown out and are dishwasher-, freezer-, and microwave-safe. You can also use them to keep supplies like screws, crayons, and bobby pins organized.\nIn addition to Stasher, we also love Rezip reusable baggies. They're durable, freezer-safe, and easy to clean\u2014just stick them in the dishwasher. They're also much cheaper than Stasher if you want to dip your toes into reusables. This is the 5-piece set, but there are a bunch of other options discounted too.\nPhotograph: HydroJug\nThe HydroJug (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite water bottles. It's big and heavy, but it can be a useful tool if you're often unmotivated to fill smaller, scrawnier bottles. The sale price extends to a variety of colors.\nOn Prime Day a few years ago, I (Louryn) got a multipack of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, and I accidentally conditioned myself to crave them before bed. If you fall into the same trap, or you're a normal person and you just enjoy a spicy snack from time to time, this is a good and cheap way to restock. Use Subscribe and Save to get the lowest price (or pay the nominal difference of $2 more for a one-time shipment). You can always cancel Subscribe and Save shipments after your first order arrives.\nThis All-Clad set includes 10-inch and 12-inch frying pans, which is a nice combo for families or anyone who regularly needs larger pans. All-Clad's D3 stainless steel construction has a very even heat distribution and is pretty durable. Reviewer Scott Gilbertson has seen these warp after about 10 years, but so far it hasn't happened to his. You can find more All-Clad deals here.\nWe haven't been able to try 1Zpresso's hand grinder yet, but it gets high marks from espresso gurus around the web. It's over triple the price of our favorite hand grinder, the Hario Skerton Pro ($50), so there are certainly cheaper ways to grind, but the J-Max has always garnered high marks for its ability to deliver a very even fine grind.\nPhotograph: Ninja\nThe compact pick in our guide to the best air fryers, Ninja's Max XL is notable for its space-saving design, which leaves countertop space for other tasks such as prepping vegetables. The max crisp setting is perfect for making homemade fries with a nice amount of crunch, and you can even modify conventional oven recipes to work with the Ninja.\nThe trick-or-treaters are coming (or perhaps just the midnight munchies). In any case, Amazon has a bunch of candy on sale right now, with prices starting at $2. Who doesn't need a 24-pack of Nerd Ropes?\nThese are reviewer Louryn Strampe's favorite coffee mugs, and not just because they're a brilliant shade of pink. The cups' construction makes it appear like your drink is floating, and the 16-ounce capacity means more coffee down your gullet.\nPhotograph: Zwilling\nIf you have kids who touch everything dangerous in your kitchen, we recommend the double-walled Zwilling kettle in our Best Kettles guide. It comes with six presets, as well as a dedicated button for making baby formula.\nOnce our top pick for chef knives, the Victorinox is still a great knife. We really like the nearly nonstick finish\u2014hardly anything sticks to this blade, not even fresh cilantro. It's a great all-around kitchen knife and well worth grabbing at this price.\nBest Prime Day Coffee Deals\nBreville Barista Express Impress Espresso Machine Photograph: Breville\nWhat we love about the Breville Impress (6\/10, WIRED Review) is that beginners can make good to very good espresso right out of the box. Breville has done a nice job of automating some of the trickier elements of espresso-making. The downside is that we found a good bit of variation from shot to shot.\nThe Barista Touch is a coffee shop in a machine. You get a built-in burr grinder, a hot water spout, and a digital display to control your brews. Tap the Latte button and the Touch will crank out a latte, even foaming the milk. The results are not as good as what you can do by hand, but it's a nice option if you're feeling lazy.\nThere are dozens of these milk frothers available on Amazon, from dozens of different spammy companies all selling more or less the same device. None of them are outstanding, but I bought one a few years ago and, surprisingly, it's still going. Use it to froth milk, or for what I do: mixing up matcha tea. Will this one last you years? I honestly don't know, but at least you're only out $8 if it doesn't.\nPhotograph: Fellow\nNothing beats the speed and convenience of an electric kettle for heating up water to a precise temperature. Stovetop kettles can't compete on any criteria. Plus, if you want to get into pour-over coffee, which many WIRED staffers heartily recommend, your kettle will need a gooseneck so that your pour is precise. The nearly identical EKG+ (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) has a smooth pour and can hold its temperature for up to an hour before it auto shuts off, although the 2.5-foot cable could stand to be longer.\nWe go nuts for coffee here on WIRED's Gear Team, and the ingenious AeroPress is one of our favorite portable coffee makers. It makes a damn fine cup of brew. It also happens to be incredibly easy to use and clean up. This one will make 10 fluid ounces of coffee up to a time, which is about a diner mug's worth.\nBest Prime Day Mattress Deals\nHelix Midnight Luxe Hybrid Mattress Photograph: Helix\nEnter code DEALDAY25 at checkout to get this deal, which includes two pillows. This matches the best price we've seen our favorite mattress reach. The Midnight Luxe has six layers of foam and individually wrapped inner springs. It's medium-firm and comfortable for almost all sleeping positions. There are other firmness levels within the Luxe collection that we haven't tested yet.\nCasper's hybrid bed reaches its $1,495 price but is often $1,196 on Amazon. Still, this price is among the best deals we've tracked on a bed from the brand that put bed-in-a-box mattresses on the map. This hybrid is a great neutral option. Did you read our guide and have no idea which one to go with? Get this one. It strikes a good balance between soft and supportive, with just enough bounce.\nPhotograph: My Green Mattress\nEnter code DISCOVER at checkout to see this discount. We have seen this dip slightly lower in the past, but the base price has risen since then and this price is lower than recent sales. This is our top organic mattress pick for kids. It's made from certified organic cotton, wool, and latex.\nEnter code DISCOVER at checkout to apply this discount. If you aren't ready for a whole new mattress, spruce up your existing one with a mattress topper. This organic latex choice from My Green Mattress is our favorite firm topper\u2014it's 2 inches high, has a zipper if you need to remove the organic cotton cover from the pad, and stays in place nicely without needing any straps.\nBrooklinen Weighted Throw Blanket Photograph: Brooklinen\nThis price is for the terra-cotta color only. Brooklinen's weighted blanket is 12 pounds but feels sufficiently weighty. It's held up well through many trips in the wash and cat biscuit-making sessions. It's also prettier than some other options with one side having a nice texture pattern.\nWe like several Brooklinen sheets, and this is our favorite organic set. They're soft, but not overly silky and you shouldn't sleep too hot in them. They are made from Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified organic cotton and are Oeko-Tex certified, which means they're tested for and do not contain any known toxic chemicals.\nThis amazing and gigantic blanket will be the focus of its own story in a few weeks' time. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe loves it. True to its name, it's massive, measuring 10 feet by 10 feet, so it's really easy to share\u2014even if you're a blanket hog like she is. The price matches what we've seen during other shopping holidays.\nBest Prime Day Smart Home Deals\nPhotograph: Govee\nIn our Govee Buying Guide, we selected this as the best lamp. It has a modern design and support for Amazon Alexa as well as Google Assistant. You can select the lighting using your phone or the included remote. This price matches the lowest we have seen.\nTurn anything plugged into an outlet into a smart device with a smart plug. Our favorite mini smart plug from Kasa is on sale\u2014usually available for around $17, snagging these great plugs for $6 each is a steal. It's easy to control and create routines, and these bulbs work with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings.\nPhilips Hue White and Color Ambiance Starter Kit Photograph: Amazon\nPhilips Hue's smart bulb starter kit isn't a cheap investment, and we usually only recommend it if you're looking for an upgraded kit. But it is a little cheaper right now to get three bulbs, a smart switch, and Philips' smart home hub, which you can use with older Philips bulbs and other third-party accessories. It's the lowest deal we've seen on this kit in months.\nThe Netgear Nighthawk series of routers are well regarded and make up some of the picks in our Best Routers guide. This model isn't one of the fancy ones, but it's a solid choice. You get Wi-Fi 6 support, coverage of up to 3,500 square feet, and the USB input means you can connect a storage drive for shared disk space.\nPhotograph: Newegg\nSitting at the top of our Best Wi-Fi Routers guide, this Wi-Fi 6 router is ideal for the average home seeking more reliable Wi-Fi on a budget. It has a slick, black finish with four antennas, performs reliably, and has four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. It is frequently discounted but hasn't been this low since Amazon's last Prime Day event.\nIf you're battling Wi-Fi dead zones in your house, you may need to add a mesh router to your setup. Our upgrade pick, Eero's Pro 6E (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) makes this process as simple and hands-off as it can be, and each should one covers 2,000 square feet. The brand's subscription is pricey at $10 a month (the cheaper option was eliminated)\u2014you don't have to subscribe for it to work but there are nice features like parental controls. This older Eero router is on sale for $45 if you just need something cheap right now.\nSimpliSafe (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) makes home security easy to set up and expand on as needed with multiple motion, door, and window sensors, plus panic buttons and key fob controllers. The brand has frequent sales\u2014and you've probably heard podcast ads with discount codes\u2014but we don't typically see it reach 50 percent off. We didn't like the indoor SimpliCam, but it has since been updated and we have yet to test the new one. Several other smaller bundles are also discounted between 40 and 50 percent off with different variations of accessories.\nPhotograph: Govee\nGovee makes some of our favorite smart lighting, and this is our pick for a diffused light strip that can be installed on the wall, stairs, or anywhere else in plain view. It comes with adhesive brackets, so you can make curved shapes like clouds. It supports countless effects in the Govee app and works with voice commands from Google Assistant or Alexa. Read our Best Govee Lights guide for more.\nMonster's digital frame isn't as good as options from Aura or Nixplay, which top our guide to the best digital frames, but we like it better than most other cheap frames. The 1280p screen gets you crisp photos and you can use Google Assistant or Alexa with it too. If you just can't imagine spending $150 or so on those other frames, this one works.\nIf you can spend more than the Monster above, we do prefer our top choices, but Skylight's 15-inch frame looks nice whether you put it on a shelf or wall mount it. There's a smaller 10-inch one if you want to spend less.\nEcoFlow River 2 Pro Portable Power Station Photograph: EcoFlow\nIt's debatable whether some of the Best Portable Power Stations are truly all that portable, but this one from EcoFlow is easy to carry, with a large handle along the back. The LiFeP04 battery inside is good for 768 watt-hours and perfect for keeping your gadgets charged up on camping trips. The main downside is fan noise.\nThe smaller version of this recently earned a spot in our Best Portable Chargers guide, and the larger model is our top pick of the Best Portable Power Stations, so the 1000 Plus is definitely worth a look. It packs a 1264Wh-capacity battery, loads of ports, three AC outlets, and is rated at 2,000 watts with a 4,000-watt peak power capability, which means you can plug in electric grills and other small appliances without worrying.\nTile Sticker Two-Pack Photograph: Tile\nIf you're constantly losing remotes, Tile's Stickers can come in handy. These Bluetooth tracker stickers can be stuck onto remotes, e-readers, or anything else you want to keep track of within a 150-foot range. This is the best price we've seen since last year.\nPetcube makes some of our favorite pet cameras, and this one holds more treats (1.5 pounds) and larger pieces (up to 1 inch in diameter) than some of the others we tried. The Bites 2 looks good and has an extensive four-microphone array that sounds great both ways. The Bites 2 Lite loses the laser and is made from plastic rather than aluminum, but it's significantly cheaper, typically at about $100. Right now it's discounted to $80.\nEven with the subscription ($3 per month or $30 per year), this video doorbell is one of the cheapest options around, and it made the honorable mentions section in our Best Video Doorbells guide. Video quality is 1080p with a limited field of view, and notifications aren't the fastest, but it performs reliably. If you don't want a subscription, consider buying it bundled with Sync Module 2 ($47), which is also half-price right now.\nNiu KQi3 Pro Photograph: Niu\nThis is our favorite electric scooter for most people. It goes on sale regularly, so never pay full price for one. The KQi3 has great range, going 18 to 20 miles for most people. It maxes out at 20 miles per hour, the 9.5-inch tubeless tires offer a comfy ride, and the disc brakes reliably bring it to a quick stop.\nEven after trying the newer Withings Body Comp smart scale, the Body+ model is still in the sweet spot for us. It tracks data about your health including body fat, muscle mass, and total body water, and can display charts of your progress over time.\nThis is an upgraded model of our favorite, the Body+ mentioned above. It adds extra features to keep an eye on your heart health, like its built-in heart monitor that can analyze your cardiovascular health using vascular age data. We found this wasn't totally worth the extra price on the more expensive Withings Body Comp scale, but the Body Cardio is cheaper normally, and even better on this sale.\nWater damage is one of the most frightening and potentially expensive disasters any homeowner can face, but if you learn about a leak swiftly enough you can keep damage to a minimum. This kit comes with four sensors and a hub and uses the relatively long-range LoRa standard to alert you the minute any of the sensors detects water. It is our pick for larger properties in our Best Water Leak Detectors guide.\nPhotograph: Aqara\nThis chunky doorbell offers 1080p video and a wide 162-degree field of view to help you monitor your front porch. It takes regular AA batteries (but can also be wired) and it comes with an indoor hub that can record video locally onto a microSD card, but also doubles as a Wi-Fi repeater and a chime. It has wide smart home compatibility, and can even be used with Apple's HomeKit Secure Video, which is what earned it a place in our Best Video Doorbells guide.\nIf you want to stay powered up on your travels, you need a travel adapter, and this one from Epicka is the budget pick in our Best Travel Adapters guide. It works in more than 150 countries and has four USB-A ports on the bottom, plus a 15-watt USB-C port on the side. It has dropped this low before, but not for a while.\nGet not one, not two, but four of our favorite smart bulbs for the best price we've seen all year. These smart bulbs are easy to use, beautifully vibrant, comes with a variety of present colors, and work with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\nPhotograph: Nanoleaf\nWe love this light kit for adding fun ambient lighting to any room. Each hexagon is its own light, so you can control and customize the hexagons into just about any design of your choosing\u2014both in color schemes. and onto your wall. Just grab a level to make sure you put them on straight!\nThe Google Nest Hub Max has a nice big screen and slim, powerful speakers to match. It's our favorite smart display for a variety of reasons, from how nicely it doubles as a photo frame to how great it is as a kitchen assistant.\nBest Prime Day Home, Apparel, and Personal Care Deals\nTherabody Smart Goggles Photograph: Therabody\nTherabody's Smart Goggles (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) use heat, vibrations, and light pressure to massage your eyes and temples. The app lets you customize sessions and track your heart rate to help reduce stress and anxiety. It feels amazing, but it's very expensive\u2014all Therabody products are\u2014and I noticed a small hole in the eye pad after a while. It hasn't gotten bigger, but it's worth noting. We're testing Gravity's competing eye massager right now. It's not app-controlled, but it's much cheaper and we don't hate it so far.\nThe TheraFace Pro is a very expensive self-care tool. We liked it, finding it exfoliated away blackheads, cleared up stuffy sinuses from allergies, and even minimized fine lines. But there are also buzzwordy functions that may or may not work, like microcurrent. It hasn't gone on sale often in its yearish shelf life so if you can afford to spend this much on a skincare device, it's a good time to grab it. Unfortunately, the hot and cold heads are an additional $99.\nWillow Go Wearable Breast Pump Photograph: Willow\nOur favorite wearable breast pump is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to bring anywhere. What's not easy is the price tag you usually find on the Willow Go (8\/10, WIRED Recommends). It's priced similarly to a standard portable pump right now, though, making it much more worth the splurge.\nIf you're shopping for baby gear, a good deal goes a long way with how much stuff you need before little one arrives. While insurance covers some of the cost of pumps, it's often not all of it. Depending on the insurance you have, this current deal on the Elvie Stride (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) may get you closer to the price that your plan will cover.\nOur favorite stroller is all-around great: it comes with an adapter for infant car seats, has great suspension without being bulky, and folds down surprisingly close to flat. It's already a great deal for its regular price, and even more worth purchasing right now. We occasionally see it go a little lower than $300 on sale, but this is a great price to jump on.\nTushy Classic 3.0 Bidet Photograph: TUSHY\nA person once asked rhetorically: If you fell in the mud, would you reach for a sheet of toilet paper or a hose? They were talking about bidets, and put that way, it does seem to be a cleaner option. Certainly, it's gentler on your caboose. The Tushy is affordable and, as far as bidets go, easy to install on practically any toilet. There's no need for an electrical plug or a hot water hookup, which is why we gave it the recommendation as the best budget bidet that's non-electric.\nTrimming and edging the lines of a beard can be just as time-consuming and aggravating as edging a lawn. Most trimmers on the market make do with too many plastic guides of different lengths\u2014too many\u2014and yet not enough attachments for fine detailing. The Multigroom Series 9000 comes with an adjustable guide from 1 to 3 millimeters, plus a mini-foil shaver, narrow-width head, T-shaped head, ear\/nose attachment, and more. Its stainless steel construction is a rarity among consumer-level trimmers, too, and feels solid in the hand, as if you're a semi-professional barber working magic rather than just a guy in a bathroom mirror.\nCoway Airmega 250 Air Purifier Photograph: Amazon\nFor larger rooms, you want a larger air purifier, and we recommend the Airmega 250 as the best air purifier for living rooms. Product reviewer Matt Jancer has been using one for years to keep the air inside his New York City apartment clean and pure. Filters tend to be expensive at $60 to 80, but he's gotten nearly a year out of each filter, so the performance-per-price is worth it, in his opinion. Its automatic functioning will kick the purifier into high gear if heavy pollution is detected, but normally it runs on a whisper-quiet low setting when needed. Even sitting a few feet away, Matt doesn't notice it.\nEnter code WOOF25 at checkout to see this discount. I get compliments on this Diggs carrier every time I bring my cats to the vet. It works for cats or smaller dogs and it feels high-end in its construction, with lots of pockets for you. There are safety features like seat belt clips and a buckle strap and it's also been crash-tested and gets a five-star rating by the Center for Pet Safety. The only thing I dislike is that you can't really see through the mesh to make sure your pet is OK, but the company says this is to give nervous pets some privacy and calmness.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nA sunrise alarm wakes you up at you set time by gradually brightening and changing the color temperature, or the color spectrum, to mimic real sunlight. It's a gentler way to wake up than a blaring alarm. Like most sunrise alarms, the WiiM also has a sunset feature for winding down before bed. Of all the ones WIRED reviewer Matt Jancer tested, the WiiM was the easiest to set up and walk the user through its operation on the connected app.\nWIRED reviewer Matt Jancer has relied on the 35-pint model to keep his East Coast apartment habitable during sweltering, humid summers. You can set the desired humidity level in 5 percent increments from 35 to 85, and the automatic functioning will turn the machine on and off as needed. It's not particularly loud for a dehumidifier, and Jancer has to empty the water bin only once per day on his smaller model.\nAn electric fan is an ideal way to save a bit of money on air conditioning costs and to add a bit of pleasant white noise to boot. Unlike air conditioning, they take only a sip of electricity to run. WIRED reviewer Matt Jancer has been using the Vornado 460 for three summers and says its ability to move an impressive amount of air around a bedroom on the lowest setting belies its smallish size.\nPhotograph: Dyson\nThis has been on sale for $300 for a little while, but we still like this price. The Dyson Supersonic (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best hair dryers you can buy. It's also extremely expensive, so definitely buy it while it is on sale rather than paying full price.\nWe recommend this hair tool in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners. We have not seen it drop so low in price before. The flat iron is easy to use and comfortable to hold. We wish it had more temperature settings, but it's best for finer, wavier hair. If you want something simple that'll do the trick, and your hair isn't too textured, this is a solid option.\nThis multi-styling tool is also featured in our Best Hair Straighteners guide. It comes with round and paddle-brush attachments to get whatever look you're trying to achieve. The price is a match of the lowest we have tracked.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nWIRED readers love LifeStraw filters, and this is the lowest we tend to see them drop in price. We include this product in our guide to the Best Home Emergency Gear. It removes 99 percent of waterborne bacteria and pathogens. At this price, you could pick one up for each member of the family.\nThis is very similar to a coat we recommended in our affordable cold-weather gear guide. Orolay coats consistently go viral because they're budget-friendly and warm. While we haven't tested this exact jacket, the reviews are positive and the price is right. Other coats from the brand are also on sale.\nA full review of this bed is coming, but the tl;dr is it's super comfy with a soft, machine-washable cover and it's big enough for adults to relax in. If you stare longingly at your pet as they snooze in their tiny beds, you might want to consider investing in your own. It's expensive though, so the $100 discount is welcome.\nPhotograph: Gravity\nThe Gravity Move (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite massage guns. It's compact but works sore muscles with ease. The Move comes with four attachment heads, including a heated one that feels heavenly. We just wish the case was bigger\u2014it only fits the device and one head at a time.\nNavigating the sheer amount of printer options available is exhausting. We don't have a full printer guide just yet, but after my last one died, I bought this one on the recommendation of a fellow WIRED reviewer and have been more than happy with the results. Prints and scans are good quality. It's also wireless and you can print from your phone too.\nYou've likely seen these candles floating around your feeds and they're great buys to treat yourself or to gift others. They're 13.5 ounces, smell good, and are hand-poured in the US. Also astrology is fun, whether you're actually into it or not\u2014according to the company, I, Nena, having been born on March 28, am reclusive by nature. Accurate!\nPhotograph: Loop\nI (Adrienne) have two pairs of these ear plugs, which are the Best for Sleep in our Best Earplugs guide. They are stylish, have different-sized ear tips, and stay put much more easily than the foam ones that you buy in a giant can. I like that they're reusable!\nThis handy tool has been steadily $25 for the last few months. It isn't a huge discount, but if you have pets, you need this. Roll it across your furniture to trap all the fur in its inner compartment, then just open it up and toss that fur in the trash. It works well and you don't have to worry about refilling sticky lint rollers.\nDog owners tend to know exactly the genetic makeup of their pups. Cat owners, not so much. Basepaws gives you a chance to learn more about your feline friends. We received PDF reports 70ish pages long detailing breed percentages and it states if they're a carrier or at risk of several health issues. Any pet can get sick at any time, but it's nice to know if you're up against something that you can maybe prevent.\nI (Adrienne) am currently running in these shoes, which have a wide toe box and are designed to switch easily between running on trails and roads. They're incredibly versatile.\nLast Prime Day, we were shocked to see that Amazon even carried one of our favorite recycled clothing brands. And lo, here we are, shocked again. This is the price we saw in July for some of the best recycled workout clothes.\nBest Prime Day Vacuum Deals\nDyson V15 Detect Cordless Stick Vacuum Photograph: Dyson\nThe V15 Detect holds the top spot in our Best Dyson Vacuums guide. At 7 pounds, it's lightweight, and Dyson has made it simple to convert into a handheld model. Since it's a Detect model, it also comes with a head that projects a green laser to help you spot microscopic dust\u2014making it easy to catch particles that are invisible to the naked eye.\nLupe's cordless vacuum (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best we tried and while it's cheaper than a Dyson, it's still very expensive even on sale. The cleaner head has a standard rotating brush and a composite foam roller, and when using its highest setting, that foam creates a strong seal against the ground. Most cordless vacs are best used in between really good cleanings with a more powerful upright vacuum, but the Lupe might be all you need. Unfortunately, it sounds terrible.\nThis is the best budget-friendly Dyson, and thanks to today's deal price, the vacuum is even more accessible. It can be converted into a hand vacuum and has a runtime of about 40 minutes. The included attachments will make it easier to get into the various nooks and crannies of your home.\nIn our guide to the Best Dyson Vacuums, we say this model is worthwhile if it's priced between $300 and $400. Well, well, well, would you look at that? Looks like the price is right. This is a solid pick for pet owners. It's similar to the Animal 3, but this model has a self-adjusting cleaner head that automatically raises and lowers the base plate to seal in suction on all floor types. There's also a motorized brush for added efficiency.\nPhotograph: Shark\nThe Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite vac-mop combo in our Best Robot Vacuums guide. It vacuums well and does a thorough job of scrubbing the floors (using the included mopping bin) without getting the carpets wet. It also uses laser navigation to accurately map your home, allowing you to subdivide vacuuming and mopping zones within the easy-to-use app.\nThe Eufy X9 Pro (6\/10, WIRED Review) doesn't work well as a stand-alone robot vacuum, but it's the best mopping vacuum we've tried. On the bottom of the X9 Pro are two mops that both rotate at about 180 revolutions per minute; it's both fast and accurate. WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So says it only took 30 minutes to mop her kitchen (including a spilled half-bottle of syrup without leaving the floor sticky), laundry room, and bathroom. The docking station dries the mops for you too, so they don't get gross.\nPhotograph: Roborock\nRoborock recently launched an upgrade to this model, our favorite robot vacuum and our current top pick. WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So says that, after several years, it's still the one vacuum she hasn't unplugged and consistently calls on to clean her house after other robot vacuums have failed.\nShark's AI Ultra 2-in-1 (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) has an amazing amount of functionality for the price compared to similar robot vac-mops out there, and that's before this sweet sale price. It uses laser navigation to map your home, and you can use an app to divide it into mopping and vacuuming areas depending on your flooring. The mopping is effective without getting your floors wet, too, and you won't need replacement bin bags. The price is specifically for the black and gold colorway, but the black and silver model is also on sale (though not as much as the gold version).\nBissell Little Green Machine Carpet Cleaner Photograph: Bissell\nThis is a match of the lowest price we tend to see for this little green machine. It made our list of the Best Carpet Cleaners and the Best Viral TikTok Gadgets. It's great for cleaning furniture, stairs, and vehicles.\nThis is the version of Samsung's stick vacuum that does not purport to use AI. The good news is that you probably don't really need machine learning in a vacuum, as I noted in my review (7\/10, WIRED Review). This is a great vacuum if your midcentury modern home needs a vacuum to fit in with the stylish decor.\nRefresh your rugs with this smart carpet cleaner, which has a clever design and is fairly easy to maneuver. It is great at sucking grime out of your carpet, has a drying mode, and comes with attachments for upholstery. As the upgrade pick in our Best Carpet Cleaners guide, the relatively high price is our main criticism, so it's worth taking advantage of the discount. It does occasionally drop, but we have never seen it lower than this.\nIt can be a pain having to lug around a heavy carpet cleaner to deal with a spill or pet-related accident, so this portable, cordless cleaner from Bissell is handy. It is also mercifully easy to take apart and clean after you've dealt with the mess. It appears in our Best Carpet Cleaners guide as our favorite spot cleaner.\nBest Prime Day Lego and Other Toy Deals\nLego Marvel Hulkbuster Photograph: Amazon\nThis is not the enormous, 6,000-piece set for adults, but the version for kids. Still, commemorative theme sets tend to increase in value if you don't open them and hold them for a few years (if you can convince yourself to do that). It was $34 less when this sale first started.\nOne of the most gratifying parts of parenthood is realizing that your children are now fascinated by the same toys and characters that you loved when you were little. It never fails to blow my mind that my 6-year-old also knows who Optimus Prime is. This action figure transforms from a truck (very cool) into a robot (even cooler!) to save the Earth from the evil Decepticons. This would make a great holiday present.\nAdrienne's 6-year-old son has this playset, which they unfortunately paid full price for in a moment of weakness. It's incredibly sturdy and has lasted for several years while being stomped on and thrown into battle with other playsets. The Grimlock T-Rex motorcycle is obviously the coolest one, but siblings can share.\nYoto Player Photograph: Yoto\nKids will love this durable, portable speaker, as it can handle bedtime stories, music, and other content by slotting in cards. It also features a kid-friendly radio and a sleep mode. This appears in our Best Kids Speakers guide and is suitable for children from ages 3 to 12.\nIf you have a vase you love, but wish your flowers would last longer, LEGO has the answer for you. Build these artificial flowers that range from roses, poppies, daises and snapdragons to add to your favorite vessel.\nBehold this adorable stack of pancakes complete with a butter-and-syrup flower garnish. Have you ever seen a cuter Squishmallow? I highly doubt it. Tons of Squishmallows are on sale for Prime Day. Other options include a narwhal, hedgehog, mushroom, and possum. You can view them all here.\nMagna-Tiles are addicting for just about any kid, in the best kind of way. They're a STEM toy we're major fans of for a variety of ages. This set lets you build a road and cranes, so it's a great choice for any construction enthusiast or as an add-on to any current Magna-Tiles owners.\nFor a hazy few years, WIRED editor Adrienne So says her kids were obsessed with the Lego Ninjago series. (The show was originally commissioned as a limited run and then extended for its popularity.) This is a pretty reasonable price for a biggish 1,060-piece set that looks like a relatively simple build with a ton of minifigs.\nThis is a 4,049-piece set from the 2015 film Avengers: Age of Ultron, complete with three light-up arc reactors and compatibility with the Iron Man figure (sold separately).\nIf you're looking for a more interactive Lego set, look no further than the City Stuntz Ultimate Stunt Riders Challenge. It comes with a 360-degree loop, a ring of fire, an \u201calien tower\u201d vertical climb, a ramp, two toy motorcycles, and four Lego City minifigures. The three stunt challenges can be configured in a variety of different ways too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this Lego set, so far.\nBest Prime Day TV and Soundbar Deals\nSamsung The Frame Photograph: Walmart\nAnyone who cares about the aesthetics of their space probably doesn't want to stare at their TV screen all the time. That's where Samsung's The Frame comes in. This TV looks like a piece of art when not in use, helping it blend into the background of your well-curated space.\nThis quantum dot-enabled OLED is the brightest organic LED display that we've tested. It has shockingly bright colors to go with its great contrast. Small bezels also aid in a super immersive picture, making this one of the best TVs for brighter rooms.\nAmazon's Fire TVs are a solid and affordable way to get a quality screen for very little money. This 65-inch model has Dolby Vision support for good colors, and you can control it using your voice and Alexa.\nPhotograph: Hisense\nThe Hisense U8K is among the best-value TVs we've ever seen. It features a mini-LED display for ultra-bright colors and great contrast and is super easy to set up and use thanks to the onboard Google interface. Learn more in our full review (8\/10, WIRED Recommends).\nHisense is a purveyor of quality mid-tier TVs, and this U7 is no exception. If you're after a larger screen to enjoy sports, the 144-Hz native refresh rate makes games (both real and virtual) look smooth as silk. I also like that it supports the latest high dynamic range codecs, so you'll get the brightest, most vibrant colors possible.\nIf you need a super large screen and you don't have a ton of cash lying around, this option from TCL is solid. It has support for the latest high dynamic range codecs like Dolby Vision for great colors, and the built-in Fire TV interface features essentially any app you want. It's not the brightest or prettiest TV ever, but it is big and has bold color.\nNanoleaf's 4D Kit (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) can turn any movie or video game into a beautiful, immersive experience. The kit comes with both a trimmable light strip that fits TVs as large as 65 inches, and Nanoleaf's 4D camera that captures the TV screen's colors and projects them onto the wall behind the TV. The larger size is on sale, too, if your TV is between 65 and 85 inches.\nPhotograph: JBL\nThe JBL Bar 1300X (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with detachable wireless speakers. You can pop off the two speakers on the side of the main soundbar and place them wherever you'd like without having to worry about whether there are power outlets nearby or having to hide cables. It also has some of the best Dolby Atmos immersion we've heard from a soundbar at this price. The only downside is that, without cables, you'll have to charge the speakers between uses.\nYamaha's SR-C20A is our favorite affordable soundbar. It's affordable to tack onto even a very modest TV budget and its 100-watt forward-facing drivers can easily outperform the speakers on most TVs.\nWe're fans of nearly everything Roku offers and that includes this Streambar, which allows you to upgrade your sound and your streaming with one device. It's small enough that it's ideal for homes where space is at a premium, but still sounds good.\nPhotograph: TCL\nThis is our favorite TV to recommend for most people. The mid-tier model (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) comes equipped with quantum dot technology and support for every high dynamic range (HDR) format for stunning colors. There's a game mode too, which uses software that can upscale 1080p to 120 frames per second. It's worth noting that, unlike older models, this one comes with Google TV instead of Roku. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\nWIRED reviewer Jaina Grey has spent a few years with this very large dual-subwoofer soundbar system from Japan. The two huge subwoofers deliver earth-shattering bass, while the two side speakers and rear speakers provide more lifelike reproduction than soundbars that bounce sound off the walls for side and rear noises. It also comes with support for all major object-based surround formats (like DTS:X and Dolby Atmos). It's great for large spaces, where the extra bass response helps things feel more cinematic. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\nFor the luxury-minded, this extravagant soundbar from Sennheiser is our top pick. It has massive speakers with some of the best audio quality we've seen (or heard, I suppose) of any soundbar we've tested. It's also one of the most expensive we recommend, but its price very rarely dips this low, so if you've been waiting for the perfect sale to grab one, now's the time.\nIf you're the type to set up smart speakers and gadgets throughout your home, this soundbar from Yamaha lets you cut down on some of that work. It comes with Amazon Alexa built in, and can control a host of other smart home gadgets. We've actually seen this soundbar's price fluctuate a fair amount recently, sometimes as low as $180, but this is still nearly the cheapest we've ever seen it, so it's a good time to grab one.\nBest Prime Day Camera Deals\nGoPro Hero10 Photograph: GoPro\nGoPro recently dropped the price of the Hero10 Black (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) to $249, which makes it one of the cheapest action cameras on the market. It's two generations old, but still a very capable camera. This deal nets you an extra battery, case, small tripod, and other accessories. Check out our Best Action Cameras guide for more buying advice.\nAn upgrade over our Canon top pick in our mirrorless camera guide, the R5 features a 45-megapixel full-frame CMOS Sensor, staggeringly fast autofocus, excellent subject tracking in continuous AF mode, and dual memory card slots. It isn't cheap, but this is a pro-level beast of a camera. Note that the deal is on the body only; the lenses are sold separately.\nWe've seen this deal a couple of times in the past month, but it's still a good one. Sony's A7 III has been superseded by the A7 IV, but it's still a very nice camera. The 24.2-megapixel sensor has fantastic dynamic range and the decently fast phase-detection autofocus means you won't miss those key shots.\nPhotograph: Lexar\nI swear by these cards. I have been using them for seven years now without issue (back then they were much more expensive). They're fast enough for every camera that I've ever tested for WIRED, and I've never had any issue with them after years of life being tossed around in various camera bags.\nI remain puzzled as to why CFexpress cards are so dang expensive, but they are and if your camera uses them (and most modern, high-end video cameras do) this is about as good of a deal as we've ever seen.\nSanDisk 2-TB Extreme Portable SSD Photograph: Amazon\nOur favorite speedy portable SSD, the SanDisk is lightweight, with IP22-rated enclosures so it'll stand up to life on the go. I have been using this drive to make weekly backups for almost two years now and have had no issues. That said, our friends at Ars Technica, and other users around the web, have noted extremely high failure rates with this drive, mainly with the 2- and 4-TB versions. SanDisk has issued a firmware update, which seems to fix the problem.\nSamsung's T7 external solid-state drives are among the WIRED gear team's favorites. Lightning fast and reliable, solid-state drives take less babying than hard drives. The T7 Shield comes with a rubberized exterior to protect it from drops and impacts, and it's also IP65 water- and dust-resistant. It comes with a USB-C cable, fits in the palm of your hand, and doesn't require an external power source. Product reviewer Matt Jancer has been using several T7s and T7 Shields for three years and has never had even a hiccup. Other capacities are also on sale.\nCanon SELPHY QX10 Portable Square Photo Printer Photograph: Amazon\nSeveral WIRED staffers love this little printer that outputs perfectly-sized, small-but-not too-small, Polaroid-like images. Though technically it costs $150, this printer has been hovering at $129 lately, but $78 is still a solid deal. This price is for the black but the other colors are discounted to $99. The larger Canon SELPHY CP1500 printer we tried is also on sale for $99. That's also a solid price, but not uncommon.\nTravel and Outdoor Deals\nPhotograph: Amazon\nI (Matt Jancer) have wheeled, lifted, and slung around a lot of budget bags over dozens of trips across the globe, and the Maxlite is the one I recommend as the best budget suitcase. It's lightweight at 5.4 pounds, reasonably well made compared to the competition, and stands up to the cargo bellies of aircraft without anything more than scuff marks. For a carry-on, the two-wheel rollaboard is my preference, since it offers more interior space than a four-wheel spinner.\nHydro Flask routinely make some of our favorite insulated water bottles. Most insulated travel mugs these days can keep ice water cold and hot coffee warm. What makes Hydro Flask stand out is the durability of their powder coating. I've (Matt Jancer) knocked several around for years in gyms, at the base of rock climbing walls outdoors, and rolling around the floorboards of my old car and have never managed to scratch or dent one yet.\nThis electric bike has good looks, strong acceleration, and a better price point than the competition, especially right now with the major sale Wing is having. It's got a built-in headlight and taillight, comfortable hand grips, and a nicer seat than you'd expect. It checks a lot of boxes at its higher price point, so this is a great time to jump on this deal.\nWhen Is Amazon Prime Big Deal Days?\nAmazon's second big sale event runs from Tuesday, October 10 through Wednesday, October 11, 2023. It ends at 2:59 am ET on October 11 (11:59 pm PT).\nWill You Need a Prime Membership?\nYes, this event is for Amazon Prime members, meaning most of these Prime Day deals are for subscribers only. If you want to take the ride you need to buy the ticket. In this case, the ticket is $15 a month, and you get free two-day shipping. There are a whole bunch of other Prime Day perks you can take advantage of as well. You can also sign up for a 30-day Amazon Prime trial. Just register before the event and cancel right when the trial ends so you can take advantage of these deals. That said, there are a lot of discounted products available to folks who are not Prime subscribers. Retailers like Best Buy and Walmart are also price-matching some items or throwing their own competing sales.\nWhat Are Invite-Only Deals?\nDuring Prime Day this past summer, Amazon introduced invite-only deals\u2014a system to help make it easier for Prime members to access deals that are expected to sell out quickly\u2014and the company brought it back for Prime Big Deal Days. The feature is only available on select products but it has spread across a variety of categories and price points.\nIf a specific product is part of the Invite-Only Deals system, you'll see a \u201cRequest Invite\u201d button on the right-hand side. All you have to do is click it for a chance to buy the product at that sale price. However, it's important to note that there's no guarantee you'll receive the invite. You can learn more about the program and how it works in our story on How to Shop Like a Pro During Amazon Prime Day.\nWhen is Prime Day (Prime Big Deal Days)?\nThe second and presumably final Amazon Prime Day 2023 is happening right about.... now. Prime Day deals started flowing at 3 am EST on October 10 and will continue through October 11.\nHow to find the best Prime Big Deal Days deals?\nWIRED is the only publication posting about Amazon Prime Day. Wait, sorry, looks a handful of other sites are, too. But you should only read WIRED, because we actually vet every deal and compare it to the actual street price instead of an absurd MSRP that you will never observe in the wild. Also, we review the products we recommend and don't just send you Prime Day deals on junk that will break. It's only a deal if you need it and it's good!\nAre other retailers running sales?\nAmazon Prime Day has inspired many imitators and you'll find sales from competitors like Best Buy, Target, and the like. Some of these sales are great, and we'll flag when they are, but others are worth holding off on until Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when WIRED will again be the Internet's only website with deals posts.\nRetailer Sale Pages\n\nThis article, authored by Scott Gilbertson, was published by Wired on 2023-10-10 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":520}
{"title":"Here are the best Kindle deals right now","context":"## Here are the best Kindle deals right now\n\nWhen it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.\nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon looks to be moving beyond books and into the realm of writing \u2014 something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.\nBelow, we\u2019ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes, there isn\u2019t a deal for one or any of the products, but we\u2019ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. Keep in mind that Amazon also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.\nImage: Amazon\nThe best Kindle (2022) deals\nWhat does it mean when a Kindle is \u201cad-supported\u201d? Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.\nIn case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle last year, one that\u2019s designed to replace the 2019 model. The latest Kindle \u2014 which starts at $99.99 \u2014 puts Amazon\u2019s base e-reader more in line with the most recent Kindle Paperwhite, providing a number of quality-of-life improvements in the process. The new model features longer battery life, a 300ppi screen, and now charges via USB-C instead of Micro USB. It also touts 16GB of storage by default and comes in a new \u201cdenim\u201d color, which resembles the soft blue you might associate with jeans.\nWe recently saw Amazon\u2019s newest ad-supported Kindle drop to $79.99 ($20 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited included. Right now, though, you can only buy the Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price. However, you can pick it up on sale at Amazon with ads, a power adapter, and a fabric cover starting at $134.97 ($15 off). Regardless of whether you choose the standalone model or the bundle, the new Kindle remains a worthwhile option if you\u2019re looking to pick up an e-reader for less than the latest Paperwhite.\nThe best Kindle Kids (2022) deals\nThe new base Kindle wasn\u2019t the only e-reader Amazon introduced in 2022. The new entry-level model has arrived alongside a new Kindle Kids, which is identical to the standard model but comes with a handful of accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the new model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $119.99.\nIn terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their child access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like Percy Jackson and the entire Harry Potter series at no additional cost.\nWe recently saw the Kindle Kids drop to as low as $79.99 for Black Friday. Right now, however, there are no deals available, meaning you can only buy Amazon\u2019s latest Kindle Kids at Amazon and Best Buy for its full retail price of $119.99.\nVerge Deals on X (formerly Twitter) \/ Join nearly 51,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals Follow us!\nThe Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is identical to the standard model but features wireless charging and a sensor to automatically adjust the backlight. Photo by Chaim Gartenberg \/ The\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2021) deals\nAmazon\u2019s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its 11th-gen model, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger 6.8-inch display. The e-reader launched more than two years ago, and it often receives steep discounts at retailers like Amazon and Best Buy, particularly around Black Friday and throughout the holiday season. You can still occasionally pick up the last-gen model from 2018 at a discount.\nAmazon has also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $169.99, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.\nLastly, if you\u2019re looking for the Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition, Amazon and Best Buy are both selling the kid-friendly ebook reader for $144.99 ($25 off), which is a relatively minor discount but likely the only one we\u2019ll see before the holiday.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nThe best Kindle Oasis (2019) deals\nThe Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $249.99. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.\nThe 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof 7-inch 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.\nIn the past, we\u2019ve seen the 8GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $174.99, which remains the lowest price to date for the standalone configuration. Sadly, however, the ad-supported Oasis is only retailing at Amazon right now starting at $249.99.\nKindle Oasis Essentials Bundle (2019) $ 280 $ 310 10 % off $ 280 $ 280 $ 310 10 % off Amazon\u2019s latest Essentials Bundle packages the most recent Kindle Oasis with a power adapter and your choice of either a fabric or leather cover. $280 at Amazon (8GB)\nAs for bundles, the 8GB Kindle Oasis is currently on sale in its ad-supported configuration at Amazon with a power adapter and either a fabric cover for $279.97 ($30 off) or a leather cover for $289.97 ($30 off).\nImage: Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nThe best Kindle Scribe deals\nThe ad-free Kindle Scribe is Amazon\u2019s biggest e-reader to date \u2014 one that also represents a departure from past Kindle models. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300 dpi, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles have become known. What separates the Scribe from other models, however, is that it comes with one of two styli, which can be used to annotate books, doodle, or jot down notes. We found the e-reader\u2019s note-taking capabilities lacking in our testing, but Amazon has already started to improve the software via free OTA software updates, helping bring it up to speed with other E Ink competitors.\nAs for the model with the Premium Pen, which offers a shortcut button and a built-in eraser, it\u2019s on sale in the 16GB configuration at Amazon starting at $294.99 ($75 off). You can also pick up the 16GB model with a Premium Pen, a folio cover, and a power adapter starting at $334.97 ($115 off).\nKindle Scribe Essentials Bundle $ 310 $ 420 26 % off $ 310 $ 310 $ 420 26 % off Amazon\u2019s base Essentials Bundle comes with a 16GB Kindle Scribe, a Basic Pen stylus, a power adapter, and one of three fabric folio covers. $310 at Amazon\n\nThis article, authored by Sheena Vasani, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-16 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":521}
{"title":"Golden State's draft misses are starting to add up","context":"## Golden State's draft misses are starting to add up\n\nIn June of 2021, Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody sat on a stage on the Chase Center court, with then-GM Bob Myers to their left, as the Warriors introduced their newest first-round draft picks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI talk about the character first because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make that A-grade stick or not. It\u2019s gonna be on what they do from here on out, not what they've done so far.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that the Warriors received glowing grades from draft analysts following their selections of Kuminga, out of the G-League Ignite program, at No. 7, and Arkansas\u2019 Moody at No. 14. Unfortunately for them, that A-grade has not stuck.\nFast-forward more than two years and both players are struggling to make the sort of impact the Warriors had hoped when they flaunted their two-timeline plan. Kuminga, though he\u2019s had flashes and is only 21, is almost as raw as he was as an 18-year-old. He plays nearly 20 minutes per game for a thin Warriors team, but his shooting percentages (43.8% overall, 19.4% on 3s) have dipped to career lows. Moody has been the more stable of the two. He\u2019s a reliable catch-and-shoot threat (38.2% shooting from 3) and earnest defender but doesn\u2019t do much outside the limits of his job description.\nThe Warriors are 8-10 following Tuesday\u2019s disastrous collapse to the Kings in Sacramento. Leading by five with 58 seconds to go and a spot in the next round of the In-Season Tournament on the line, Andrew Wiggins fouled De\u2019Aaron Fox, Stephen Curry passed the ball straight to Malik Monk on his own side of the court, Draymond Green threw the ball out of bounds and Monk scored five points in the final 37 seconds to send the Warriors back to San Francisco forced to ask some tough questions.\nOn the floor for these minutes were Curry, Klay Thompson, Green, Wiggins and Kevon Looney. Four of the five were drafted by the Warriors. Steph, Klay and Draymond are the bedrock of four championship teams and perhaps the NBA\u2019s greatest dynasty this century.\nBut a franchise built through the draft has had very little success selecting players over the past decade.\nIf the Warriors seem old, it\u2019s because they are. Curry (35) can still play at an MVP level, but Green (33) and Thompson (33) are not the players they were during Golden State\u2019s run to five straight Finals.\nGreen (when he isn\u2019t suspended) can still uncork vintage defensive performances, but his offensive game has not aged well as the league trends toward more shooting. The typically affable Thompson, having suffered two major leg injuries since 2019, is bristling at questions about the starting lineup. The Warriors\u2019 starting five \u2013 a dominant unit over the last decade \u2013 is being outscored by an alarming 10.6 points every 100 possessions this season.\nThe Warriors have had a hard time reinventing themselves. The two-timeline approach was supposed to infuse the team with youth and athleticism. Instead, Kuminga and Moody can\u2019t crack the rotation some nights, and 2020\u2019s No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman now plays in Detroit.\nIf anything, the Warriors got older. Over the last nine months, they traded 24-year-old Jordan Poole to the Wizards in a deal that netted 38-year-old Chris Paul, unloaded Wiseman to bring back 30-year-old Gary Payton II and signed 29-year-old Dario Saric to help anchor the second unit. Behind the Bucks and Clippers, the Warriors are the league\u2019s third-oldest team.\nIt\u2019s easy to point to the 2020 and 2021 drafts as the problem. The Warriors \u2013 during a two-year, injury-riddled drought that separated Finals runs \u2013 in 2021 selected Kuminga one pick ahead of Franz Wagner and Moody over Alperen Sengun and Trey Murphy III. The year before, they drafted Wiseman over LaMelo Ball and Tyrese Haliburton.\n(At the risk of saying I told you so, a certain Warriors beat reporter at the time argued for the better picks here and here. There was something to be said of drafting the more NBA-ready players, even at the risk of missing out on Wiseman\u2019s and Kuminga\u2019s ceilings.)\nBut Golden State\u2019s original sins run deeper than that. Here\u2019s a look at their recent draft history.\nLooney, picked in 2015 (when \u201cUptown Funk\u201d and \u201cTrap Queen\u201d were topping music charts) is the only indisputable success. Beyond that, Poole is the only other draft pick to have signed another contract with the Warriors beyond his rookie deal.\nPoole, at 28, helped power the Warriors to the 2022 championship but was in equal amounts part of the problem the next season. (And based on his season in Washington, his 2022 playoff run is looking more and more like an outlier.)\nFour draft picks are now on other teams: Patrick Baldwin, Wiseman, Poole and Damian Jones; and four are no longer in the league: Nico Mannion, Justinian Jessup, Eric Paschall, Jacob Evans.\nJune\u2019s 19th overall pick Brandin Podziemski seems like a base hit right now, but it\u2019s been a month. Do I need to remind you of the brief flashes we saw from Paschall?\nTo be fair, it\u2019s hard to nail the draft when you\u2019re always selecting at 28 and 30. But using three lottery picks and coming away with maybe one fringe rotation player would doom any franchise that doesn\u2019t have Steph Curry.\nFor years, these picks and players have been a luxury for the Warriors, but the age problem is coming to a head. Thompson will be a free agent in seven months, Paul\u2019s contract for next season is not guaranteed and Green\u2019s new contract, though a bargain now, might not look as great when he\u2019s 37 years old.\nMaximizing what\u2019s left of Curry\u2019s championship window will prompt some tough decisions. The Warriors might have to cut bait on the two remaining lottery picks who shared a stage two years ago, Kuminga and Moody. Either one could have value as a \u201csecond draft\u201d candidate for a younger team. For instance, Kuminga\u2019s $6 million salary can be added to Payton to build $14.7 million in outgoing salary. Moody\u2019s $3.9 million is some sugar to sweeten a deal for any of Golden State\u2019s higher-priced players.\nAvailable big names like Zach LaVine might not make a ton of sense given his age and contract, but everything from All-Star acquisitions to trading for helpful role players should be on the table. If the Warriors decide to reorient the roster around Curry between now and February\u2019s trade deadline, new GM Mike Dunleavy Jr. would be tasked with rebuilding a jet mid-flight.\nWhether it\u2019s before the trade deadline or next summer, it feels like something is bound to change in Golden State. The draft picks haven\u2019t panned out and Curry\u2019s supporting cast is showing its age, but finding solutions in the middle is easier said than done.\n\nThis article, authored by Wes Goldberg, RealGM, was published by Yardbarker on 2023-11-29 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":522}

Nine years ago, Michelle Andrews and Zara McDonald were both 20 and working entry-level jobs in Melbourne at women\u2019s media company Mamamia. Covering late shifts, often on weekends, they\u2019d regularly share an Uber home. A friendship soon grew out of their shared love of pop culture. \u201cWe\u2019d be watching the same TV shows and listening to the same podcasts,\u201d says Andrews, now 29. Their back-seat chats eventually led to an idea: Shameless \u2013 \u201ca pop culture podcast for smart people who love dumb stuff\u201d. The story of how they came to leave Mamamia \u2013 after having their idea rejected at the final hour \u2013 has been told many times. But these days, it\u2019s not a moment they think of often, unless they\u2019re asked about it in an interview. \u201cIt ended up being amazing for us that they didn\u2019t want the show,\u201d says Andrews. Fast-forward to today, and the women are now well known as the \u201cShameless girls\u201d \u2013 co-founders of Shameless Media, a company built out of their passion for smart conversations about pop culture. \u201cWe feel so far removed from that time,\u201d adds McDonald, 29, reflecting on their start. Since launching Shameless Media \u2013 the home of not just Shameless but also the Everybody Has a Secret, Shameless Book Club and Love etc. podcasts \u2013 in 2019, the company has gone from strength to strength. Today, it has 1.1 million followers across social media, plus 1 million unique listeners and 2\u00bd million podcast downloads a month.

Both wear Converse shoes, $130, from Hype DC. Credit: Hugh Stewart For the first 10 months, Shameless was a weekend project, the podcast researched and recorded around the pair\u2019s other jobs. In those early days, McDonald and Andrews were self-funded, buying their own podcasting equipment and spending just $70 to print advertising flyers. Even now, McDonald and Andrews have never taken on any outside investment. Profitable from day one, Shameless Media now has 11 staff.\nAdvertisement\nOn the Sunday Life photo shoot in Sydney, the two friends\u2019 support for each other is as obvious as it is genuine. Together, they discuss outfit choices and every comment from either woman about not being able to make a particular item of clothing work is enthusiastically refuted by the other. The respect they have for each other is clear, and it\u2019s why they work so well together. Since launching Shameless, their lives have been entwined. Since meeting, they have been through break-ups, engagements and now weddings. When Andrews tied the knot with her long-term partner Mitchell Rees last December, McDonald was a bridesmaid. Now, McDonald is planning her own wedding, to partner Oliver Keogh, which will take place next year. Years ago, when discussing when, or even if, they each wanted to have kids, it was a conversation they knew they needed to have not just as friends but as business partners. \u201cHow do we do this and have a family if the whole business is relying on us showing up together at the same time?\u201d Zara McDonald \u201cI hate that we had to do this, but it was like, how do we have kids?\u201d says McDonald. \u201cHow do we do this and have a family if the whole business is relying on us showing up together at the same time?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe only way to ensure it wouldn\u2019t be an issue was to create a contingency plan. In their case, that plan involved expanding Shameless Media by growing the team and up-skilling junior employees. While neither Andrews nor McDonald sees kids in her near future, they found it reassuring to work towards a solution. Regardless of the topic of conversation, whether it be personal or work-focused, the two try to be completely honest with each other. \u201cWe realised with every honest conversation we had, our relationship was so much better \u2013 it was far more intimate,\u201d says McDonald. The relationship McDonald and Andrews have with Shameless listeners is also based on trust. Their podcast episodes are meticulously well-researched, book recommendations are solid and the advice given via their Ask Shameless newsletter aims to always hit the mark.

Credit: Hugh Stewart In many ways, the relationship between Shameless Media and its audience is much like that between the friends. It began with a shared interest in celebrity gossip and TV shows, before moving into more personal recommendations of books and podcasts, until eventually reaching the stage where life\u2019s most personal questions can be asked and answered. Ask Shameless, which lands in more than 64,000 subscriber inboxes each Friday, answers reader questions about work, dating, friendship and more. The best of these advice columns have been published in a new book, 4am: Answers to the conundrums that keep you up at night. Andrews and McDonald\u2019s second book feels markedly different to their first, The Space Between. Published in 2020, it looked to explore the complications of life in one\u2019s 20s.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe wrote it when we were so young,\u201d reflects Andrews. \u201cWe truly had internalised this belief that for our words to be worthy of attention, they had to mine the deepest, darkest events that have ever happened to us.\u201d This feeling is one Andrews has spoken about before, referring to an essay she wrote for the book which included details of her sexual assault. \u201cI wish I\u2019d just saved that for myself,\u201d she says, adding that while she wouldn\u2019t take back the essay, she would take back some of the details. Zara McDonald wears Luuda shirt, $390, and shorts, $290. Converse shoes, $130, from Hype DC. Credit: Hugh Stewart Says McDonald, \u201cIf I was to psychoanalyse us, I\u2019d say we felt guilty for having that platform that young.\u201d But that imposter syndrome is nowhere to be seen in 4am, in which Andrews and McDonald are happy to take their rightful place as agony aunts to young Australian women. In it, readers trust Andrews, McDonald and other Shameless columnists with their quandaries on everything from infidelity to sibling rivalry. The book comes at a time when many young women have trust issues. TikTok is serving eating-disorder content to those already struggling, influencers and celebrities post undisclosed advertisements, and algorithms work to push everything from egg-freezing to injectables. Everywhere young women look, someone is making money off them. Zara McDonald (left) wears Venroy mini dress, $200. Michelle Andrews (right) wears Venroy shirt, $280, and pants, $280. Credit: Hugh Stewart\nAdvertisement\nOnly five per cent of the letters submitted to the Ask Shameless inbox are published. But after reading hundreds of requests for advice in the past three years, Andrews and McDonald are in touch with the most prevalent issues plaguing women today. One of those, says Andrews, is that \u201ca lot of young women do not receive the basic level of affection, attention or love from their male partners\u201d. While there are questions the pair don\u2019t feel qualified to answer yet \u2013 such as when to have kids \u2013 there\u2019s also a kind of magic in the fact that Shameless listeners have access to McDonald and Andrews while they\u2019re still in the thick of these struggles themselves. Loading Building a brand on trust is both a big achievement and a risk. How worried are they about getting it wrong? Turns out, not very. Andrews and McDonald know what good advice looks like, and how to give it. \u201cI think the best advice is often not a statement \u2013 it\u2019s a question,\u201d says Andrews. \u201cIt\u2019s listening to what someone\u2019s dilemma is, then posing a question that helps them re-frame.\u201d As two women who are constantly being asked for advice, what are the questions they ask themselves? \u201cWhat\u2019s the next thing?\u201d says Andrews, without hesitation. \u201cI\u2019m constantly wondering, what\u2019s the next show that isn\u2019t out there.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article, authored by Gyan Yankovich, was published by The Age on 2023-10-07 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":523}

Apologies to anyone who literally bought a Steam Deck yesterday.\nAt an event held for press prior to the device's launch, Greg Coomer, a product designer at Valve, called the new model \"the definitive version of the Steam Deck.\" He explained that the device contains many things the company wanted to include at the LCD model's launch but wasn't able to, along with some additions based on community feedback.\nAs its name suggests, the most noticeable upgrade to the Steam Deck OLED is the display. The original Steam Deck had a 7-inch 800p LCD running at 60Hz. The new model squeezes a 7.4-inch OLED screen into the same space, significantly shrinking the bezels around the display. The new panel runs at the same resolution, but with a refresh rate of up to 90Hz. It\u2019s also HDR, covering 110 percent of the P3 color space with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits \u2014 the old model maxed out at around 400 nits. Like all OLED screens, it has pure blacks and near-instantaneous response times. As before, anti-glare etched glass is available, but only on the premium model.\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a die-shrunk version of the same custom APU found in the original Steam Deck. The new APU is produced on a 6nm process, rather than the older 7nm process. Manufacturers typically use die-shrinks to either improve performance or efficiency, and Valve has chosen the latter. The max frequency of both the GPU and CPU are identical between the LCD and OLED models, so for developers tuning their games for Steam Decks, they only have a single performance target.\nIn concert with the more-efficient processor, there\u2019s also a 25 percent larger battery with a 50Whr capacity, compared to the original\u2019s 40Whr. According to Valve, these changes combined result in a 30-50 percent increase in longevity between the two generations \u2014 the official battery life claim is \"three to 12 hours.\" In our review, we measured a playtime increase of 62 percent when playing Hades on the OLED model versus our 18-month-old original. (Batteries degrade over time, which explains why our gains were more pronounced.)\nThe new internals make the Steam Deck OLED marginally lighter, and also cooler to the touch when playing games, aided by a slightly larger fan. Other improvements include support for both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, together with a new antenna array that will give a better experience when using both at the same time. There\u2019s also a reworked power supply (it has a logo now!) with a longer 2.5m cable that will charge the OLED model from 20 to 80 percent in \u201cas little as 45 minutes.\u201d The thumbsticks have also been made 1mm taller, and the touch pads' haptics are slightly sharper.\nValve\nThe Steam Deck OLED starts at $549, and will replace all but the entry-level model in the range. The immediate reality is a bit of a mess and a little complicated, but this, Valve says, will be the Steam Deck line-up moving forward:\n256GB Steam Deck LCD ($399)\n512GB Steam Deck OLED ($549)\n1TB Steam Deck OLED ($649)\nAs a result of the changes, the 64GB LCD Steam Deck (previously sold at $399) will drop to $349, and the 512GB LCD (previously $649) will drop to $499. Once Valve sells through its inventory of both, those lines will be discontinued. Valve says it will continue to support all LCD models with software updates.\nSo, the long-term lineup starts at the same $399 price, which gets you the old LCD Steam Deck, but with 256GB of storage instead of 64GB. The new step-up model costs $20 more at $549, but comes with an OLED display and the improvements outlined above, plus double the storage. The range still tops out at $649, but you\u2019re getting a lot more for your money: All of the hardware improvements, 1TB of storage instead of 512GB and an improved carry case that can pop out into a slimmer shell that\u2019s smaller and easier to fit in a bag. As mentioned, it also has the same anti-glare etched glass as the outgoing 512GB LCD model.\nFinally, there\u2019s also a Limited Edition version of the 1TB model, with a translucent shell and a customized carry case, which will be sold at $679. We imagine stocks will not last very long, as it looks pretty rad:\nValve\nWhile there are no concrete updates on future hardware developments, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais noted that, so long as interest in handheld gaming remains high, the company has \"plans for successive generations of handhelds.\" For now, Griffais explained, it's important to Valve that developers don't need to \"split their attention\" between different performance targets.\nWhen asked about the potential for future hardware \u2014 like a return of the Steam Machine or an updated Steam Controller \u2014 there were no firm updates, but there does seem to be something happening. Griffais agreed that enabling the Steam Deck to work as a hybrid living room console was a \"side goal\" of the team, and noted that everything Valve does to improve SteamOS will benefit other devices. Coomer added that Valve is still working internally on \"a bunch of controllers and prototypes.\" If SteamOS is being used on larger displays, the team would want to augment that experience with better input options. \"We don't have any announcements on that front, but it's why we're building prototypes and thinking about the future there,\" Coomer said.\nThe Steam Deck OLED will be available to order on November 16th at 1PM ET. Valve expects units to begin shipping as soon as orders start to roll in. The updated pricing on the existing LCD models is already in effect.\n\nThis article, authored by Jessica Conditt,Aaron Souppouris, was published by Engadget on 2023-11-09 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":524}
{"title":"EU says incoming rules for general purpose AIs can evolve over time","context":"## EU says incoming rules for general purpose AIs can evolve over time\n\nThe political deal clinched by European Union lawmakers late Friday over what the bloc is billing as world\u2019s first comprehensive law for regulating artificial intelligence includes powers for the Commission to adapt the pan-EU AI rulebook to keep pace with developments in the cutting edge field, it has confirmed.\nLawmakers\u2019 choice of term for regulating the most powerful models behind the current boom in generative AI tools \u2014 which the EU Act refers to as \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d AI models and systems, rather than using industry terms of choice, like \u201cfoundational\u201d or \u201cfrontier\u201d models \u2014 was also selected with an eye on futureproofing the incoming law, per the Commission, with co-legislators favoring a generic term to avoid a classification that could be chained to use of a specific technology (i.e. transformer based machine learning).\n\u201cIn the future, we may have different technical approaches. And so we were looking for a more generic term,\u201d a Commission official suggested today. \u201cFoundation models, of course, are part of the general purpose AI models. These are models that can be used for a very large variety of tasks, they can also be integrated in systems. To give you a concrete example, the general purpose AI model would be GPT-4 and the general purpose AI system would be ChatGPT \u2014 where GPT-4 is integrated in ChatGPT.\u201d\nAs we reported earlier, the deal agreed by the bloc\u2019s co-legislators includes a low risk tier and a high risk tier for regulating so-called general purpose AIs (GPAIs) \u2014 such as models behind the viral boom in generative AI tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. The trigger for high risk rules to apply on generative AI technologies is determined by an initial threshold set out in the law.\nAlso as we reported Thursday, the agreed draft of the EU AI Act references the amount of compute used to train the models, aka floating point operations (or FLOPs) \u2014 setting the bar for a GPAI to be considered to have \u201chigh impact capabilities\u201d at 10^25 FLOPs.\nBut during a technical briefing with journalists today to review the political deal the Commission confirmed this is just an \u201cinitial threshold\u201d, affirming it will have powers to update the threshold over time via implementing\/delegating acts (i.e. secondary legislation). It also said the idea is for the FLOPs threshold to be combined, over time, with \u201cother benchmarks\u201d that will be developed by a new expert oversight body to be set up within the Commission, called the AI Office.\nWhy was 25 FLOPs selected as the high risk threshold for GPAIs? The Commission suggests the figure was picked with the intention of capturing current gen frontier models. However it claimed lawmakers did not discuss nor even considered whether it would apply to any models currently in play, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 or Google\u2019s Gemini, during the marathon trilogues to agree the final shape of the rulebook.\nA Commission official added that it will, in any case, be up to makers of GPAIs to self assess whether their models meet the FLOPs threshold and, therefore, whether they fall under the rules for GPAIs \u201cwith systemic risk\u201d or not.\n\u201cThere are no official sources that will say ChatGPT or Gemini or Chinese models are at this level of FLOPs,\u201d the official said during the press briefing. \u201cOn the basis of the information we have and with this 10^25 that we have chosen we have chosen a number that could really capture, a little bit, the frontier models that we have. Whether this is capturing GPT-4 or Gemini or others we are not here now to assert \u2014 because also, in our framework, it is the companies that would have to come and self assess what the amount of FLOPs or the computing capacity they have used. But, of course, if you read the scientific literature, many will point to these numbers as being very much the most advanced models at the moment. We will see what the companies will assess because they\u2019re the best placed to make this assessment.\u201d\n\u201cThe rules have not been written keeping in mind certain companies,\u201d they added. \u201cThey\u2019ve really been written with the idea of defining the threshold \u2014 which, by the way, may change because we have the possibility to be empowered to change this threshold on the basis of technological evolution. It could go up, it could go down and we could also develop other benchmarks that in the future will be the more appropriate to benchmark the different moments.\u201d\nGPAIs that fall in the AI Act\u2019s high risk tier will face ex ante-style regulatory requirements to assess and mitigate systemic risks \u2014 meaning they must proactively test model outputs to shrink risks of actual (or \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d) negative effects on public health, safety, public security, fundamental rights, or for society as a whole.\nWhile \u201clow tier\u201d GPAIs will only face lighter transparency requirements, including obligations to apply watermarking to generative AI outputs.\nThe watermarking requirement for GPAIs falls in an article that was in the original Commission version of the risk-based framework, presented all the way back in April 2021, which focused on transparency requirements for technologies such as AI chatbots and deepfakes \u2014 but which will now also apply generally to general purpose AI systems.\n\u201cThere is an obligation to try to watermark [generative AI-produced] text on the basis of the latest state of the art technology that is available,\u201d the Commission official said, fleshing out details of the agreed watermarking obligations. \u201cAt the moment, technologies are much better at watermarking videos and audio than watermarking text. But what we ask is the fact that this watermarking takes place on the basis of state of the art technology \u2014 and then we expect, of course, that over time the technology will mature and will be as [good] as possible.\u201d\nGPAI model makers must also commit to respecting EU copyright rules, including complying with an existing machine readable opt-out from text and data mining contained in the EU Copyright Directive \u2014 and a carve-out of the Act\u2019s transparency requirements for open source GPAIs does not extend to cutting them loose from the copyright obligations, with the Commission confirming the Copyright Directive will still apply on open source GPAIs.\nAs regards the AI Office, which will play a key role in setting risk classification thresholds for GPAIs, the Commission confirmed there\u2019s no budget nor headcount defined for the expert body as yet. (Although, in the small hours of Saturday morning the bloc\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, suggested the EU is set to welcome \u201ca lot\u201d of new colleagues as it tools up this general purpose AI oversight body.)\nAsked about resourcing for the AI Office, a Commission official said it will be decided in the future by the EU\u2019s executive taking \u201can appropriate and official decision\u201d. \u201cThe idea is that we can create a dedicated budget line for the Office and that we will be able also to recruit the national experts from Member States if we wish to on top of contractual agents and on top of permanent staff. And some of these staff will also be deployed within the European Commission,\u201d they added.\nThe AI Office will work in conjunction with a new scientific advisory panel the law will also establish to aid the body to better understand the capabilities of advanced AI models for the purpose of regulating systemic risk. \u201cWe have identified an important role for a scientific panel to be set up where the scientific panel can effectively help the Artificial Intelligence Office in understanding whether there are new risks that have not been yet identified,\u201d the official noted. \u201cAnd, for example, also flag some alerts about the models that are not captured by the FLOP threshold that for certain reasons could actually give rise to important risks that governments should should look at.\u201d\nWhile the EU\u2019s executive seems keen to ensure key details of the incoming law are put out there in spite of there being no final text yet \u2014 because work to consolidate what was agreed by co-legislators during the marathon 38 hour talks that ended on Friday night is the next task facing the bloc over the coming weeks \u2014 there could still be some devils lurking in that detail. So it will be worth scrutinizing the text that emerges, likely in January or February.\nAdditionally, while the full regulation won\u2019t be up and running for a few years the EU will be pushing for GPAIs to abide by codes of practice in the meanwhile \u2014 so AI giants will be under pressure to stick as close to the hard regulations coming down the pipe as possible, via the bloc\u2019s AI Pact.\nThe EU AI Act itself likely won\u2019t be in full force until some time in 2026 \u2014 given the final text must, once compiled (and translated into Member States\u2019 languages), be affirmed by final votes in the parliament and Council, after which there\u2019s a short period before the text of the law is published in the EU\u2019s Official Journal and another before it comes into force.\nEU lawmakers have also agreed a phased approach to the Act\u2019s compliance demands, with 24 months allowed before the high risk rules will apply for GPAIs.\nThe list of strictly prohibited use-cases of AI will apply sooner, just six months after the law enters into force \u2014 which could, potentially, mean bans on certain \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d uses of AI, such as social scoring or Clearview AI-style selfie scraping for facial recognition databases, will get up and running in the second half of 2024, assuming no last minute opposition to the regulation springs up within the Council or Parliament. (For the full list of banned AI uses, read our earlier post.)\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-11 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":525}
{"title":"Apple 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro review: A desktop among laptops","context":"## Apple 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro review: A desktop among laptops\n\nThis thing is a beast \u2014 in pretty much every sense. It\u2019s a big, heavy, powerful system, with a bright display, massive battery life and impressive power under the hood. After opening the box, I immediately ported all the contents over from the 15-inch Air I\u2019ve been using daily for several months now, but still, the 16-inch MacBook Pro feels like a different species.\nEach has their place. I\u2019m hopping on another cross-country flight tomorrow, and I\u2019m planning to leave the 16-inch Pro at home. This is due partially to an ongoing back injury, but frankly, for as good as the Pro\u2019s battery life is (very good, for the record), the Air is a much better travel companion. It\u2019s thin, it\u2019s light, it has more than enough processing power for 95% of the things 95% of people need, and it won\u2019t wrestle you for the arm rest.\nI\u2019ve begun thinking of the 16-inch MacBook Pro as something more along the lines of a portable desktop. That is to say that the M3 Max is plenty powerful for even most professional uses. The chip also affords the laptop the ability to power up to four external displays, making it a fine workstation option for many. When it\u2019s time to take your work home (assuming you don\u2019t live in France), you can pop it in your bag and take it with you. I would recommend against taking your work (and large laptop) home with you every night, but you do you.\nhttps:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/11\/06\/apple-imac-m3-review\/\nThe new MacBook Pro, which goes on sale this week, was announced at last week\u2019s Scary Fast event, alongside a new iMac and \u2014 of course \u2014 several members of the M3 line. That latter bit marked a big departure for the company, following rumors that Apple had planned the initial M3 launch for WWDC. The supply chain ultimately thought different(ly). What announcing the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max at once affords the company, however, is options \u2014 though less so for the M3-only iMac.\nBetween the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, you\u2019ve got all three configurations covered. Presumably an M3 Ultra is also on the way in the not-too-distant future, but will almost certainly be confined to desktops like the Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, owing to the limitations of system architectures. Apple also recently shot down rumors surrounding a 27-inch iMac. The 14-inch MacBook Pro can be configured with any of the three new chips, while the 16-inch is limited to just the Pro and Max.\nApple sent us the 16-inch with the M3 Max. The company, understandably, likes to put its best foot forward with this stuff (so yes, it\u2019s also the Space Black model). The Max comes in both 14-core CPU\/30-core GPU and 16-core CPU\/40-core GPU flavors. Again, the one I am typing this on falls into the latter camp. That also means 48GB of memory and 1TB of storage by default. It\u2019s a $4,000 computer, as configured. If you want to bump the memory and storage up to 128GB and 8TB, respectively, it comes to $7,200. That\u2019s a pretty hefty increase from the base level 14- and 16-inch models, which run $1,600 and $2,500 to start.\nApple lowered the barrier of entry for the lowest end model, but \u2014 as ever \u2014 upgrades start to add up quickly. We\u2019re talking about a real investment here for you \u2014 or better yet, your company. It\u2019s certainly a system that\u2019s likely to last you a while. It\u2019s true that Apple is currently on a one-year upgrade cycle for it first-party M-series chips, but it\u2019s genuinely tough to imagine and advanced as pronounced as the one it made from Intel to in-house silicon happening any time soon. There\u2019s no such thing as a future-proofed laptop, so the best you can hope for is one that will give you good mileage. That certainly applies here.\nAlong with building new chips, Apple has spent the last few years listening to consumers in a way it hadn\u2019t for decades. That means finally updating the camera, building a better keyboard (the class action settlement probably tipped the scales as well) and ditching the well-meaning but ultimately ineffectual Touch Bar altogether. In fact, it shouldn\u2019t go unremarked upon that the arrival of the new 14-inch signaled the merciful end to that particular technology, as the last Touch Bar Mac \u2014 the 13-inch Pro \u2014 was replaced by the new 14-inch model.\nDesign\nI would say, more than anything, the thing I miss moving from the MacBook Pro to the Air is the ports. True story: At last year\u2019s CES, I had to locate an Apple Store in the Venetian because my external SD reader failed (I won\u2019t say which TechCrunch staff member laughed at me in that predicament, but they know who they are). I understand that an SD reader is kind of a niche need in these days of everyone shooting everything on their, so I can at least understand Apple\u2019s justification for keeping it to the Pro system (the new iMac doesn\u2019t have one, either).\nPorts are a different story. More ports is better. It\u2019s simple math. People can\u2019t get enough of the things. The Pro has three Thunderbolt 4\/USB-C ports to the Air\u2019s two. Also, for some reason, all of the ports (save for the headphone jack) are all on the same side with the Air. Things can get crowded fast. Both systems have the latest MagSafe connector \u2014 though I\u2019d like to point out that despite being a bespoke charger, you\u2019re able to top the laptops up faster via Thunderbolt. The other important addition on the Pro side is an HDMI port, which is key for the aforementioned external display support.\nFrom an industrial design perspective, not much has changed here from the 2021 model. Apple settled into a look it likes, balancing rounded edges with a flat, almost boxy design that isn\u2019t dissimilar from the iPhone in that respect. On top is the familiar reflective Apple logo, while \u201cMacBook Pro\u201d is etched into the bottom. Around that, you\u2019ll see a series of small screws that signal the company\u2019s newfound push into repairability spurred on by the broader call for right to repair legislation. There is also a heat vent on either side.\nThe Pros are a good bit thicker than the Air. The 14- and 16-inch are 0.61 and 0.66 inches tall, respectively, versus the 15-inch Air\u2019s 0.45 inches. This is due, in no small part to the Pros\u2019 inclusion of a fan and airflow system. You\u2019re unlikely to trigger the fan during most everyday operations, but more complex tasks like 3D rendering require a lot of compute power, so it\u2019s there when you need it. Meanwhile, the 14-inch Pro (3.4 pounds) weighs just a hair more than the 15-inch Air (3.3 pounds). At 4.7\/4.8 pounds (for the M3 Pro and Max), there\u2019s a pronounced increase with the 16-inch Pro.\nApple fans love a new color. In the case of the MacBook line, it could be attributable to the fact that there\u2019s little variation in the laptops\u2019 aluminum design. The last few generations have traded almost exclusively in space gray and silver (dark and light gray, essentially). The new Airs opened this up a bit, however, with the addition of starlight (a subtle light-gold) and midnight (a much darker gray). The space black is a nice addition. It gives off a nice glow when the light hits it. The biggest thing here, however, is the fingerprint factor. The Airs I\u2019ve tested were silver and starlight, so I can\u2019t really speak to this directly, but the midnight Air is a notorious fingerprint magnet. There are pages and pages of conversations about it on Reddit, including \u201ctips\u201d for a fingerprint-free midnight Mac. Have you tried typing in gloves? Not easy.\nApple describes the new color in the most Apple way possible, \u201cThe finish features a breakthrough chemistry that forms an anodization seal to greatly reduce fingerprints.\u201d The company hasn\u2019t perfected the wholly fingerprint-proof surface, but the new finish does an excellent job keeping things to a minimum.\nCamera\nBoth new Pro models are built around Apple\u2019s Liquid Retina XDR display. The 14-inch sports 3024 x 1964 pixels to the 16\u2019s 3456 x 2234 pixels \u2014 both come out to a pixel density of 254 ppi. The 15-inch Air, meanwhile, has a 224 ppi density. The 16-inch system\u2019s display is largely unchanged from the 2021 model. It has a 1000 nit sustained brightness and 1600 nit peak with HDR (high dynamic range) content. For SDR (standard dynamic range) content, however, brightness has been bumped up from a 500 to 600 nits max.\nBack in April 2021, the company finally started bumping its webcams from 720p to 1080p. It was a long-awaited refresh for a company that puts so much emphasis on its mobile imaging. The new hardware was coupled with improvements brought on by the M1\u2019s on-board digital signal processing. While the camera hardware has remained the same since, updates to the chips have further tweaked picture quality. As it stands now, the webcam is totally fine, and the addition of portrait and studio lighting modes further improve its. Portrait mode does still have some trouble with edges. I wear over-ear headphones while podcasting, and it hasn\u2019t quit figured out what to do with the gap between the band and my head.\nFrankly, however, Apple\u2019s biggest enemy here is itself. Continuity Camera is a game changer for many. The system lets a mounted iPhone take over webcam duties, and there\u2019s really no comparing the two. I never go on a trip without the Belkin MagSafe camera mount.\nThe on-board speaker and microphone systems, meanwhile, remain mostly unchanged from the 2021 M1 Pro. There are six speakers, with two large grilles on either side of the keyboard. The system supports both Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos. It\u2019s not an exceptional speaker system, but it gets the job done. The Pro also has a three-mic array with directional beamforming.\nM3 Max\nThe M3 line is the first of Apple\u2019s desktop chips to be created using the 3nm process, following the iPhone 15 Pro\u2019s lead. Apple has employed the 5nm process since the 2020\u2019s M1 introduction. The new process brings performance gains with less power consumption, and the Mac is the first PC line to employ the technology.\nGaming continues to be an important narrative for Apple\u2019s silicon journey, and it was very much at the heart of last week\u2019s M3 announcements. GPU updates were the centerpiece of the news for several reasons. One is a feature the company calls Dynamic Caching. Apple writes,\nWith Dynamic Caching, only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. This is an industry first, transparent to developers, and the cornerstone of the new GPU architecture. It dramatically increases the average utilization of the GPU, which significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.\nMore simply put, the idea is allocating just the right amount of local memory to a given task. It\u2019s something Apple has been working on for a while. The other two additions should be more familiar for anyone who\u2019s spent time behind a game controller. The first is ray tracing, a feature designed to bring added realism to the gaming experience, though more accurate depictions of lighting and reflections.\nThat feature is now hardware-accelerated, along with mesh shading. The triangle computer shader makes processing complex geometrical images more efficient. That, in turn, allows for higher-quality graphics and more scene detail.\nThe results are impressive. I\u2019ve been spending a bit of time with the Soulslike title, Lies of P. It\u2019s basically Pinocchio with more swords. It\u2019s of a small \u2013 but increasing \u2013 number of day-and-date releases for macOS. A couple of years ago, it would have been inconceivable for the operating system to get the game the same day as PS5, Xbox Series X\/S and Windows. That said, the macOS gaming library still has a long way to go.\nIndeed, the gameplay was smooth and detailed \u2013 something that also would have seemed impossible not all that long ago. Sony\u2019s PS5 DualShock controller connects seamlessly and makes for a fun portable gaming experience.\nOne thing I noticed during last week\u2019s presentation is that Apple is leaning less heavily on Intel comparisons. There were still a few during the event, but four-year-old non-proprietary chips are no longer the main point of comparison. Enough time and upgrades have elapsed since the M1 arrived. In fact, this Friday marks three years since it was announced. Apple again,\nRendering speeds are now up to 2.5x faster than on the M1 family of chips. The CPU performance cores and efficiency cores are 30 percent and 50 percent faster than those in M1, respectively, and the Neural Engine is 60 percent faster than the Neural Engine in the M1 family of chips.\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out here that Apple\u2019s chip numbering system isn\u2019t as straight forward as it seems at first blush. For instance, while the M3 represents an advance over the M2, you can still expect to see, say, the M2 Ultra to outperform the M3. Pros, Maxes and Ultras are progressively larger versions of their baseline chip, containing more CPU, GPU and neural engine cores. The Ultra, for example, is for all in intents and purposes, two Maxes stitched together. There are other factors at play as well, like the fact that Mac Studio and Mac Pro do a better job with heat dissipation, while the MacBook Pros are more equipped than the fan-less Airs, which throttle performance more quickly due to heat.\nThere are still a handful of ways, however, that even the baseline M3 will outperform the M2 Ultra. Two clear instances are ray tracing and mesh shading, which were previously software-accelerated.\nWith Blackmagic Disk Speed, which measures SSD performance, the 16-inch Pro scored 6367 write and 5057 read speeds, vs. the Mac Studio\u2019s 6648\/5716. Running Geekbench 6, the system scored 3149 on the single-core test and 21269 multi-core. That\u2019s a nice bump over the M3 iMac\u2019s 3024\/11810. In our Mac Studio review, the M2 Ultra got 2819 single and 21507 multi-core. Taking a step back in time to Geekbench 5 (which we\u2019ve been running on M-series systems from the outset), the M3 Max gets a single-core score of 2323 and 23190 on the multi-core. That\u2019s a big performance increase over the M3 iMac\u2019s 2191\/10619 and the M2 Max 14-inch Pro\u2018s 1952\/15249.\nThe M3 Max powering our Pro sports 16 CPU cores \u2014 that\u2019s 12 performance and 4 efficiency \u2014 while the GPU packs in a whopping 40 cores. On Cinebench 2024, it scored 142 for single-core and 1693 with the multi-core, compared to the M3 Max\u2019s 138\/617. You can see a pattern emerging. The M3 Max outperforms the M3 on everything (no surprise there) and the M2 Ultra on several single-core tests, while often coming within spitting distance with some of the multi-core tests.\nWith GeekBench 6 Metal, which tests GPU performance during complex tasks, the M3 Max scored an average of 153273. That\u2019s a nice increase over the M2 Max\u2019s 131883 average, while still getting trounced by the M2 Ultra\u2019s 208584. AMD\u2019s cards still best even the top-performing Apple chips by a good margin, with the Radeon RX 6900XT scoring 242924.\nRelative to its own family of chips, the M3 Max is doing impressive things, given that the M2 Ultra tops out at a 24-core CPU, 76-core GPU and 32-core neural engine. The Mac Studio\u2019s large body and airflow system are also much more equipped to dissipate heat, when compared to the MacBook Pro\u2019s compact profile. I will say, however, that I have so far only triggered the fan during benchmarking. The Cinebench test was run with the system in high-power mode, a setting that prioritizes performance over battery life. Low-power mode, naturally, does the inverse, while automatic (the default setting) does its best to split the difference.\nAnd Finally\nHonestly, though, the battery might be the most exceptional bit here. The first thing I did upon receiving the system (after setup and charging) was a video rundown \u2014 far and away the most lengthy part of testing. I looped a single movie (Bill & Ted Face the Music, for the record) in Apple TV, with brightness and volume at their default settings. I kicked it off at 4:45PM on Tuesday, and it ran until 7:30 the following evening. That\u2019s a runtime of 26 hours, 45 minutes. This thing is going to get you through your next flight, no problem.\nHowever, if you\u2019re flying a lot and want a MacBook travel companion, I still recommend the 15-inch Air. It continues to be the best MacBook for the vast majority of users. The 14-inch Pro is worth looking at gaming is important \u2014 though I\u2019m still a long way off from recommending any Macs are pure gaming machines. The 16-inch is the pick for those who really need to up their professional game, but still need some portability. For pure desktop power, the Mac Studio and Mac Pro with the M2 Ultra is still king \u2014 until the M3 Ultra rolls out.\nTo state the obvious, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Max is the most powerful Apple laptop, ever. You\u2019ll still get more performance out of the M2 Ultra in the Mac Studio, but for most intents and purposes, this is the desktop of laptops. It\u2019s big, heavy, expensive and powerful.\n\nThis article, authored by Brian Heater, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-06 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":526}

Learn more.\nTV and Soundbar Deals\nSamsung S95C Photograph: Samsung\nThe Samsung S95C (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite TVs, thanks to its quantum dot OLED panel, which gives it perfect black levels and a ridiculously bright image. It even comes with an excellent centered pedestal mount that makes it easy to place in your living room.\nFor gamers, the LG C3 is our top TV pick. Beyond the usual benefits of LG's OLED panels, like perfect black levels, it has features that are appealing for gaming, including a 120-Hz refresh rate for super smooth gameplay and 9.2 millisecond response time to reduce any input lag during fast-paced games.\nOne of the best upgrades you can make to your TV is adding a soundbar to replace the mediocre speakers built into the TV itself. This soundbar from Polk is one of our favorites. It comes with a subwoofer that boosts all those deep, booming notes Christopher Nolan likes so much, and it has several audio presets that can tune the sound based on what type of media you're watching.\nKeyboard Deals\nNZXT Function Photograph: NZXT\nIf you're interested in mechanical keyboards but aren't sure where to start, the NZXT Function (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great jumping-off point. It has a stylish design, and you can configure things like switches and keycaps at the time of purchase. It also comes with tools to modify the keyboard later if you prefer.\nIf you like mechanical keyboards that are loud enough to register on remote seismic detectors, the Roccat Vulcan 121 is our pick for you. The switches on this board are illuminated from below and are semi-clear, giving it a bold look to match its staggeringly loud clicky switches (in a good way).\nThe Logitech G915 is one of my personal favorite keyboards, in no small part due to Logitech's powerful G Hub software that makes automating tasks for productivity dead simple. It's designed for gamers, but it's also useful if you spend a lot of time with creative tools like DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, Blender, Cinema 4D, and other high-end media-production tools.\nRoccat Vulcan II Mini Photograph: Best Buy\nThis is one of our favorite keyboards, with twice as many LEDs as usual. Specifically, it has two LEDs per switch, giving it cosmetic benefits like smoother color animations and the occasional functional benefit, like the ability to indicate when a mute toggle is enabled.\nClick the coupon button to see the discount at checkout. This keyboard is specifically great for fans of the NumPad. It's made of high-quality plastic and has hot-swappable switches, and it comes with satisfying tactile switches. This deal is pretty modest, but this keyboard rarely goes on sale, so it's worth taking a look.\nGaming Mice Deals\nSteelSeries Prime Wireless Mouse Photograph: SteelSeries\nThis mouse is our top pick overall for gaming mice. It's light, comfortable for a wide variety of hand sizes and shapes, and features a couple of extra buttons without becoming cluttered. It is designed with esports professionals in mind, meaning it has nice, clicky buttons, hyper-fast response time, and solid wireless connectivity even around 10 feet away from the receiver.\nThis gaming mouse has a comfortable chassis; extra thumb buttons; and, perhaps most importantly, a modest price. Even when it's not on sale, it's one of our more affordable picks, and this deal just makes it even more accessible.\nOther Tech Deals\nAnker Prime Photograph: Anker\nAnker is kicking off its Black Friday sale early with discounts and a buy-one-get-another-50-percent-off promotion. Make sure you use the listed code to snag the discounted price for each product. We generally like most Anker gear, but standouts include the Anker Prime power bank and the Anker Nano Power Bank. Anker's tiny 511 30-watt charger is also excellent.\nThe Google Pixel Buds A-Series (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) are our top overall earbuds pick. For nearly everyone\u2013even some iPhone users\u2013these check every box. They get up to five hours of battery life (plus an extra 19 hours via recharging in their carrying case), IPX4 water resistance for workouts, and nearly instant pairing with Android devices. This is a solid deal, but they do dip to $59 during major sale events, so it might be worth waiting for Black Friday.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro Photograph: Samsung\nFor Samsung owners, the Galaxy Buds2 Pro (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) are one of our top earbud picks. They produce excellent sound quality, with a super comfortable fit and IPX7 water resistance. They don't have the multi-device connectivity that we like on the Pixel Buds A-Series, but if you mainly use your earbuds with a Samsung phone, these are a great fit for you.\nA slightly more affordable version of the above, the Galaxy Buds2 (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) are another one of our picks for Android users. They're similar in price to the standard AirPods and get five hours of battery life with active noise canceling turned on and an impressive 7.5 hours with it turned off. They come with a charging case and deliver solid bass via their dual-driver array. This deal is only on the olive green color model.\n\nThis article, authored by Eric Ravenscraft, was published by Wired on 2023-10-19 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":527}
{"title":"Amazon\u2019s Tye Brady discusses generative AI, humanoid robots and mobile manipulation","context":"## Amazon\u2019s Tye Brady discusses generative AI, humanoid robots and mobile manipulation\n\nA version of this post first appeared in TechCrunch\u2019s weekly robotics newsletter, Actuator. Subscribe here.\nLast week was a busy one for robotics. We had RoboBusiness in the Bay, ROSCon in New Orleans and Amazon\u2019s Delivering the Future event in Seattle. I ended up choosing the latter, as I\u2019d gotten quite a bit out of the 2022 version of the event, held at a fulfillment center outside of Boston.\nThis year\u2019s event was two days. The first was held inside the Spheres, the big, glass pair of geodesic domes outside the company\u2019s South Lake Union headquarters. The spaces are actually multifloor functional greenhouses, so it\u2019s a bit of a temperature adjustment coming in from Seattle October weather. That said, it\u2019s pretty great being inside a muggy glass structure in the rain \u2014 an opportunity one gets only 150 or so days a year.\nAmazon made a number of announcements on the robotics front this year. At the top of the list was a pair of news items revolving around the Prime Air service. Starting this year, customers in College Station, Texas, will be able to get medications from Amazon Pharmacy delivered via drone.\nNext year, the service will launch in a third U.S. city, as well as yet-to-be-named spots in the U.K. and Germany. The service had its share of ups and downs over the years (so to speak), including layoffs in 2020 and company-wide job cuts earlier this year. Amazon is, understandably, approaching the project with baby steps. It\u2019s currently limited to one city in Texas and another in California.\nAside from difficulties scaling, there\u2019s also a whole bunch of regulation to contend with. Amazon has worked with local and national governing bodies to ensure the same day delivery service complies. In a lot of ways, this is a bit of a brave new world, and there are bound to be some stumbles on the way to a potential future where delivery drones from companies like Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s Wing are a common sight in the skies above our heads.\nOne thing Amazon has going for it on the pharmacy front is the fact that it doesn\u2019t trade in narcotics, meaning that opioids won\u2019t be flying over anyone\u2019s heads. Also, the company is going to start rolling out the new MK30 drone, which it claims is significantly quieter than the last model. Again, this is an important thing if we\u2019re planning to have these things buzzing around the skies.\nAlso worth pointing out is the arrival of the brand-new first-party system, Sequoia. The company notes:\nSequoia allows us to identify and store inventory we receive at our fulfillment centers up to 75% faster than we can today. This means we can list items for sale on Amazon.com more quickly, benefiting both sellers and customers. When orders are placed, Sequoia also reduces the time it takes to process an order through a fulfillment center by up to 25%, which improves our shipping predictability and increases the number of goods we can offer for Same-Day or Next-Day shipping. Obviously this is all a matter of reducing delivery times \u2014 also the driving factor in the company\u2019s Prime Air investments. The company has already set next- and same-day delivery expectations in many areas, so one wonders when we arrive at the point where any additional time savings becomes effectively negligible. I suspect if you were to put the question to Amazon, they would say \u201cnever.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t get to that specific question during my time with Amazon Robotics chief technologist, Tye Brady. Instead, our conversation primarily focused on three important (I think) topics. The first is the company\u2019s pilots with Agility\u2019s Digit systems. I wrote about this a couple of times last week, including a piece titled \u201cHumanoid robots face a major test with Amazon\u2019s Digit pilots\u201d that went up over the weekend.\nI do genuinely believe there are going to be a lot of eyes on this thing. It\u2019s not that I think it\u2019s the end of Agility if Amazon opts not to extend a contract. It\u2019s more that if Amazon decides to pursue it further, it\u2019s going to cause a lot more companies to take bipedal\/humanoid robots a lot more seriously. I\u2019ve been saying the whole time that I\u2019m holding off on judging the efficacy of humanoids until we see more in the field, and Amazon clearly feels the same way.\nThe company operates at such an unfathomable scale (have you visited a regional fulfillment center lately?), that it truly needs to feel absolutely confident before it begins implementing new technologies into its workflows.\nAnother noteworthy piece of news is an Amazon, MIT\/Ipsos partnership designed to gauge what both workers and consumers think about industrial robots.\n\u201cThe key to effective teamwork is building a shared understanding of what our partners will do and what they will need to be successful,\u201d says MIT\u2019s Julie Shah. \u201cOur research shows that the best way to optimize human-robot team performance is to develop robots that are active collaborators in helping a human to learn about their capabilities, limitations and behaviors.\u201d\nI do think human perception of robots is a question worth asking, but I would love to see a study with such financial and academic resources digging more deeply into questions around short- and long-term displacements.\nDuring his presentation, Brady addressed the jobs question accordingly:\nWe have more than 750,000 mobile robots in our operations and thousands of other robotic systems that help move, sort, identify and package customer orders. It\u2019s taken us more than 10 years to reach this scale. During that time, Amazon has hired hundreds of thousands of employees to work in our operations. We take a purpose-driven approach to how we design and deploy technology at our facilities and we consistently prioritize using robots to support safety and ease everyday tasks for our employees.\nOne other bit before we move on to the interview. At the top of the second day, an Amazon rep noted, \u201cEvery one of our teams is working on building generative AI applications.\u201d That jumped out at me, for obvious reasons, but as the event pressed on into specifics around drone and robotics plans, the topic largely fell away.\nI kicked off my conversation with Tye Brady with a few questions on the subject.\nThe subject of generative AI came up earlier in the day, but it was largely absent from the robotics conversations. How is your team thinking about the subject?\nI\u2019ll talk about machine learning and then generative AI. I think that Amazon has been at the forefront of machine learning for decades now. As you can imagine, early on with Jeff [Bezos], if you needed to predict where inventory needed to go, one person couldn\u2019t do that. We\u2019ve involved machine learning as part of that, from the get-go. AWS has the Machine Learning Toolkit. Now that involves generative AI, and there\u2019s over 100,000 businesses that are using that toolset today. We\u2019re seeing where it\u2019s going. We have what we call Codewhisperer that will help us in our actual coding of the robotic systems.\nReal language?\nExactly right. If you\u2019re trying to do this procedure or routine, it suggests you can write your subroutine this way. Cut and paste it. Very straightforward, very easy. It helps with the overall productivity. In robotics, generative AI has a lot of promise. One example that\u2019s in my lab today is that we generate synthetic packages that are virtually indistinguishable from any picture you see. Generative AI will generate scenes, like what the robot would see with the right lighting condition. In simulation, we can pick up those generated packages with real-world contact force, all the way through with the actual perception system that\u2019s in the field. We can even damage a corner in different ways to make sure our detection algorithms are actually working the way they should.\nAnother one is grasp affordance. That\u2019s a term we use in order to pick up an object and what\u2019s the orientation and the pose of the end effector that you want in order to grab that object? Generative AI has a lot of possibilities there. As you can imagine, a set of basic primitives, where we then give a generative AI agent all of the options that we can do with our robotic end effectors. Why don\u2019t we stitch those together in a meaningful way?\nTo help determine the best method for picking.\nExactly. That ultimately helps our designers determine and algorithmically prove that was the best method. The theme here is that generative AI has a lot of promise, particularly in influencing our designers to make a better system.\nI was recently speaking with Daniela Rus, and she was excited by the concept of using generative AI to literally design robots.\nThe dynamics of the robots, to literally move the robots \u2014 path planning to actually figure out how to get the right angles \u2014 generative AI is incredible at that. We\u2019re seeing a lot of promise with that today.\nWhat about real-world problem-solving?\nIt\u2019s another good example. I want to be careful on generative AI versus the machine learning systems that we have. We have what we call \u201cflow\u201d inside the building. We have machine learning systems that understand what line needs what at what time and can help divert the right material flow to the right stations, for example. We have machine learning systems that I think of as air traffic controllers for all the mobile drives that we have.\nFleet management.\nFleet management, task management, work management. On top of that, machine learning has completely changed computer vision, like the segmentation of objects \u2014 knowing where one object ends and the next begins.\nYou\u2019re using simulation, but there are always things you\u2019re not going to account for. I\u2019ve heard it said that generative is potentially useful for having robots make decisions for scenarios they haven\u2019t encountered on the fly.\nYeah. That\u2019s been part of robotics for decades, the ability to make real-time decisions. It\u2019s something that, even prior to generative AI, enabled the goods-to-person fulfillment systems we had. Even with Sequoia, there\u2019s real time sensing capabilities that are built in that can detect objects and people. That needs to be in the robot, and then there\u2019s stuff that we hold in AWS in the cloud that has the higher level of logic. It\u2019s exciting to think about the capabilities of generative AI, and I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. We always think in practical real-world examples inside of Amazon Robotics. But we\u2019re so far pretty interested, particularly if we give primitives to our systems and then allow generative AI to stitch those together in ways that can make those real-time decisions. That has proven very useful, both in our mobility and manipulation solutions.\nAround April, you announced that Agility would be one of the first recipients in the Industrial Innovation Fund. Is potential warehouse integration a piece of making those investments?\nThe Innovation Fund is really about exploring what\u2019s possible out there. It\u2019s about understanding practical real-world examples as well. We are interested in walking robots. I find that very interesting, the ability to move on different terrains is interesting. We\u2019re also interested in what works \u2014 and frankly what doesn\u2019t work \u2014 about it. The humanoid form is really interesting. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing. We\u2019re experimentalists at heart. We\u2019re gonna figure that out. We\u2019re going to do a pilot and see how that works out. We\u2019re happy that they\u2019re a part of our fund, but we also have other companies in the fund where we learned from, and if we want, we can make a larger investment in it. I\u2019m not necessary saying that if we fund something, it\u2019s going to be inside our processes. It\u2019s very early stages.\nWhat does \u201cvery early stage\u201d mean here?\nWe\u2019re learning about the function and utility. What\u2019s possible here? What\u2019s hype? What\u2019s reality? Would this possibly scale? I think a lot of folks have difficulty understaning the scale in which we operate. It can\u2019t work 99% of the time, because a 1% defect rate is a huge number inside any of our buildings.\nIt\u2019s clear looking at your progress on projects like Proteus that the goal is to move automation outside the cage.\nWe\u2019re moving outside the cage. What we can see with those investments is in 2022, as compared to manual buildings, we\u2019ve reduced the recordable injury rate by 15%.\nWith these sorts of deals like Agility, do you buy a number of robots outright for the testing? Are you leasing them?\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all. We do a case-by-case basis. [Amazon declined to comment further on the arrangement.]\nOne of the big appeals of bipedal robots is their ability to operate in brownfield settings, but Amazon doesn\u2019t really have that problem.\nOur interest in systems like Agility is in the bipedal nature. The walking nature of that. Whether it\u2019s two legs, four legs, or it\u2019s rolling on wheels. If it performs that mobility function, we have interest, because we know that we need to move goods.\nBut given Amazon\u2019s immense resources, you\u2019re able to build factories, ground up.\nThat\u2019s a good observation. The Sequoia system that you see is actually built for the height of our prior Kiva pods. If we wanted to retrofit buildings, we have that capability. We can containerize that building to bring the safety and productivity benefits to existing sites. We can retrofit brownfields that we\u2019ve already built with the Sequoia system. We have greenfield and brownfield. Not everything is a greenfield.\n750,000 is a lot of robots.\nAll manufactured by Amazon and built in the state of Massachusetts.\nDo you break those numbers down further?\nThose are just the AMRs. We also have a fleet of robots that sort packages. We have a fleet of robots that manipulate packages, like our Robin fleet that\u2019s inducted more than 2 billion packages.\nYou mentioned mobile manipulation earlier. Where is your team with that concept?\nIt\u2019s super exciting. I think those core fundamentals that I talked about, the verbs that I think we\u2019re achieving a world class mastering in, when you start to bring those together in interesting combination, some really unique things happen. I think that we are world leaders when it comes to mobile robots out there. No one has the fleet of sure mobile industrial robots that are out there and controlling them at scale. And now we are very much in the business of manipulating not only packages, but also objects. And to bring those together, I think it\u2019s exciting to see the possibilities.\nWhat does mobile manipulation look like?\nI think it\u2019s probably what you think.\nMounting an arm to an AMR?\nYeah. With the Agility robot, you can think of that as a mobile manipulator. That has interest to us, right. The mode of mobility has particular interest to us because we just have not done a lot of work in bipedal robots. So that\u2019s why we have interest in Agility. But absolutely, if we can combine that with identification systems with manipulation systems, sortation system, storage systems have anything and everything that we will do to innovate for our customer, right anything and everything will do to improve the safety for our employees.\nIt\u2019s a hard problem.\nIt\u2019s a very, very hard problem, when you\u2019re talking about millions and millions of different objects. Of all different sizes, and scales and weights in dimensionality, the ability to not only grasp the item, but also identify the item, the ability to also look for damage on the item is pretty incredible. I want to eliminate every menial, mundane, repetitive job out there. So, if I can automate that, and allow our employees to focus more on what matters, on higher level tasking, that\u2019s a total win. This ties into the MIT thing, too. The way it\u2019s played out is, you replace a certain thing. So the jobs changed. The jobs exist, but it\u2019s a big sweeping change.\nIf I visit the labs, I\u2019ll see these sorts of experiments in action.\nYeah. If you were to go to outside of Nashville today, you would see Proteus working with our Cardinal arm. You\u2019d get to see the interoperability. We have the Proteus drives moving carts to the outbound docks. If you were to go down to Hou 6 just outside of Houston, you would see Sequoia fulfilling orders today, right in time for holiday shopping.\nWhat role do people play in that picture?\nPeople will always be at the center of a robotics universe. We know more robots, more jobs that we see through the productivity increases that we have.\n[The MIT study] sounds like it\u2019s largely about perception and what people think of robots, rather than job numbers specifically.\nI\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s wherever [MIT professor Julie Shah] wants to take it. We have a lot of interest in how people perceive robotics, because people will be using our robotics. And if it is intimidating, or there\u2019s friction there, and you don\u2019t want to use it, then we\u2019re failing in our design.\n\nThis article, authored by Brian Heater, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-28 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":528}
{"title":"Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president","context":"## Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president\n\nA judge ruled Tuesday that Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame and the White House.\nJudge Arthur Engoron, ruling in a civil lawsuit brought by New York\u2019s attorney general, found that the former president and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing.\nEngoron ordered that some of Trump\u2019s business licenses be rescinded as punishment and said he would continue to have an independent monitor oversee the Trump Organization\u2019s operations.\nA Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. Trump has long insisted he did nothing wrong.\nThe decision, days before the start of a non-jury trial in Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit, is the strongest repudiation yet of Trump\u2019s carefully coiffed image as a wealthy and shrewd real estate mogul turned political powerhouse.\nBeyond mere bragging about his riches, Trump, his company and key executives repeatedly lied about them on his annual financial statements, reaping rewards such as favorable loan terms and lower insurance premiums, Engoron found.\nThose tactics crossed a line and violated the law, the judge said, rejecting Trump\u2019s contention that a disclaimer on the financial statements absolved him of any wrongdoing.\n\u201cIn defendants\u2019 world: rent regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party\u2019s lies,\u201d Engoron wrote in his 35-page ruling. \u201cThat is a fantasy world, not the real world.\u201d\nManhattan prosecutors had looked into bringing a criminal case over the same conduct but declined to do so, leaving James to sue Trump and seek penalties that could disrupt his and his family\u2019s ability to do business in the state.\nEngoron\u2019s ruling, in a phase of the case known as summary judgment, resolves the key claim in James\u2019 lawsuit, but six others remain.\nEngoron is slated to hold a non-jury trial starting Oct. 2 before deciding on those claims and any punishments he may impose. James is seeking $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump doing business in New York, his home state. The trial could last into December, Engoron has said.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers had asked the judge to throw out the case, which he denied. They contend that James wasn\u2019t legally allowed to file the lawsuit because there isn\u2019t any evidence that the public was harmed by Trump\u2019s actions. They also argued that many of the allegations in the lawsuit were barred by the statute of limitations.\nEngoron, noting that he had \u201cemphatically rejected\u201d those arguments earlier in the case, equated them to the \u201ctime-loop in the film \u2018Groundhog Day.'\u201d\nJames, a Democrat, sued Trump and the Trump Organization a year ago, alleging a pattern of duplicity that she dubbed \u201cthe art of the steal,\u201d a twist on the title of Trump\u2019s 1987 business memoir \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\nThe lawsuit accused Trump and his company of routinely inflating the value of assets like skyscrapers, golf courses and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, padding his bottom line by billions.\nAmong the allegations were that Trump claimed his Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan \u2014 a three-story penthouse replete with gold-plated fixtures \u2014 was nearly three times its actual size and valued the property at $327 million. No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.\nTrump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million \u2014 more than 10 times a more reasonable estimate of its worth. Trump\u2019s figure for the private club and residence was based on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use, but deed terms prohibit that, James said.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing, arguing in sworn testimony for the case that it didn\u2019t matter what he put on his financial statements because they have a disclaimer that says they shouldn\u2019t be trusted. He told James at the April deposition, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a case and you should drop this case.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know the banks were fully paid? Do you know the banks made a lot of money?\u201d Trump testified. \u201cDo you know I don\u2019t believe I ever got even a default notice, and even during COVID, the banks were all paid? And yet you\u2019re suing on behalf of banks, I guess. It\u2019s crazy. The whole case is crazy.\u201d\nEngoron rejected that argument when the defense previously sought to have the case thrown out.\nThe judge said the disclaimer on the financial statements \u201cmakes abundantly clear that Mr. Trump was fully responsible for the information contained within\u201d them and that \u201callowing blanket disclaimers to insulate liars from liability would completely undercut\u201d the \u201cimportant function\u201d that such statements serve \u201cin the real world.\u201d\nJames\u2019 lawsuit is one of several legal headaches for Trump as he campaigns for a return to the White House in 2024. He has been indicted four times in the last six months \u2014 accused in Georgia and Washington, D.C., of plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss, in Florida of hoarding classified documents, and in Manhattan of falsifying business records related to hush money paid on his behalf.\nThe Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud last year in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. The company was fined $1.6 million. One of the executives, Trump\u2019s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty and served five months in jail. He is a defendant in James\u2019 lawsuit and gave sworn deposition testimony for the case in May.\nJames\u2019 lawsuit does not carry the potential of prison time, but could complicate his ability to transact real estate deals. It could also stain his legacy as a developer.\nJames has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years, among other sanctions. The $250 million in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said.\nJames, who campaigned for office as a Trump critic and watchdog, started scrutinizing his business practices in March 2019 after his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank while trying to obtain financing to buy the NFL\u2019s Buffalo Bills.\nJames\u2019 office previously sued Trump for misusing his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests. Trump was ordered to pay $2 million to an array of charities as a fine and the charity, the Trump Foundation, was shut down.\n\nThis article, authored by Michael R.

{"title":"The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer","context":"## The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer\n\nThousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president\u2019s 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4.5 billion. Bloomberg\u2019s calculation has consistently been below Trump\u2019s figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he\u2019s accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his \u201cbrand\u201d adds. He also said that banks didn\u2019t rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t a very important element in banks\u2019 decision-making process,\u201d Trump told the court. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll explain that as this trial goes along.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at New York state\u2019s valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg\u2019s own approach to assessing the assets.\nMar-a-Lago Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US612.1 million , Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US240 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US27.6 million It\u2019s fair to say that Trump\u2019s most famous property these days is no longer New York\u2019s Trump Tower but his Mar-a-Lago Club, the historic Palm Beach estate built by Marjorie Merriweather Post in the 1920s that he now calls home. New York\u2019s valuation of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate has raised eyebrows. Credit: AP The sprawling resort has been at the centre of some publicised post-presidency scandals, from classified documents being kept in one of its bathrooms to the location where Trump is said to have shared nuclear submarine secrets with Australian businessman Anthony Pratt \u2014 something that Trump denies.\nIt\u2019s also a major focus in Trump\u2019s fraud lawsuit. Trump made a series of agreements with Palm Beach County and the National Trust for Historic Preservation for Mar-a-Lago to be used only as a club, giving up any development rights. Consequently, Palm Beach values the property as a business on its tax rolls. In 2021, the county assessed it at $US27.6 million, lower than comparable residential properties. New York State argues that this appraisal is the one Trump should have been using. New York\u2019s estimated value \u201cwas a shock to the real estate community and anybody with any understanding of the island and its values,\u201d said Liza Pulitzer, a real estate agent at Brown Harris Stevens and a Palm Beach native. \u201cIt could easily fetch $US500 million or more.\u201d\nThat assumes a buyer views it as a single-family residence. It\u2019s currently not zoned for such use, though Trump is able to reside there through a loophole designating himself an employee. Trump\u2019s legal team engaged an expert witness who argued that a future buyer could do the same thing. And if they didn\u2019t like the idea of sharing their property with others, they could reduce the club to a membership of one. Still, it\u2019s unclear if Palm Beach would allow that without a change to its zoning status. Historically, Mar-a-Lago never made much money for the Trump Organisation, but that seems to be changing. It took in about $US41 million in revenue last year, according to Trump\u2019s most recent ethics disclosure, compared with $US21 million in 2019. Bloomberg values Mar-a-Lago at $US240 million, based on a combination of comparable residential property sales in the area as well as its value as a business, reflecting some uncertainty around its future status. That uncertainty isn\u2019t shared by everyone. If the city and county allowed it, \u201cthere is no reason why it wouldn\u2019t be able to converted to a full-time private residence,\u201d said Eli Beracha, director of the Hollo School of Real Estate at Florida International University.\nTrump\u2019s Fifth Avenue penthouse Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US131.3 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US40 million, New York valuation: No current estimate available Trump\u2019s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years, so it\u2019s not surprising that one of the world\u2019s masters of hyperbole exaggerated its size for most of that time. Trump\u2019s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years. Credit: AP Between 2011 and 2016, Trump valued his apartment based on it being 30,000 square feet (2,787 square metres) in size \u2014 almost triple its actual measurement of 10,996 square feet. Because of this, New York State arrived at a valuation that was about a third of Trump\u2019s in those years. They haven\u2019t provided a more recent estimate.\nSpace inflation wasn\u2019t the only issue. Between 2014 and 2015, Trump increased the value of the apartment to $US327 million from $US200 million. The prosecution argues that was to mask a drop in the value of one of his other properties. \u201cA discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,\u201d Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a September ruling. \u2018The company has never been stronger and never been better.\u2019 Eric Trump Bloomberg values the property using recent Trump Tower sales, as well as those of comparable Manhattan penthouses. While some splashy residences in much newer buildings on so-called Billionaires Row have listed for well in excess of $US100 million, they typically boast higher ceilings, more up-to-date finishes, contemporary layouts, outdoor space and better views. A better comparison would be a 9450-square-foot penthouse in Olympic Tower, five blocks south on Fifth Avenue, which has been on and off the market for $US35 million since 2016. Then there\u2019s Carl Icahn\u2019s 14,000-square-foot penthouse at Museum Tower on West 53rd Street. It was listed for $US35 million in 2019 before he attempted to split the space and sell it as two separate apartments. Both were eventually delisted.\nIt\u2019s possible Trump would get a higher price because of his name. \u201cThere would be a Trump premium because the person that would want that property is likely to be a Trump supporter,\u201d Beracha said. But it\u2019s also likely that the association with Trump would turn off some buyers. Trump Park Avenue Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US90.9 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US86.4 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US80 million The residential condo tower on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, formerly the Hotel Delmonico, isn\u2019t one of Trump\u2019s best-known buildings, but it\u2019s been the source of some significant asset inflations, according to the prosecution.\nIts value to Trump mostly stems from unsold condo units that are owned by the Trump Organisation and rented out. A varying number have been rent-stabilised, meaning tenants pay below market rates. Typically, these apartments are valued at a discount because tenants can stay indefinitely, sometimes even passing them on to children. In 2010, 12 rent-stabilised apartments owned by Trump were valued at an average of $US62,500 each in an appraisal provided by a real estate company. The following year, Trump valued them at $US4.1 million each \u2014 more than 65 times greater. Trump has continued to value stabilised apartments in the building at market rates, including in his 2021 statement of financial condition. Rent-stabilised units \u201cwith a positive cash flow are often valued at 15-25 cents a dollar of the open market value, versus single digits for negative cash flow,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser Miller Samuel. Still, Trump\u2019s optimism was shown to be at least partially justified. By 2021, only five of the 12 apartments remained rent stabilised. The prosecution also claims two additional non-stabilised apartments in the building were overvalued because Trump ignored an option his daughter, Ivanka Trump, had to buy them at a price lower than the market value he used.\n40 Wall Street Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US664 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US270 million, New York\u2019s valuation: No current estimate available In valuing his flagship lower Manhattan office tower, Trump consistently ignored more conservative appraisals he\u2019d received from professionals, New York State argues. Trump has been accused of significantly over-valuing his flagship downtown New York property. Credit: Bloomberg For example, 40 Wall Street was appraised by a real estate company at $US200 million in 2011 and $US220 million in 2012. Despite this, Trump valued the property in financial statements at $US524.7 million and $US527.2 million, respectively, for those years.\nBloomberg uses a capitalisation of net income approach in coming up with an estimate. Valuations for commercial offices across the board have taken a hit in the past 18 months amid rising interest rates and a lacklustre corporate leasing market. But 40 Wall Street has its own unique problems. Tenant departures meant occupancy slid to 77 per cent in June, down from 98 per cent in 2015. Its net operating income is only 61 per cent of what was projected by underwriters. Loading \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of leasing velocity down there,\u201d said Albert Sultan, a broker at Kassin Sabbagh Realty. The financial district used to offer a lower cost for tenants, but with Midtown rents declining, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to go downtown.\u201d The property is also subject to a ground lease that resets in 2032 at either 6 per cent of the land value or 85 per cent of its rent in the prior year. Based on current rent, that means the ground lease would jump to $US30 million from about $US2.6 million now.\n\nThis article, authored by Tom Maloney, was published by The Age on 2023-11-07 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":530}
{"title":"M.L.B. Superstar Shohei Ohtani to Sign $700 Million Deal With Dodgers","context":"## M.L.B. Superstar Shohei Ohtani to Sign $700 Million Deal With Dodgers\n\nShohei Ohtani\u2019s singular pursuit of history, one man\u2019s quest to rewrite the baseball world\u2019s understanding of what is possible, reached another summit on Saturday when he agreed to the largest contract in the annals of major North American team sports, a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, his agency CAA announced.\nAdvertisement\nOhtani announced his decision on Instagram. The deal ends years of feverish speculation about Ohtani\u2019s future. Ohtani, a 29-year-old two-way sensation, has captivated the industry since he left Japan for Major League Baseball heading into the 2018 season. He has done things that appeared impossible in the modern era, feats that harkened back to Babe Ruth. As he traveled the country with the Los Angeles Angels this past summer, fans serenaded him with recruiting pitches. When he entered free agency, a dozen teams lined up, curious to see if they could meet his eye.\nOnly one team could secure Ohtani\u2019s services. He will now be compensated for both his immense talent and his unparalleled star power. His contract eclipsed the $360 million record for free agents set last winter by New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge and also surpassed the record-setting $426.5 million extension from Ohtani\u2019s former Angels teammate Mike Trout. His achievement exceeded even those outside of baseball, topping the $450 million contract inked by Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Ohtani has outpaced even soccer star Lionel Messi\u2019s $674 million contract \u2014 signed in 2017 when he was with FC Barcelona.\nHis individual brilliance was not enough to lift the Angels into the postseason. With the Dodgers, Ohtani will now have an opportunity to add collective hardware to his trophy case. The Dodgers have won the National League West in 10 of the past 11 seasons, topped 100 victories in five of the past six full seasons and won the World Series in 2020. Ohtani has never played a postseason game in his big-league career.\n\u201cMy sense is that he wants to be the best ever,\u201d said St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Lars Nootbaar, who played with Ohtani last spring in the World Baseball Classic, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think he would ever publicly say that.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nDeferrals effectively lower the average annual value of Ohtani\u2019s contract, giving the Dodgers greater flexibility as they attempt to navigate Major League Baseball\u2019s luxury-tax system, which includes penalties for teams that exceed certain thresholds.\nA team\u2019s luxury tax-payroll is calculated according to players\u2019 average annual values, and discounted by deferrals. Mookie Betts, for example, has $115 million deferred in his 12-year, $365 million contract with the Dodgers. Under the league\u2019s calculations, the deferrals lower his average annual value from $30.4 million to $25.5 million.\nDodgers officials declined comment when asked if Ohtani had taken a physical, the final step before a deal can become official.\nSignificant questions linger about Ohtani\u2019s future. He will not pitch in 2024 as he recovers from a September operation to repair his right elbow\u2019s ulnar collateral ligament. He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2018. Neither Ohtani, who has not taken questions from reporters since August, nor his agent, Nez Balelo, nor the Angels have disclosed the exact nature of the second surgery, but the Los Angeles Times has reported it was a second Tommy John procedure.\nBalelo has stressed that Ohtani remains committed to both pitching and hitting in the future. \u201cShohei loves to pitch,\u201d Balelo told reporters in September. Ohtani will attempt to return to the mound in 2025. His camp has not revealed at what point Ohtani would consider giving up his dual career and focusing on learning a different position. Since he was a teenager, Ohtani has ignored suggestions that he focus on only one pursuit.\nOhtani demonstrated his potential as the American League Rookie of the Year in 2018, but his two-way hopes were delayed after his first elbow surgery. It was not until 2021 that the full flower of his ability bloomed. He has won the American League MVP in two of the past three seasons; in the intervening season, he led all American League pitchers in strikeout rate while hitting 34 home runs with an .875 OPS. To create a comparison for him involves inventions that sound freakish. \u201cIt\u2019s like if Judge went out and was a 20-game winner as well,\u201d former teammate Kole Calhoun said.\nOhtani will not pitch in 2024 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, but his agent stressed he\u2019s committed to returning to the mound. (Photo: Michael Owens \/ Getty Images)\nOhtani is committed to being a starting pitcher. If he cannot stay healthy enough for that role, he could aid his new team as a reliever. He closed the final game of the World Baseball Classic, securing the crown for Japan by striking out Trout. His four-seam fastball averaged nearly 97 mph in 2023; the velocity of the pitch figures to improve in short bursts.\nAdvertisement\nEven if Ohtani never pitches again, his value as a hitter is immense. In 1920, his first season exclusively as a hitter, Ruth led the American League in homers, on-base percentage and slugging percentage. In 2023, while still making 23 starts with a 3.14 ERA, Ohtani led the American League in the same three categories as Ruth. He swatted 44 homers with a career-best 1.066 OPS. He did this while making starts and dealing with a torn ligament in his elbow.\nOnly one stage remains for Ohtani. He has never played a postseason game in the majors. As the Angels foundered in recent years, Ohtani became more vocal about his desire to play for a winner. Now he has the chance to make a different kind of history.\nRequired reading\n(Photo: Stacy Revere \/ Getty Images)\n\nThis article, authored by The New York Times, was published by The New York Times on 2023-12-09 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":531}
{"title":"India to be one of world's fastest growing economies over next decade","context":"## India to be one of world's fastest growing economies over next decade\n\nThe IMF. in its latest update. has said that India is one of the large emerging economies that has been doing better than expected.\nThe IMF said India has been doing better for a while now and that India is, in fact, one of the growth engines in the world economy at this point.\nThe IMF said important divergences are appearing. The slowdown is more pronounced in advanced economies than in emerging markets and developing economies. Among the advanced economies, the US has been revised up, with resilient consumption and investment, while the euro area has been revised down, as tighter monetary policy and the energy crisis took a toll.\nThere is divergence also among emerging markets and developing economies, with China facing growing headwinds, while Brazil, India. and Russia are revised up.\nAfter two years of rapid economic growth in 2021 and 2022, the near-term economic outlook for India is for continued rapid expansion during 2023-24, underpinned by strong growth in private consumption and investment, S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a recent update.\nThe acceleration of foreign direct investment inflows into India over the past decade reflects the favourable long-term growth outlook for the Indian economy, helped by a youthful demographic profile and rapidly rising urban household incomes.\nIndia's nominal GDP measured in USD terms is forecast to rise from $3.5 trillion in 2022 to $7.3 trillion by 2030. This rapid pace of economic expansion would result in the size of the Indian GDP exceeding the Japanese GDP by 2030, making India the second largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.\nBy 2022, the size of the Indian GDP had already become larger than the GDP of the UK and also France. By 2030, India's GDP is also forecast to surpass Germany, the research said.\nThe long-term outlook for the Indian economy is supported by a number of key growth drivers. An important positive factor for India is its large and fast-growing middle class, which is helping to drive consumer spending.\nThe rapidly growing Indian domestic consumer market as well as its large industrial sector have made India an increasingly important investment destination for a wide range of multinationals in many sectors, including manufacturing, infrastructure and services, the report said.\nThe digital transformation of India that is currently underway is expected to accelerate the growth of e-commerce, changing the retail consumer market landscape over the next decade. This is attracting leading global multinationals in technology and e-commerce to the Indian market.\nBy 2030, 1.1 billion people in India will have internet access, more than doubling from the estimated 500 million internet users in 2020. The rapid growth of e-commerce and the shift to 4G and 5G smartphone technology will boost home-grown unicorns.\nThe large increase in FDI inflows to India that has been evident over the past five years is also continuing with strong momentum evident even during the pandemic years of 2020-2022.\nIndia's strong FDI inflows have been boosted by large inflows of investments from global technology MNCs such as Google and Facebook that are attracted to India's large, fast-growing domestic consumer market, as well as a strong upturn in foreign direct investment inflows from manufacturing firms.\nOverall, India is expected to continue to be one of the world's fastest growing economies over the next decade. This will make India one of the most important long-term growth markets for multinationals in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing industries such as autos, electronics and chemicals to services industries such as banking, insurance, asset management, health care and information technology, it added.\nBrahma Chellaney, professor of strategic studies at the New Delhi-based Center for Policy Research, wrote in a recent article that as India's geopolitical, economic and cultural clout grows, so does its global footprint. China's \u201cdecline,\u201d as some have begun to call the conclusion of the country's four-decade-long economic boom, opens new opportunities for the Indian economy and other developing and emerging countries.\nEarlier this year, India reached another milestone when its population officially surpassed that of China, which had been the world's most populous country for more than 300 years.\nWhile China's shrinking, rapidly aging population is likely to impede economic growth and may curtail its geopolitical ambitions, India -- one of the world's youngest countries, with a median age of 28.2 -- is poised to reap a huge demographic dividend, the article said.\nBut the driving force behind India's emergence as a major global power is its rapid economic growth. While India's gross domestic product is still smaller than China's, the country is currently the world's fastest-growing major economy and is projected to account for 12.9 per cent of global growth over the next five years, surpassing the United States' 11.3 per cent share, the article said.\nThe seventeenth round of the FICCI-IBA survey was carried out for the period January to June 2023. A total of 24 banks including public sector, private sector and foreign banks participated in the survey. These banks together represent about 79 per cent of the banking industry, as classified by asset size.\nThe Indian economy posted an impressive 7.2 per cent growth in the financial year ended March 2023 and 7.8 per cent in first quarter of current fiscal year. Credit growth also continued to rise, signalling robust demand conditions in the Indian economy, as well as banks' improved appetite towards retail borrowers.\nThe health of the banking sector has witnessed an encouraging turnaround, marked by healthier bank balance sheets and gross NPA ratio at a decade low.\nThe survey findings show that long term credit demand has seen continued growth in sectors such as Infrastructure, textiles and chemicals. food processing and metals.\nIron & steel have also witnessed accelerated long-term loan disbursements in the past six months. Infrastructure is witnessing an increase in credit flow with 67 per cent of the respondents indicating an increase in long-term loans as against 57 per cent in the previous round.\nThe survey suggests that the outlook on expectation on growth of non-food industry credit over next six months is optimistic with 42 per cent of the participating banks expecting non-food industry credit growth to be above 12 per cent (as compared to 36 per cent in the previous round).\nRajan Jain, Head, Credit Research, SBI Caps, said in a note that whether the yield curve dynamics mean the US is moving to a structurally higher-rate economy vs. post GFC normal remains a moot question, with important implications for investment demand and system risk.\nThese movements have had a cascading effect on global economies, which have seen routs in their respective bond markets, besides a fresh round of currency depreciation.\nEmerging market economies with large volumes of USD denominated debt are especially vulnerable as they could be caught in a vicious circle of their external debt (in local currency terms) ballooning due to strong DXY and their servicing ability being impaired by tepid economic activity owing to high rates. Even advanced economies have felt the heat, and the ECB etc. have maintained a hawkish narrative, Jain said.\nAnother developing story seems to be the greenshoots of recovery in China backed by domestic consumption in the Golden week, and tourism related to the Asian Games. For now, these seem to buttressed on stimulus and base effects as China is now fully open.\nThe long-term trajectory remains to be seen. In any case, for now this has provided a floor for commodity prices, especially base metals. Fickle commodity prices will also be victims of fresh geopolitical tensions in West Asia, which has pushed up Brent crude. Food prices could also play truant with climate change affecting cropping area worldwide: sugar and rice prices are booming, the note said.\nIn this challenging environment, Indian real GDP growth, estimated to be 6.2 per cent y\/y in real terms in FY24, is resilient. High frequency indicators suggest strong construction and infrastructure activity, and soaring urban demand.\nManufacturing production has been unusually strong in Q2FY24, especially in infrastructure-oriented structures such as cement and steel. Power supply grew vastly in Q2 after a tepid Q1, helped by a dry August 2023 and buzzing industrial activity.\nBoth the Union and States have front ended capex in H1FY24, and this remains the engine of expansion. Capital expenditure was up 48 per cent y\/y for the Union in the same period. Reports suggest capex of major states was also up 45 per cent y\/y in 5MFY24.\nCarrying forward this capex in H2FY24 would be important to sustain the multiplier. The fiscal deficit for the 5MFY24 stood at 36% of the FY24BE. Gross direct tax revenue experienced a substantial increase of 18 per cent y\/y up to October 9, allaying concerns of fiscal slippage, the note said.\n\nThis article, authored by zee business, was published by Zee Business on 2023-10-14 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":532}
{"title":"Diablo 4 season 2\u2019s biggest draw is its quality-of-life updates","context":"## Diablo 4 season 2\u2019s biggest draw is its quality-of-life updates\n\nDiablo 4\u2019s Season of Blood brings some cool new vampire powers into the fold, but the real star of the action game\u2019s second season is its sweeping quality-of-life changes. Players will now have an easier time leveling up, gaining quality loot, and just navigating the open world of Sanctuary.\nGame director Joe Shely and associate game director Joe Piepiora sat down to do a roundtable interview with Polygon and other outlets ahead of Blizzard\u2019s Oct. 4th livestream, and gave additional context to Nightmare Dungeon changes, Renown, and more.\nOne of the most notable changes for players in Diablo 4\u2019s second season update will be an increase in experience gains. Blizzard claims players will be able to reach the level cap of 100 about 40% faster than in Season of the Malignant \u2014 which already increased experience gains compared to Diablo 4\u2019s launch. This process should be much smoother for players as well, as monsters will now match their levels between 55 and 75.\nShely told the panel that last season, players set a goal for themselves: Get to level 100. However, many players found that they were never able to hit that milestone because XP gains were so slow. This change should allow more players to reach the level cap each season, allowing them to play with a truly maxed-out build.\nAs for how players will spend their time at max level and where they\u2019ll be able to earn some of the game\u2019s most powerful items, enter the five new endgame bosses: Grigoire The Galvanic Saint, the Echo of Varshan, The Beast in the Ice, the Dark Master, and the Echo of Duriel. Each boss has its own laundry list of busy work for players to complete in order to unlock their encounter \u2014 such as completing Nightmare Dungeons above level 30 or completing Grim Favors \u2014 but they also come with Unique rewards. That\u2019s Unique with a capital U.\nBecause the bosses each offer their own pool of Unique items, this process makes farming for that special helmet that much easier. Instead of running dungeons and hoping the desired item drops, players can just gather all the materials, kill The Beast in the Ice, and then do it all again if they don\u2019t get what they wanted. The Echo of Duriel is perhaps the most interesting of the five, as Duriel has a chance to drop the ultimate, super-rare, uber Uniques that were previously almost impossible to acquire. To compensate, players will need to kill the four other endgame bosses each time they want to face Duriel.\nBlizzard\u2019s designers didn\u2019t build these bosses to be as tough as the ultimate Uber Lilith fight. However, these bosses will (hopefully) prove a challenge to most players while still giving them a targeted way to farm some must-have items. The Echo of Duriel (who is level 100) will be the most difficult of the new bosses, but the reward will obviously be worth the struggle, considering he\u2019s the only way for players to farm Uber Uniques in Diablo 4. For players who have more in-game gold than time, Blizzard also confirmed in our interview that players will be able to trade with one another to get the items needed to summon Duriel and the other bosses.\nWhile these bosses are a form of milestone activity for players, Nightmare Dungeons will still exist as places to both farm for better items and push builds to their limit. However, the dungeons are becoming much simpler and less grindy. The design team has reworked several Nightmare Dungeon affixes to make them less obnoxious, and Nightmare Sigils now teleport players directly into the dungeon instead of to the door.\nTeleporting to Nightmare Dungeons is one thing, but players will still need to ride their horses around the world if they want to reach events like Helltides and the new seasonal activity, Blood Harvest. Thankfully, mounts have also been improved in season 2. Horses are now faster, and their dashes will allow them to break through barricades in the roads. Shely told us that the mounts should be more intelligent as well, and they won\u2019t get stuck on objects in the world as easily as before.\nTwo of the other biggest pain points \u2014 gems and Renown \u2014 are also getting addressed in this season.\nThe grind to accrue Renown \u2014 the resource players get for completing activities in each area \u2014 is no longer something players will need to partake in every season. Much like the Altars of Lilith change in season 1, players who\u2019ve fully unlocked their Renown track with one character will never have to do it again.\nPreviously, players would have to max out their Renown \u2014 which all but required doing nearly every dungeon and most side quests in the game \u2014 every season in order to get all available Skill and Paragon Points. Not only is that not the case anymore, but (unlike with the Altars of Lilith carryover) you won\u2019t need to first log into a character that\u2019s completed the Renown track in order to propagate that data to the rest of your account. Piepiora told us that all of that data migration should happen without that extra step in season 2.\nThis is yet another massive 180 on the Renown system from Blizzard in barely five months\u2019 time. When we asked about the massive shift, Piepiora told us that players simply weren\u2019t having fun redoing the grind every season, hence the move here (as with the Altars last season) to alleviate the pressure on players to only play \u201cefficiently.\u201d\nAs for gems, these items will no longer take up bag space, as they\u2019re now considered crafting materials. This change comes alongside a massive upgrade to the Stash itself. Stashes now appear in more locations \u2014 including all minor towns with a Waypoint in them \u2014 and players can search their Stashes for specific items and affixes.\nThese are just a handful of the major changes coming to Diablo 4 with Season of Blood. Shely and Piepiora told us that the focus on quality-of-life upgrades was largely due to season 2 being the first season where they and the rest of the Diablo 4 team could really listen to feedback. Because of how close Season of the Malignant launched after the release of Diablo 4 (just over a month), that season\u2019s content was largely finished before players had really gotten to dive into the action-RPG. However, with season 2, Blizzard has been able to react more to player feedback and finally create some sweeping, specific changes that players have been requesting.\nAll of these changes, as well as the content for Season of Blood, will come to the game on Oct. 17, just a few weeks before fans are expecting Blizzard to announce Diablo 4\u2019s first expansion at BlizzCon 2023.\n\nThis article, authored by Ryan Gilliam, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-04 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":533}

Yet that was all Argentina would get, and while it was enough for a 1-0 victory, they could have had many, many more.\nLionel Messi came off the bench shortly after halftime, but even he was powerless to change the narrative, hitting the post twice including once directly off a corner.\nLautaro Martinez, Rodrigo de Paul, and Nico Gonzalez were all very active in the final third and had multiple chances, but none were able to find the all-important second goal to kill off the match. Yet in the end, Emiliano Martinez had himself another clean sheet as Paraguay failed to produce more than a single quality attacking chance.\nThe shutout gave Dibu an Argentine national team record, passing 609 minutes without conceding a goal, as Argentina have not been breached since Kylian Mbappe's dramatic 118th minute equalizer in the 2022 World Cup final. Additionally, Lionel Scaloni has still never been beaten in World Cup qualifying as Argentina head coach.\nThe Sporting News followed the Argentina vs. Paraguay match live, providing score updates, commentary and highlights as they happened.\nMORE: Where to watch Argentina vs. Paraguay in World Cup qualifying\nArgentina vs Paraguay final score\nScore Goal scorers Argentina 1 Otamendi (4') Paraguay 0 \u2014\nKickoff: 8 p.m. local (7 p.m. ET \/ 4 p.m. PT)\nLocation: Estadio Monumental (Buenos Aires, Argentina)\nReferee: Raphael Claus (BRA)\nStarting lineups:\nArgentina (4-3-3, right to left): 23.

The entire team was impressive until it came time to shoot, and even Lionel Messi couldn't change the narrative as he hit the post twice.\nAll told thought, Nicolas Otamendi's early goal was enough to see them through to all three points, as they top Paraguay at home and move to nine points from a possible nine to start World Cup qualifying.\n\ud83c\udfc6 #Eliminatorias \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Rodrigo De Paul: \"Creo que estamos en un nivel muy bueno.

Argentina have a very dangerous free-kick as Lionel Messi baits Gustavo Gomez into a foul just atop the penalty area in a central location. Gomez does well to dispossess Messi, but the Argentine is first back on the loose ball, expertly shielding the ball with his body, and Gomez obliges by barging in from behind.\nWith the set-piece, Messi hits the woodwork! Carlos Coronel is helpless to do anything but watch, rooted to the spot, and he sees it sail by him and strike the outside of the left post!\nGio Lo Celso comes on for Argentina to replace Rodrigo de Paul, who had a very good match.\n89th min: As this game sputters towards a conclusion, Emiliano Martinez has set a new national team record for a shutout streak, crossing 609 minutes of play without conceding a goal. It's an impressive mark nonetheless, but in fairness, he's had almost nothing to do tonight, making just one (admittedly impressive) save.\nArgentina have not conceded a single goal since the 2022 World Cup final.

Paraguay fail to clear on a number of occasions, and on recycle, Lautaro Martinez fires just inches over the crossbar! He's in acres of space atop the penalty area shaded just right of the middle, and cutting onto his left, he rifles a shot just high! He should be hitting the target from there with so much space to shoot.\nThat's the first real chance on goal from open play for either team in some time. The game has been mucked up a bit by the substitutions on both sides.\n77th min: Chance, Argentina! LIONEL MESSI HITS THE POST DIRECTLY FROM A CORNER!

At first it seems like a cramp as a teammate stretches out his leg, but he continues to grimace in pain, and after the medical staff tends to the Paraguay defender for a bit, they signal to the bench that a change is required.\nAlonso is strapped to a stretcher and continues to grimace in lots of pain. On comes Mathias Villasanti, signaling a potential change of formation.\n70th min: Junior Alonso has got to be careful. Already on a yellow card, he fouls Lautaro Martinez hard and gets a talking too from the referee.\nParaguay make their second change of the match, a double swap as Antonio Sanabria and Braian Ojeda come on, replacing Antonio Bareiro and Alvaro Campuzano.\n68th min: Rodrigo de Paul forces a save from Carlos Coronel! It's from an extremely tight angle on the right, almost on top of the end line, so Coronel has his post covered well, but it wins a corner. The set-piece is wasted by being played short.\n63rd min: It has to be said...Argentina have dropped their level since Lionel Messi has come on. That's not to say its explicitly his fault, but the whole team has been sloppy since he entered the pitch. Paraguay have looked a bit more confident pressing the hosts, and it has caused some problems to them in possession.\n57th min: Uh, how has Ramon Sosa got away without a booking here? He barges into Rodrigo de Paul extremely late for no reason, as he arrived well after the ball and threw his body into the Argentine midfielder. The referee has a chat with Sosa, but decides not to book him, somehow.\n53rd min: Chance, Paraguay! The best attacking move of the match for the visitors nearly sees Ramon Sosa score a dramatic equalizer, but Emiliano Martinez makes a fingertips save to see the ball deflect just inches wide! It comes on a Route One move deep for Sosa who brings the ball down well and fires a vicious shot.\nLionel Messi enters for Julian Alvarez, and takes the captain's armband from Nicolas Otamendi with a chuckle, as Otamendi puts it on Messi himself despite Messi telling him not to give it up.\nIt's kind of odd that Lionel Scaloni would turn down the chance to bring Messi on at halftime without burning a substitution window, only to see him enter only eight minutes later, but here we are.\nEL REY A LA CANCHA \ud83d\udd1f\u2705\n\nLionel Messi ingres\u00f3 por Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez a los 52 minutos en Argentina vs. Paraguay.\n\n\u00bfMarcar\u00e1 alg\u00fan gol? pic.twitter.com\/Fj7Dqcsfps \u2014 TNT Sports Argentina (@TNTSportsAR) October 13, 2023\n50th min: Antonio Bareiro picks up a hilarious yellow card after a coming together with Cristiano Romero. Bareiro fouls Romero and gets away with it, and Romero reacts later off the ball by bumping the Paraguay forward, who throws himself dramatically to the turf. It's the reaction which earns the booking, while Romero is lucky to get away with his brainless moment.\nKickoff: They've begun the second half, and while Lionel Messi has not entered the pitch yet, he's warming up on the touchline and likely to come on soon. Alexis Mac Allister is fouled from behind just seconds after the restart.\nRobert Rojas has come on for Paraguay in the first substitution of the match, entering at right-back for Ivan Ramirez.\nHALFTIME: Argentina 1-0 Paraguay\nSomehow, some way, Nicolas Otamendi's fourth-minute goal remains the only successful strike of this game so far. Argentina completely and utterly dominated the first 45 minutes, but have precious little to show for it.\nThe hosts pummeled Carlos Coronel's net, and while the Red Bulls goalkeeper has made a few saves, it's mostly been Argentina's wastefulness that has seen them fail to follow up their early opener. Rodrigo de Paul hit the post, Alexis Mac Allister probably should have had a penalty, and Nico Gonzalez has missed a few great chances from the left.\nOverall, Lionel Scaloni will be pleased with his side's performance, but the match hangs in the balance on the scoresheet. In reality, thought, Paraguay need vast improvement if they are to snatch a result after being meticulously carved to pieces.\n1 - Argentina \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 super\u00f3 a Paraguay \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddfe en el primer tiempo en posesi\u00f3n (74% a 26%), remates totales (10 a 2), remates al arco (4 a 0), toques en \u00e1rea rival (17 a 1) y pases acertados (354 a 101).

The hosts break down the right, and Enzo Fernandez has acres of space to shoot at the top of the penalty area, but instead squares it left to Nico Gonzalez. The Argentina winger also has tons of room to shoot, but he's at a tight angle, and Carlos Coronel's positioning leaves him with a very small window to aim for.\nNeeding a precise finish, Gonzalez comes up empty, dragging it wide across the face of goal. It's not far off, but it's missing the required precision! How have Argentina not scored a second????\n42nd min: Chance, Argentina! RODRIGO DE PAUL HITS THE POST! It's SO close from the Argentine midfielder, who's been very active in the final third! After cutting onto his left, he brings it back onto his right and unleashes a curler which dances past a diving Carlos Coronel and strikes the inside of the post!\nThe ball agonizingly careens along the face of goal and skitters away. Just another half-inch more towards the frame and it would have deflected in instead of out!\n41st min: Paraguay are getting extremely frustrated with their lack of attacking possession. They get into the final third for the first time in ages, but with no support, Antonio Bareiro blasts a hopeless effort from a long way out, the shot blocked by his defender who's all over the lone Paraguay striker like white on rice.\n38th min: Chance, Argentina! A deep delivery from way out on the right touchline meets the head of a leaping Nico Gonzalez at the far post, but it's saved well by Carlos Coronel! The header was from a very tight angle, but the Red Bulls goalkeeper still had work to do as he reacted quickly to stick out his left foot and make the reflex stop.\n36th min: Chance, Argentina! The referee very dramatically waves away a penalty shout from Alexis Mac Allister! A corner is cleared to the Liverpool midfielder at the top of the penalty area, and he does brilliantly to dribble through multiple defenders. Before he can get a shot off, he's bumped to the ground, and replay shows he has a clear grievance with the no-call! VAR does not intervene.\nALEXIS MAC ALLISTER, STOP THAT.pic.twitter.com\/wlShqa6mqR \u2014 Roy Nemer (@RoyNemer) October 12, 2023\n34th min: Alvaro Campuzano is whistled for a foul after hip checking Nicolas Tagliafico to the ground, handing Argentina a dangerous free-kick just inside the attacking third. The call by the official sends both Campuzano and Paraguay manager Daniel Garnero into a frenzy, as neither agree with the decision, but it's the right call for overly aggressive body positioning.\nThe chance is wasted, however, as it is easily cleared and Argentina must reset.\n30th min: Chance, Argentina! Lautaro Martinez has a vicious shot agonizingly deflected wide! He's played in on a cutback from Julian Alvarez down the right, and while the Inter striker has a quality hit from the penalty spot, it just clips a defender and loops inches over the crossbar! That's unlucky!\nArgentina are absolutely pummeling the Paraguay back line with silky move after silky move, and the visitors are barely surviving. It's been an onslaught through the first half-hour, especially across the last 10 minutes or so. The one-touch passing through midfield has been essentially unplayable, and on the rare occasion they do lose the ball, they've won it right back within five seconds.\nArgentina are playing champagne football. \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 pic.twitter.com\/y2u5IqqUPy \u2014 Roy Nemer (@RoyNemer) October 12, 2023\n25th min: Julian Alvarez has a shot saved from a very tight angle by Carlos Coronel, conceding a corner. The chance was threaded in beautifully by his strike partner Lautaro Martinez. The set-piece is looped well off target by the head of Cristian Romero.\n21st min: The first yellow card of the game is shown to Junior Alonso who comes flying into a challenge with Alexis Mac Allister and catches him high on the ankle. A very bad tackle \u2014 not quite worthy of a red, but it's not far off either.\n16th min: Ouch, Lautaro Martinez tries to latch onto a wonderful vertical flick from Enzo Fernandez up the gut, but he's just a split-second too late, and he goes sliding into the ribs of Paraguay goalkeeper Carlos Coronel. That looked painful for the Red Bulls goalie, but he's ok to continue.\nIt's a bit surprising that Lautaro got away with no booking from that really dangerous decision.\n13th min: Chance, Argentina! Oh no, it's a terribly bad miss from Nico Gonzalez. The Argentine winger breaks down the left, and with the Paraguay defense lagging behind, he's got plenty of room to shoot across the face of goal from a somewhat tight angle.\nThe \"shot\" is so bad it's hard to tell if he was trying to put it on frame or square it for a teammate at the back post, but it's a tragic attempt either way, as there was nobody anywhere close at the far stick to meet it.\n9th min: Paraguay get their first attacking move playing long to the striker, but after a few nervy moments the Argentina defense recovers and gets back on the ball.\n4th min: GOAL! ARGENTINA! IT'S A GOLAZO FROM THE CAPTAIN NICOLAS OTAMENDI!\nThe first corner of the match goes to Argentina, and as Rodrigo de Paul floats it deep and over the pack, it comes to the Argentina defender who produces an absolutely STUNNING whipped volley, and strikes the ball cleanly by chopping his leg down on the bouncing ball, blasting it through the trees and into the back of the net!\n#ARG 1-0 #PAR | 03\u2019 PT | \u00a1GRITALO NICO!

Messi had missed the previous four matches but returned to the field for the final 30 minutes. He was powerless to turn the tide of the game, after Inter Miami had missed so many gilt-edged chances in the first half.\nHad Inter Miami been still in the playoff hunt, with a potential postseason run on the horizon, Argentina might have played it a bit safer with Messi in this international window. Yet now that his long offseason break is confirmed, Messi may be more aggressive with his minutes here knowing that, after Inter Miami's final two meaningless regular-season matches, he will only have international breaks to keep him sharp until February.\nAccording to a report earlier today, Messi will not start tonight, but is likely to play much or all of the second half, while Lautaro Martinez and Julian Alvarez both start a national team match for the first time. World Cup hero Mario Kempes is a big fan of that.\n\"No deber\u00edamos entrar en la pol\u00e9mica, como pas\u00f3 con Batistuta y Crespo.

Lisandro Martinez is also unavailable after having to undergo another foot operation.\nNow that Inter Miami's playoff run is officially over, Argentina can feel a little better about deploying Lionel Messi at full 90-minute use despite his recent fitness issues, knowing his club season is nearly over and he'll have months of rest upcoming. Messi missed the last match against Bolivia, and missed four Inter Miami games after, but he returned for a half-hour of action in their final fixture before the international break. However, he doesn't start, but is reportedly fit enough to come off the bench for most or all of the second half.\nNicolas Tagliafico started both matches in September, and while Marcos Acuna is back with the team following an injury, the former retains his starting spot. Messi's club teammate Facundo Farias was also included on the roster but it'd be surprising if he saw the field.\nArgentina starting lineup (4-3-3): E.

Players need game time to build their bodies to the point where they can play full 90-minute matches, especially when they are contesting multiple games a week.\nInter Miami's preseason will be watched with extra observation as Messi draws considerable attention wherever he goes, home or abroad. The Argentina star had looked like being part of a tour of China, although that's no longer the case, while the prospect of facing a familiar side from home is a tantalising one.\nThe Sporting News has compiled all the known preseason matches either confirmed or reported prior to the start of Inter Miami's 2024 season.\nMORE: Read all the details regarding Inter Miami vs Al Nassr featuring Messi vs Ronaldo\nInter Miami friendly matches for 2024 preseason\nBelow are all the known fixtures that have either been confirmed by the club directly or widely reported by media.\nIt was anticipated that Inter Miami would embark on a two-match tour of China, but that has now been cancelled, with the trip proving too difficult logistically to arrange. It was replaced by a friendly against fellow MLS side NYCFC to honor Lionel Messi's Ballon d'Or.\nThe biggest confirmed match is the meeting between Messi and rival Cristiano Ronaldo as Inter Miami announced a pair of fixtures in Saudi Arabia, including against Ronaldo's Al Nassr on February 1.\nMORE: When does Inter Miami's 2024 season begin?

Three days prior, Inter Miami will also meet fellow Saudi club Al Hilal.\nMessi and Ronaldo have squared off 35 times across their careers, with Messi winning 16 times to Ronaldo's 10, plus nine draws.

The match will be played on February 4 at Hong Kong Stadium, which seats approximately 40,000 fans, while the club will hold an open training session the day prior. Tickets go on sale December 15 on ticket exchange site Klook.\nWhile the match is the only one in Asia confirmed as of yet, Inter Miami's reference of the trip as a \"tour of Asia\" suggests more matches could be announced in due time. It's notable that Inter Miami will indeed travel to Asia after their attempts to play matches in China back in November fell through.\n\"We're very excited to be visiting Hong Kong and indeed Asia for the very first time,\" explained Jorge Mas, Inter Miami CF Managing Owner. \"From the very beginning we set out to be a global club at Inter Miami. This is a wonderful opportunity to do just that; we hope to enthuse and inspire new Inter Miami fans in Hong Kong and across Asia who share our passion for f\u00fatbol.\"\n\u201cHong Kong is a beautiful city with a great sports scene,\u201d added Inter Miami CF Co-Owner, David Beckham. \u201cThroughout my career, I have spent a lot of time in Asia - I am so pleased to have the opportunity to bring Inter Miami to play our first international tour match in this fantastic city.\u201d\nVissel Kobe to face Inter Miami in Tokyo\nFollowing the match with Hong Kong, Inter Miami will head to Tokyo to take on J1 League champions Vissel Kobe.\nThe game will take place at the Japan National Stadium and feature a very special guest: Andres Iniesta.\nSpain's World Cup-winning midfielder spent five years with Vissel Kobe after spending his entire club career until that point with Barcelona, where he played alongside Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba during an era of astonishing success in Catalonia.\n\"Vissel Kobe is a powerhouse club in Asia coming off of a historic season after winning the J1 League, so we're thrilled about this opportunity to sharpen our team in a match like this one. We continue to look for the best ways to prepare for 2024, and feel confident this match and this tour will help us do that,\" said Chief Soccer Officer and Sporting Director Chris Henderson.\nBoyhood Messi club to face Inter Miami in USA\nAfter their Asia trip, Inter Miami will host a friendly at DRV PNK Stadium against Newell's Old Boys.\nThe team from Argentina hold a special place in the heart of Messi and Martino. Not only are both men from the city of Rosario, where Newell's are based, but Messi developed at the club's youth academy and Martino played more than 400 senior games for the club before becoming head coach in 2012.\n\"I am delighted to welcome my beloved Newell's to our home here in Miami. It will be a special match due to everything Newell's Old Boys means to me,\" said the Inter Miami coach. \"It will also be a good opportunity to prepare for what will surely be an exciting season.\"\nMessi signed for Barcelona after spending six years as a youth player at Newell's, during which time he reportedly scored 234 goals.\nWill Inter Miami face River Plate in Dallas?\nIn late November, it was reported that Inter Miami have arranged to contest a friendly against Argentine giants River Plate in Dallas, Texas in late January.\nAccording to Argentine journalist German Balcarce of River Plate publication RMG, the match will take place on January 20 and will be played at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys. However, with the El Salvador friendly, which is confirmed by the club, happening literally the day before in El Salvador, it would be impossible for Inter Miami to play this match as reported unless they split the squad.\nThe match would supposedly be the second leg of a two-part trip for River Plate, who will also meet Liga MX club Deportivo Guadalajara (formerly Chivas) on January 17 at the same venue. This will be updated with any additional information on whether this match will be moved to another day or nixed entirely.\nInter Miami play NYCFC in Noche d'Or to replace China trip\nWith the club's elimination from 2023 MLS playoff contention, Lionel Messi is facing nearly a full month off from competitive fixtures before he takes the field for Argentina against Uruguay and Brazil in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.\nLikely with the sole intent of keeping Messi fit in that time off, and the added bonus of raking in significant cash, Inter Miami scheduled a two-match tour of China in early November after their regular season concluded.\nThey were expected to visit two Chinese Super League sides, starting with a match against Qingdao Hainiu on November 5, followed by a game against Chengdu Rongcheng three days later However, it was reported on October 30 the planned tour was off.

{"title":"The inside story of Dave Clark's tumultuous last days at Flexport","context":"## The inside story of Dave Clark's tumultuous last days at Flexport\n\nIn this article SHOP-CA\nUPS\nFDX\nAMZN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nDave Clark (L) and Ryan Petersen (R) Getty Images\nOn Sept. 13, Flexport founder Ryan Petersen took the stage at North America's premier supply chain conference in Phoenix. It was exactly a week after he'd forced out his hand-picked successor as CEO, ex-Amazon executive Dave Clark, so Petersen could once again run the show. Sitting in the first few rows of attendees was Clark, the man he'd ousted just a year into the job. Petersen was surprised that he showed up, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Days earlier, Petersen had excoriated Clark, alleging he'd secretly expanded the company's headcount and taken on unnecessary leases without Petersen or the board's knowledge. On X, formerly known as Twitter, Petersen wrote, \"Strategic Plan, Day 1: Make better decisions!\" With Clark sitting a few feet away, Petersen struck a different tone. \"I think we're going to look back and go, 'Wow I'd probably do that all over again because of the progress that we've made,'\" Petersen said, in an interview on stage. Doing it over again would seem to suggest hiring Clark wasn't a bad decision. Petersen went even further, personally commending Clark for orchestrating the $1.3 billion purchase of Deliverr from Shopify , picking up supply chain technology for last-mile deliveries. That deal was announced in May. \"I'm very, very lucky because I wouldn't have had the courage to go and do that acquisition, but I give all the credit in the world to Dave Clark,\" Petersen said. \"There's no one probably in the world who would be better at running that last-mile e-com fulfillment network. Personally, I don't have any experience and I would've been pretty intimidated to try and go pull that off.\" The mixed messaging from the 43-year-old Flexport founder underscores the dysfunction surrounding the sudden firing of Clark, who previously spent 23 years at Amazon and built its mammoth logistics network on the way to becoming one of Jeff Bezos' top deputies. It's also indicative of a bigger challenge facing Flexport, whose software is designed to simplify the process of transporting goods. The company was valued at $8 billion by private investors in early 2022, just as the economy was turning and the 10-year tech bull market was coming to an end. As a high-valued company backed by powerful VCs, Flexport has been trying to simultaneously operate in Silicon Valley startup growth mode while also restraining expenses to reflect the new economic realities and to cope with supply chain bottlenecks. This account is based on conversations with people close to Clark and Petersen. They requested anonymity to discuss confidential interactions. Their perspectives have been corroborated by internal documents and communications reviewed by CNBC. Petersen has publicly said Clark overspent, overhired and overpromised, something his allies echoed to CNBC. He burned through cash and kept Petersen in the dark about key financials and an ambitious expansion into providing end-to-end supply chain tools for small and medium-sized businesses. People close to Petersen pointed to a number of previously unreported incidents that eroded his confidence in Clark. But documents viewed by CNBC and sources close to Clark undermine those claims. They show that Clark, who arrived when the company was struggling to bill customers and track containers, worked closely with the board and Petersen to implement decisions that Flexport now suggests were ill-advised. Evidence to support Flexport's claims of financial mismanagement is lacking, raising questions about whether that narrative was put forward to justify Clark's exit. A Flexport spokesperson rejected that characterization. \"Ryan Petersen returned as CEO in order to restore Flexport's culture of customer engagement, and drive the growth and cost discipline required to return the company to profitability,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\nGet IPO ready\nClark arrived last year as the perfect hire for a tech startup trying to disrupt the age-old logistics industry. He'd built Amazon's logistics unit into a juggernaut that rivaled carriers like UPS and FedEx .\nRyan Petersen, chief executive officer of Flexport, participates in a panel discussion during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nSince 2021, Petersen had been seeking a successor for Flexport's then-operating chief, Sanne Manders, in part to address what several ex-employees described as lingering issues with the company's troubled billing processes. Fixing that was Clark's job. Petersen and Clark worked together as co-CEOs for the first six months. In March, Petersen transitioned to executive chairman. The co-CEO arrangement would free Petersen up to do what he loved \u2013 \"getting beers with customers,\" in the words of two former Flexport employees. Clark, a self-described \"builder at heart,\" was at the wheel. Among Clark's goals was to help Petersen prepare Flexport for an IPO, something the company had discussed doing within a two- to three-year window, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents viewed by CNBC. \"There's a perfect complement of skill sets,\" Petersen told Forbes in June 2022. \"Mine are much more creative, zero-to-one founder time, and Dave is the supreme executor and a legend in the supply chain world.\" Buying Deliverr was meant to be the first step in turning Flexport into a more full-scale logistics service for its customers. Shopify had acquired Deliverr in May 2022 for $2.1 billion. But the e-commerce software company was getting hammered by Wall Street as its Covid pandemic pop faded. By January 2023, CEO Tobias Lutke knew he needed to get rid of Deliverr. Around that time, Lutke first approached Petersen to float the possibility of a deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Petersen told Clark he should engage with Shopify's team, according to a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations. Initial talks fell apart, but resumed when Flexport executives learned that Shopify was about to execute deep cost cuts and was eager to sell Deliverr. Clark and Petersen flew to Miami to meet with Shopify's leadership. As a transaction was nearing, Clark, who had a reputation as a deft negotiator, got Shopify, which was already an investor in Flexport, to sweeten it with $40 million in cash and the framework for a $260 million convertible note that could help Flexport on its path to an IPO, according to an internal document analyzing the deal. The sale would be announced alongside Shopify's first-quarter earnings report on May 4. \"We did not change the terms of a deal or rush it just to have it line up with an earnings call,\" Shopify said in a statement. With Flexport, \"we are tightly mission-aligned to ensure the success of our merchants, which is why we chose to deepen our partnership with them earlier this year.\" The night before the announcement, Petersen appeared at a \"Tech Talk\" at Flexport's Bellevue, Washington, office to pitch the \"Flexport vision\" to hundreds of people. An attendee asked Petersen whether Flexport would ever get into last-mile logistics. Petersen paused, glanced at his watch, and said to keep an eye on the morning news, according to a Flexport employee who witnessed the exchange and by a person who was told independently. The comment alarmed Clark and Flexport executives, who were concerned that Petersen had disclosed material nonpublic information about a publicly traded company, according to people familiar with the matter. Petersen didn't respond to calls or messages from CNBC, and the company declined to make him available for an interview. A Flexport spokesperson didn't respond to CNBC's question about whether Petersen was aware of concerns about his statement at the event.\nThe 'whistleblower'\nClark's first quarterly board meeting as sole CEO was June 1. His second was Aug. 31, days before he was forced out. The board was made up largely of investors who were betting on the founder. It included Founders Fund's Trae Stephens, who had helped start defense-tech firm Anduril Industries, and Michael Ronen, who left SoftBank in 2020. Andreessen Horowitz was represented by Bob Swan, an operating partner at the firm and former CEO of Intel .\nBob Swan, then-interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Intel Corp., reacts during the inauguration of the company's research and development facility in Bengaluru, India, on November 15, 2018. Samyukta Lakshmi | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nFor much of the summer, Clark had pushed then-CFO Kenny Wagers and his financial planning and analysis team to realign Flexport's year-end and 18-month forecasts, according to a person close to the situation. The reasons were obvious. At the beginning of 2022, it cost around $14,500 to move a single container across the Pacific. By late 2022, prices of ocean freight from Asia to the U.S. West Coast were down 90% from a year earlier, due largely to weakening global demand. Because Flexport makes money by charging fees for the transportation of goods, the company's business was getting hammered. But Wagers and Stuart Leung, a Flexport finance executive and a close Petersen ally, were reluctant to pare back forecasts, frustrating Clark, who felt those projections were overly optimistic. Wagers and Leung did not respond to CNBC's interview requests. Clark ultimately prevailed, but the revised forecasts distressed Petersen. Clark, Petersen and Wagers met in Texas in mid-August to fine-tune the forecasts. A source close to Petersen told CNBC that the meeting went poorly for Clark because a so-called whistleblower \u2014 identified as a senior finance executive \u2014 stepped forward shortly before it began and told Petersen that the numbers being presented were \"not real.\" The source referred to the senior finance executive as a whistleblower because of the information he disclosed to Petersen about Clark. Documents seen by CNBC and conversations with people with direct knowledge of the board meeting make it clear that there were no substantiated whistleblower actions or allegations of financial impropriety. Flexport's spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"There was no whistleblower nor was there any financial misconduct. Any allegations to the contrary are completely false.\" On Sept. 15, shortly after CNBC spoke with the Petersen source, legal counsel for Clark sent a cease-and-desist letter to Flexport. The letter, viewed by CNBC, instructed the company to preserve and retain all communications involving Clark's departure. The letter disputes the existence of a whistleblower and lists specific allegations as false and defamatory, including Petersen's claims that Clark was an unfit CEO because he overextended the company's lease obligations. Five hours after the letter was sent, the source close to Petersen contacted CNBC and asked to retract their statements and all details related to Clark's firing or about the so-called whistleblower. CNBC declined to retract his statements. Petersen has since deleted several of his posts criticizing Clark.\nDave Clark, Amazon's former senior vice president of worldwide operations. Lindsey Wasson | Reuters\nThe letter cited two documents that had been presented to the board. Both were viewed by CNBC. The first was a pre-acquisition financial analysis of the Deliverr deal, and the second was a review of Flexport's first-quarter numbers. The Deliverr analysis was presented by the co-CEOs to the board for their approval and was shaped by multiple prior board meetings. Clark's camp suggested that other factors may have led to the abrupt firing. For example, politics. Days after Clark was ousted, Petersen sent him a message \u2014 seen by CNBC \u2014 blasting one of his key female executives for wasting her days at the company on \"far left-wing political activism.\" The executive is a registered Republican. Stephens, the Founders Fund partner, also shared his contempt for that executive weeks before Clark's departure, a person familiar with the board told CNBC. Stephens did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Petersen is also a venture partner at Founders Fund, the firm started by Peter Thiel, who was a prominent supporter of President Trump's 2016 campaign and more recently bankrolled Senate candidates in Ohio and Arizona. Many of Thiel's closest confidantes at Founders Fund and elsewhere in the venture industry are outspoken conservatives. Petersen's sole public political contribution in 2023 was to a Democratic political action committee associated with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. He doesn't talk much about politics on social media or in interviews. Clark has donated to candidates on both sides of the aisle. Upon his departure, The Wall Street Journal reported that he was considering running for governor of Texas, but two people familiar with his thinking say it's not happening anytime soon. Flexport told CNBC that an employee's politics are not relevant in personnel decisions. \"Ryan Petersen does not care at all about anyone's political or personal affiliations. That is their business,\" the spokesperson said. \"It is inappropriate for any employee to spend an excessive amount of time during work hours on activities unrelated to their role.\" A person familiar with the female executive said her noncorporate endeavors were largely related to charitable organizations. Clark has largely remained silent since he was forced to resign on Sept. 5, though in private he's expressed frustration at how his former team was being treated by Flexport, according to people close to him. Many of his allies at Amazon who joined him at Flexport were summarily fired by Petersen shortly after his departure. On Sept. 13, Flexport's chief legal counsel, Chris Ferro, contacted Clark. Ferro told him that his resignation a week prior had not been accepted, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Instead, Ferro told Clark that Flexport's board met the day after Clark resigned and voted to fire him for cause, the person familiar said. Ferro said the board minutes didn't yet reflect why Clark had been fired, the person said. Ferro allegedly told Clark that Flexport would be willing to give him a block of 2 million shares \u2014 worth millions of dollars \u2014 if he signed a separation agreement that included nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses. Clark declined, the person said. Shortly after Flexport reached out with the offer, Clark took the stage at the same supply chain conference in Phoenix that Petersen spoke at earlier in the day. He didn't hold back. \"The only thing I really regret from the past year was I sort of picked the wrong founder,\" Clark said. \"Basically, it was a place of extending my reputational halo to a group that, in my opinion, didn't deserve it. Largely, because about half the team was let go last week on Friday, the most brutal nonseverance packages I've ever seen in my life. It was about as disrespectful a way as humanly possible.\"\nAmazon showdown\nOn top of the public relations fallout from the Clark saga and any legal wrangling that may follow, Flexport faces staffing turnover and a growing threat from Clark's former employer. Flexport recently ousted Wagers as CFO and lost its human resources chief. More layoffs are expected soon, sources said, after the company cut 20% of its staff in January. On Sept. 12, almost a week after Clark was fired, Flexport executives convened in Seattle to launch an end-to-end supply chain service that would allow sellers to move their products from factories to customers' doorsteps through integrations with major online marketplaces. The project was spearheaded by Parisa Sadrzadeh, an executive vice president at Flexport who Clark had poached from Amazon's logistics unit. Earlier in the day, and just up the street from Flexport's event, Amazon had unveiled a strikingly similar service in front of approximately 2,200 attendees at its annual Accelerate seller conference. Flexport had planned to have a booth onsite but was told it couldn't be an exhibitor, which some staffers suspected was due to the competing supply chain products, according to a person familiar with the matter. Flexport discussed securing exhibit space at Accelerate months earlier but didn't meet all the requirements to participate, and its launch wasn't mentioned in those conversations, Amazon said. Flexport's event was underwhelming. In a conference room, about 50 people looked on as Sadrzadeh debuted Flexport's service and then introduced Petersen, who spoke for roughly 20 minutes, according to Burak Yolga, co-founder of a digital freight forwarding company who was in attendance. \"Flexport announced pretty much the same thing that Amazon announced,\" Yolga said in an interview. He said he left after about a half-hour. The company paid rapper Nelly $150,000 to perform at the event. But in the days leading up to the launch, Petersen opted to squash the performance because the optics were bad after his post about rescinding job offers, a person familiar with the matter said. Despite canceling the event, Flexport still paid the artist.

In that meeting, which came the day after the DMV suspended Cruise\u2019s permit, Vogt and other leaders told staff the company had not paused operations elsewhere besides California and gave no indication that the company was planning to. Instead, Vogt told employees the company was re-evaluating how it discloses information to regulators to ensure it is clearly communicated, according to an account from sources who heard the call.\nCruise had even quietly launched driverless operations in Miami (just a few vehicles), a move that suggested the company was moving ahead despite its significant problems in California.\nWhat changed? Perhaps Cruise execs were pressured by GM or they looked around and realized that they were losing support from other states. Either way, Cruise said it\u2019s now going to examine \u201cprocesses, systems, and tools and reflect on how we can better operate in a way that will earn public trust.\u201d\nThat might be a hefty challenge, especially in California. As the Cruise drama unfolded, opposition against robotaxis grew in cities like Los Angeles.

The tiny car in question? Project X, a concept built by the Foxconn-led Mobility in Harmony Consortium (MIH). The cute little EV is a three-seater; the spot in the backseat where you\u2019d normally seat a fourth person is taken up by two Gogoro battery pack slots.\nAt the event, MIH said it aims to sell 100,000 of the minicars per year in India, Thailand and Japan starting in 2025. The company will initially target fleet operators and ride-hailing services rather than individual customers. MIH says Project X supports autonomous driving Levels 2 to 4 depending on the user\u2019s needs. The price isn\u2019t yet fixed, but should top around $20,000.\nIt\u2019s not clear if Gogoro\u2019s swappable batteries will be used to power the vehicles going forward. After all, that would require Gogoro to set up a swapping network in those regions. But if so, it would signal a new revenue stream for the company, which has been struggling to reach profitability amid softening demand and large investments into international expansion.\n\u2014 Rebecca Bellan\nDeal of the week\nWell this is a fun one.\nFlexport is in talks to acquire the technology of Convoy, the once buzzy digital freight startup that abruptly shuttered after failing to find a buyer. This possible deal, which was reported by WSJ, didn\u2019t have any other details, but it still made me raise an eyebrow.\nLest you forget, Flexport founder Ryan Petersen just took back the CEO title after his hand-picked successor was pushed out. Petersen\u2019s big message has been getting the company\u2019s financial house back in order and has criticized former CEO Dave Clark of overspending, specifically around hiring and expanding too quickly. Petersen has spent the past month cutting costs, including laying off about 20% of its workers, or about 600 people.\nIf Flexport acquires the technology, the company plans to restore Convoy\u2019s trucking services for as many customers and partners as possible, according to WSJ\u2019s source. And folks, that\u2019s going to cost money. Is Petersen\u2019s reign of financial frugality already over?\nOther deals that got my attention \u2026\nFaction, the driverless tech developer, raised an undisclosed amount in a round led by TDK Ventures. Ducera Partners, Trucks Venture Capital and Fifty Years also joined the round.\nOla Electric raised $384.4 million in a funding round, which included about $240 million in debt. Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Temasek led the funding round and Indian government-backed lender State Bank of India bankrolled the debt. The new round values the Bengaluru-headquartered electric vehicle startup at about $5.4 billion\nPony.ai, the Chinese autonomous vehicle startup, scored $100 million from Neom, Saudi Arabia\u2019s futuristic city and development project. As part of the deal, a joint venture will be established to develop, manufacture and deploy autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructure in Neom and key markets in the Middle East North Africa region.\nNeom also announced plans this week to set up a $10 billion joint venture with Danish freight forwarder DSV.\nStellantis made a \u20ac1.5 billion deal ($1.59 billion) to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle maker Zhejiang Leapmotor Technologies, just days after ending manufacturing in the country. The deal includes the formation of Leapmotor International, a 51% to 49% Stellantis-led joint venture that has exclusive rights for the export and sale, as well as manufacturing, of Leapmotor products outside China.\nNotable reads and other tidbits\nAutonomous vehicles\nWaymo driverless vehicles are now available through the Uber app, starting with Phoenix. The launch comes five months since the two companies announced a multi-year agreement for the autonomous vehicle service to be accessed via the Uber app.\nElectric vehicles, batteries & charging\nFord is delaying about $12 billion in planned investments on EVs, including construction of a second battery plant with joint venture partner SK On due to softening demand for higher-priced premium electric vehicles. While EV sales have grown, consumers aren\u2019t willing to pay a premium for an EV over a gas or hybrid vehicle. That price pressure has squeezed profits, and in the case of Ford\u2019s EV business caused losses to grow.\nGeneral Motors and long-time partner Honda have ended plans to build millions of affordable and smaller electric vehicles as the automakers come to terms with high interest rates and battery costs coupled with softening EV demand. Anyone spotting a trend here?\nNikola, the electric and hydrogen-powered heavy truck maker, was awarded $165 million from its founder and former executive chairman, Trevor Milton, in an arbitration proceeding.\nNio has opened its 2,000th Power Swap Station in China, nearing its goal to build 2,300 stations by the end of 2023. The company has expanded on its strategy of swapping out EV batteries, rather than charging them, an infrastructure-intensive process that has the potential to make topping up a battery as quick as filling up a gas tank.\nTesla has the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 again. This time it has received requests for information, including subpoenas from the DOJ related to perks, the advertised range of its EVs and personnel decisions.\nIn-car and mobile tech\nGoogle Maps and Waze stopped live traffic updates in Israel and the Gaza Strip at the request of the Israel Defense Forces. A Google spokesperson said the ability to see live traffic conditions and business information was halted temporarily out of \u201cconsideration for the safety of local communities.\u201d Google did something similar in 2022 amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine because the apps were being used to track military movements.\nXPeng, often called the Chinese challenger to Tesla, has removed high-definition mapping in its XNGP assisted driving feature following its rival\u2019s lead.\nRide-hailing and car-sharing\nRapido, the eight-year-old Indian bike taxi startup, is expanding into the cab market in the South Asian nation, where Uber and its homegrown competitor Ola dominate.\nPeer-to-peer car-sharing marketplace Turo has introduced a buy-now-pay-later option. Now you can reserve a car without immediately paying for it until seven days before a trip. Turo says it built the BNPL option in-house.\nUAW strike\nProgress was made as the United Autoworkers strike wrapped up its sixth week. The UAW struck tentative deals with Ford and Stellantis this past week. Workers still have to ratify the deal, but with UAW president Shawn Fain\u2019s support that outcome is likely.\nHowever, over at GM, it appears that negotiations are moving in the opposite direction. The UAW called for a surprise walkout at GM\u2019s Spring Hill, Tennessee factory, a plant where 4,000 workers assemble engines and three Cadillac models.\n\nThis article, authored by Kirsten Korosec, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":537}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nThis time was supposed to be different. This Ireland team were different\u2026 are different. But, come the end, the result was the same. On quarter-final weekend, for the eighth time in 10 Rugby World Cups, Ireland head home defeated and the wait for a first-ever knockout win goes on.\nYou could feel the desperation around the Stade de France, awash with green thanks to the Irish fans doing their part, as Ireland went through phase after phase after phase after phase hunting the try that could overturn the 28-24 scoreline staring back at them from the giant screen.\nA move that started well inside their own half, with 77 minutes on the clock, ended 37 phases and five minutes later in heartbreak. Thirty-seven gruelling phases of Bundee Aki grinding out extra yards with each punishing carry, Tadhg Beirne left at a literal standstill through tiredness and Johnny Sexton \u2013 for the final time ahead of retirement \u2013 running the famous wraparound upon which he\u2019s built maybe the greatest Ireland career of all-time. But it ended, almost inevitably, with a turnover deep in the New Zealand 22, the ball being kicked to touch and the men in green sinking to the floor bereft.\nThis is the greatest Ireland team of all time, they may still even be the best team in the world but on this day, the quarter-final curse, not to mention an inspired All Blacks side, ruled once more.\nThis defeat will hurt more than any other. Truthfully, since 1991 when Michael Lynagh\u2019s late try handed Australia victory, Ireland hadn\u2019t come close to ending their last-eight hoodoo. Never mind winning one, they haven\u2019t led a World Cup quarter-final since the first half of the 1995 defeat to France, a mammoth 10,353 days ago.\nBut here they had a legitimate chance to reverse the curse. Multiple times they got within a point of the All Blacks, only for their opponents to agonisingly pull away once more. And then there were those 37 phases\u2026 the most painful finish in Irish rugby history.\nIreland were left bereft after an agonising defeat (PA Wire)\nInstead of being feted as the heroes to finally overcome that insurmountable obstacle, the Ireland players will still have to answer endless questions about the heavy burden of previous knockout failures and fans will endure at least four more years of choking jokes at their expense.\nAs for the All Blacks, they looked lost at times during this World Cup cycle and it\u2019s still faintly remarkable that head coach Ian Foster survived last summer as the home defeats to Ireland, South Africa and Argentina piled up.\nYet somehow, he hung on and turned things round. He has the unwanted title of being the first New Zealand coach to lose a World Cup pool match but now a semi-final awaits next Friday evening against an Argentina side that, frankly, are a tier below them. Forget the hand-wringing ahead of the tournament, the All Blacks are one very small step away from another World Cup final.\nFoster will leave his role after the World Cup, to be replaced by all-conquering Crusaders boss Scott Robertson, but he can still exit with the greatest prize of all. And frankly, who would bet against the All Blacks now?\nThe opening-night nerves against France seem a long time ago and they ultimately had too much for Ireland in this simply incredible, back-and-forth Test match that may genuinely go down as one of the best of all time.\nAfter early penalties from Richie Mo\u2019unga and Jordie Barrett, they scored a scintillating try through Leicester Fainga\u2019anuku, who was only in the starting XV due to Mark Telea\u2019s breach of team protocol earlier in the week. Beauden Barrett expertly dinked over the top, collected his own chip and when the ball was spread wide, Fainga\u2019anuku and Rieko Ioane neatly combined to send the former over in the corner.\nNew Zealand played some scintillating rugby in victory (AFP via Getty Images)\nThey led 13-0 and though they may not have realised, no team had ever squandered a lead that large in a World Cup quarter-final. Not that they would have expected an easy ride from there.\nThey conceded a penalty straight from the restart as their kick chase was illegally impeded and Sexton duly slotted the three.\nIreland had made something of a statement during the Haka as their fans drowned it out with a rousing rendition of Fields of Athenry and the players formed a figure of eight in memory of ex-international and Munster coach Anthony Foley, who tragically died in 2016, as they stared down their opponents. But the first real in-match statement came on 27 minutes as New Zealand-born Aki \u2013 perhaps the player of the World Cup so far who had made a tournament-high 61 carries, 33 dominant carries and 23 defenders beaten heading into the weekend \u2013 brilliantly jinked inside two defenders, fended off another and powered through a gap to dive over the line.\nYet more All-Black class saw Ardie Savea go over in the corner after quick ball was shipped wide but with scrum-half Aaron Smith in the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on, Ireland narrowed the gap to 18-17 just before the break as another New Zealand-born Irish star, Jamison Gibson-Park, sniped from a lineout maul and somehow stretched out for the try.\nThe All Blacks extended an incredible record of leading at half-time of their quarter-final in every single World Cup but that lead had never felt more fragile.\nThe All Blacks eventually prevailed in Paris (Reuters)\nThe second half followed a similar, rollercoaster pattern as every time Ireland got close, their opponents found a way to stretch the lead. Mo\u2019unga\u2019s sumptuous dummy and sleight of hand from first-phase lineout ball froze two Irish defenders and led to a scything break before he fed speedster Will Jordan to race over the whitewash.\nThat extended the gap to eight points but a penalty try as an Irish driving maul was illegally hauled down closed it to 25-24 with 17 minutes to go and sent Codie Taylor for 10 minutes in the sin-bin.\nYet this All Blacks team suddenly have a resilience about them and brushed off the underdog status they had been given in the build-up to this game as their tireless back row continually disrupted breakdowns and a disciplined defence refused to yield.\nJordie Barrett added a penalty to take the score to 28-24 and that\u2019s how it eventually stayed. While Ireland will rue the 37 phases that ended in heartbreak, they may just go down in New Zealand rugby history. Tired bodies made tackle after tackle and not a single penalty was given away.\nThe delight at the final whistle showed this wasn\u2019t just any quarter-final victory and while Ireland ponder just what they have to do to finally win a World Cup knockout match, the All Blacks can dream of lifting the Webb Ellis Cup for a fourth time. The pain and ecstasy of sport writ large.\n\nThis article, authored by Luke Baker, was published by The Independent - Sports on 2023-10-14 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":538}
{"title":"CEO David Baszucki\u2019s mission to make Roblox a billion-player platform","context":"## CEO David Baszucki\u2019s mission to make Roblox a billion-player platform\n\nThe Code Conference wrapped up a few days back, and we\u2019re bringing you the last of our interviews from the event. My friend and colleague, Verge deputy editor Alex Heath, sat down to chat with Roblox CEO David Baszucki live onstage.\nEarlier this year, Roblox announced grand plans to build an audience of adults. You probably think of Roblox as a kid thing \u2014 we reported in 2020 that half of all US kids under 16 had played it \u2014 but the last time David and Alex chatted, the company had big plans to change all that, and Alex asked how all of that was going.\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here!\nRoblox is determined to be a platform, even more than a product \u2014 something users can develop games and experiences within. It sounds quite a lot like a metaverse idea, but you\u2019ll hear David say he doesn\u2019t particularly like using that term.\nAnd of course, it was the Code Conference, so David and Alex talked about AI, which was a real theme of our show. David said support for AI is woven all through Roblox\u2019s business, starting with largely invisible functions like efficiency, translation, and safety. But he also sees a lot of opportunity for generative AI to help content creators on the Roblox platform in the not-so-distant future.\nOkay, this is a good one. David Baszucki, CEO of Roblox, live onstage at Code with Alex Heath. Here we go.\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nPlease welcome to the stage the founder and CEO of Roblox, David Baszucki.\nThank you.\nThanks for doing this, Dave. You are fresh off of your annual developer conference, just two weeks ago in San Francisco. I watched the opening keynotes. It seemed like the biggest crowd reaction you got was PlayStation support actually. So I guess my first question is, what took so long?\nIt\u2019s a great question, and thank you for having me here. We\u2019ve put so much focus on mobile quality over the last couple years. It\u2019s our hugest market. We started as a PC product, went to Mac, and the vision of connecting people around the world on every platform has always been the vision. Mobile, we got into really good shape, Xbox in good shape, and then we started rolling out new platforms. As you can imagine, the creator community loves PlayStation because all of their existing creations are going to work there. So for all of these creators that are making a living and making new businesses, it\u2019s just an immediate expansion of their business.\nWas there anything unique about PlayStation from an economics or business partnership perspective that took time, or was it all technical?\nNothing too unique. I think every platform has been very thoughtful in when they start to allow social cross-platform everywhere. I think five or 10 years ago, when we started this notion, Xbox and PlayStation were arguably a little more walled garden-ish, but that vision of connecting and communicating in a 3D space no matter where you are with the best user interface, the best camera, the best motion, whether it\u2019s a phone or a console, I think has really come to bear right now.\nThere\u2019s a lot of product, big-picture stuff I want to get into \u2014 AI, etc. First, though, I want to touch quickly on the layoffs that you guys recently did in your recruiting division.\nYeah.\nI think you had not done layoffs during the pandemic, am I correct?\nWe actually are continuing to hire. We\u2019ve never done layoffs. One thing I think you can see, though, is probably in Q1 of 2023, we were growing our headcount at 50 percent a year, which is very rapid, and that requires a very, very large recruiting team. We\u2019ve committed and we\u2019ve shared the notion that over next year, our bookings are going to grow faster than our headcount, so our headcount growth is probably not going to be 50 percent next year.\nSo that doesn\u2019t say anything bigger about the state of your business?\nNo, absolutely not. I think we\u2019ve done this amazing job of just continuing to grow steadily through all of this over the last two years.\nLet\u2019s talk about aging up the platform. So you have been making this big push to get people above 17 on the platform with exclusive experiences. You\u2019re verifying identity with ID. It\u2019s relatively new. You\u2019re only, I think, a couple months in or so. How\u2019s it going? Actually, I made a new Roblox account from scratch.\nI did it purposefully to see the experience, so this is about two hours ago. And the front page for me after I put my age and everything, was still a lot of games that, frankly, I\u2019m not going to play. Kids games. So it seems like you\u2019re still kind of lagging on that content that would get someone like me on the platform.\nThe fastest-growing segment on the platform is users aged 17 to 24, growing north of 33 percent year on year\nI think that\u2019s a leading indicator. If we roll back the clock four, five, six, seven years when we were much smaller pre-public, that vision of creating an immersive platform that connects people around the world, that allows them to socialize, do things together, we even saw back then this has to be in every country. This has to be in all ages. So we started with the notion that this is going to be a platform for six-year-olds and 60-year-olds. The most recent earnings report, we shared that 17 through 24 is the fastest-growing segment on the platform, growing I think north of 33 percent year on year. So we\u2019ve actually stopped using the term \u201caging up\u201d right now. We have a very substantial over-17 user base. The thing you were experiencing is we have started allowing our creators, when you\u2019re validated with your photo ID and we know for sure you\u2019re 17, to start easing into some of those more mature experiences that you might consider kind of grown-up experience.\nI\u2019ve seen some trailers, like there was one you guys showed at RDC a couple of weeks ago that looked like Grand Theft Auto in Roblox. I mean, the graphics were very impressive. It\u2019s not the blocky kind of thing that you think of with Roblox, and so I can see where it\u2019s going. But I guess right now when you\u2019re telling me that that demographic is growing the fastest, what are they doing on the platform? Because I don\u2019t see the experiences that \u2014\nIt\u2019s surprising the amount of older people that play just a wide range of experiences and come to socialize. I was in Canada hanging out with some third cousin at a family reunion, a 24-year-old guy who works on the railroad as an engineer, and he said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m really excited to meet you because all of the mechanics at CN Railroad [Canadian National Railway] are playing Roblox.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat is going on? That\u2019s too good to be true.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re playing Jailbreak, and we\u2019re playing some of these experiences.\u201d So they are playing these experiences. The level of social, the level of immersion, the level of being together with your friends no matter where they are is somewhat universal. So that\u2019s doing surprisingly well for us.\nThis is kind of a big-picture question, but I\u2019m curious about what you want to be. I think there\u2019s this interesting gap between where Roblox is today, what it\u2019s been historically, and how you talk about the company.\nIn my mind, you could easily be content to just go after the entire gaming market. I mean, it\u2019s bigger than the music and the movie industry combined. But you seem more focused on building a next-generation almost social network. You talk about this as a communications platform. Why go that direction? Is the gaming industry not big enough?\n\u201cOur belief is, this type of technology is bigger than gaming\u201d\nI think that\u2019s a great question. I mean, we\u2019ve shared publicly that our goal would be to get to a billion daily active people on the platform. And I think our vision of what we\u2019re working on goes really almost to the future of communication. It goes to the evolution of the mail system, to the telegraph system, to the phone system, to, as we saw in covid, the video system. We just think inevitably there\u2019s a generation beyond that, which is immersive 3D communication, whether it\u2019s playing together, whether it\u2019s trying to graduate from high school together during the midst of covid, whether it\u2019s a simulation of our Roblox office inside Roblox. We go and have a simulation of our office, and we come together for serendipitous events, whether it\u2019s going to a concert. So our belief is, this type of technology is bigger than gaming. Gaming is a part of it, side-by-side concerts and working together, so I think we\u2019ve evolved to a utility vision of this type of platform.\nI think you made a prediction at RDC a couple of weeks ago about dating. You think people are going to be dating in Roblox.\nIt was really fun when we made this prediction because we were very careful on that slide. And then you saw the 17-plus people ID validated in 17-plus experiences.\nSo parents don\u2019t have a heart attack.\nYeah, yeah, yeah, given our history of safety and civility and the focus on that. But ultimately, what\u2019s really interesting about the dating market, there\u2019s probably a third of the population that won\u2019t go on Bumble or Tinder or Hinge or whatever just because of awkwardness. In an immersive 3D avatar-type communication where you can be Shrek and I can be whoever I want to be, there\u2019s actually a certain way to... I\u2019ll be Donald Duck.\nOkay. [Laughs]\nThere\u2019s actually a little bit of a breakdown of the friction, of the fear of a video call, so I actually do believe that\u2019ll happen. I do believe someday someone will build a dating app on Roblox. It\u2019ll be very safe. It\u2019ll be for 17-and-up people, and it\u2019ll be an interesting way for people to connect.\nTalk to me about this advertising push you guys are also making and how it connects to the changing demographics of the user base. Are they related? And how big do you see the ads business becoming?\nI think it\u2019s really interesting. The amount of engagement is north of 5 billion hours per month on the platform, and more and more of that is north of 17-year-old engagement. And when we think about what advertising is, a lot of it is fandom. It\u2019s seeing a poster of something I like, maybe historically seeing something in a newspaper. More recently seeing something as a web banner, and then more recently seeing something as a very native natural video segment or something like that. But we do believe there\u2019s something beyond that, which is the 3D experience. For example, if we\u2019re in a retail store together and we\u2019re shopping and we can remember what\u2019s on the shelf and how it looks, whether it\u2019s shoes or makeup or whatever, and we do think that\u2019s going to be a very, very powerful experience for brands.\nWe already have hundreds of brands on the platform. I was just seeing the most revised Gucci experience, which is radically amazing. It\u2019s a simulation of their runway show. And in those experiences, there\u2019s both brand recognition, which is maybe harder to measure. There starts to be the acquisition of virtual goods: Gucci purses and those kinds of things. And then, ultimately, there\u2019ll be at some point, not yet really announced or promised, physical shopping as well. That kind of shopping with your friend is a very social, fun experience.\nHow big do you see the ads business being? Is it something that could potentially be as big as your core business today?\n\u201cOur CFO\u2019s friend was ... walking by a Vans store, and younger people wanted to go in there because they were familiar with that from Vans World on Roblox.\u201d\nIt\u2019s interestingly big. We\u2019re in a great position because we generate a really good business without advertising. So it gives us an opportunity to layer this in for older people in a very civil way, in a very careful way. But I think it\u2019s arguably undetermined how big it is. We will see based on the power of the memories that people have in their brands. Anecdotally, our CFO\u2019s friend was in Santa Monica and walking by a Vans store, and younger people wanted to go in there because they were familiar with that from Vans World on Roblox. So building digital memories and connecting with brands that are fun and exciting and then merging that with the physical world is new, uncharted territory.\nOn the topic of growth, this is something I haven\u2019t heard you talk about since you went public. A big part of your growth narrative when you went public, it was mentioned many times in the prospectus, for example, was this joint venture you had with Tencent in China. And less than a year after you went public, it got shut down without explanation.\nYeah.\nI saw that your head of China is now your head of Japan.\nThat\u2019s right.\nWhere are you with China?\nTencent continues to be an amazing partner. We\u2019re being very, very careful in China. The dynamics in China right now have gone to the point where, rather than envisioning a fully connected-type network, we have to imagine an autonomous network. We\u2019re, in a sense, modernizing our infrastructure to the point where we can literally print a copy of Roblox in China and bring it to market there. So we continue to be very involved in China. We\u2019re optimistic about it. We have a great partnership with Tencent, but we\u2019re working on the infrastructure to support that.\nWhat does that mean, \u201can autonomous version\u201d of Roblox?\nI think as you would look at any other platform or any other social media-type company, we would look back over the last three to four years and see less and less information going back and forth between the US and China to the point where I think the future will be very little goes back, for example, in a China situation.\nSo you haven\u2019t given up on China?\nAbsolutely not. No.\nOkay, interesting. So you recently put Roblox on the Meta Quest headset, and it\u2019s not officially in the store yet, but you got 1 million installs in five days, and it was just in a beta where you have to go find it. You can\u2019t just go download it from the store.\nThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.\nWhere do you see VR going as it relates to Roblox? There\u2019s the Vision Pro. Have you tried the Vision Pro?\nI have not tried a Vision Pro.\nYou\u2019ve got to try it. Will you guys be on Vision Pro? Are you a big believer in this headset wave that\u2019s coming?\nI\u2019m a big believer, long term, that the most immersive form of 3D experience will be VR-type experience. There\u2019s some great sci-fi around what the far-off future of VR is. I think our vision is, because we are a platform and because we work so hard on\u2026 young creator shows up, builds something on Roblox, pushes a button, runs on any device, is auto-translated into any language, possibly that can build a business on top of that, there\u2019s a huge benefit to being very, very good on all devices and tracking the growth of devices. So we can contribute to the growth of Meta Quest, and I\u2019m excited about that. If someday there are 500,000 or 500 million VR headsets, Roblox will be a huge part of it, but I think we\u2019re not in the position of predicting the growth of any hardware device.\nWhat about AR? So not fully immersive, but AR glasses.\nAR is also super interesting, right? Is the future going to be mixed reality? Is the future going to be lighter weight, less overlaid type stuff? Is the future ultimately going to be some of the vision of some of the companies that have been started? Someday, I think I wrote a blog post about it 10 years ago, we will have full overlay, whether it\u2019s contact lenses, and it\u2019ll be lightweight and all of that. I think AR is very interesting when we think about immersive 3D communication because there\u2019s communication where we\u2019re simulating this world and we\u2019re sitting here together. There\u2019s also communication where grandma and grandpa are sitting at the kitchen table, and I think AR starts to support that vision of some people are on VR devices, some people are on AR devices. You can either put grandma and grandpa in the chair, or you can go to the favorite family destination. So I think it\u2019s very interesting.\nWe\u2019re going to have time for Q&A in a few minutes, so get your questions ready. We\u2019ll have time for three or four questions.\nYou and I, a few months ago when we did the interview for Decoder, we talked a lot about AI and this kind of analogy to... I don\u2019t know if people have seen the last season of Westworld. The main character has this job where she just goes in and talks to a computer and creates virtual worlds as a narrator. And you said you see that happening on Roblox in the not-too-distant future. You all talked a little bit more about this at RDC a couple of weeks ago. Where does generative AI intersect with what Roblox does?\nI think one way to think about this is three big AI clouds that are accelerating creation and supporting the platform. One of these clouds has been there for two or three years, no one knows it. Safety, automatic translation, moderation, efficiency, we\u2019ve been working on that for two or three years, and we probably have 70 AI pipelines to drive the efficiency of the business and the quality of the business.\nThe middle cloud, which I think is a lot of energy right now \u2014 generative \u2014 how easy is it to make creation happen for everyone? Vision on Roblox would be in addition to, say, competing on Project Runway and using digital scissors and a digital sewing machine, we would also use prompts. I\u2019d like a blue shirt, buttons this color, and AI will start to generate that.\nSo AI generative is very interesting for avatars, for clothing, for 3D experiences to really bring creation to everyone, and we\u2019re deep in on that. We\u2019ve already shipped AI code generation to help creators create. We\u2019ve shipped AI material generation. I think having a company with amazing... A lot of user data flowing can help support and train those types of models.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a third cloud way out there, which is starting to imagine having a virtual doppelganger ... that\u2019s the more sci-fi future.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a third cloud way out there, which is starting to imagine having a virtual doppelganger, for example. If you wanted someone to take your place, if you wanted someone to meet me for five minutes before our meeting to just kind of figure things out, I think that\u2019s the way-off-far future. And it\u2019s not just generative AI, but it\u2019s generative AI that might look and act like you in a virtual space. So that\u2019s the more sci-fi future.\nSo that\u2019s an AI trained on my Roblox persona and data to be like me?\nThat\u2019s right. If you so choose and you so want that, then that could be an opportunity.\nAudience Q&A\nAlex Heath: Dave is very good at these Q&As. He does them a lot at his conferences.\nDavid Baszucki: I don\u2019t. Oh, I do them with developers.\nAH: Yeah, I\u2019m just saying give him good questions. Give him hard questions.\nDB: Thank you, I think.\nCathy Hackl: Hi Alex and David. Cathy Hackl. I\u2019m a tech and gaming executive at Journey, a Roblox player, and the mother of an 11-year-old Roblox developer that makes about a hundred dollars a month from his builds.\nDB: Oh, my gosh.\nCH: So, yay. Yeah. During RDC, you gave one of your predictions. You said a top fashion designer will be discovered on Roblox without having any experience in physical fashion. What is the role of fashion in the future of Roblox and direct-to-avatar?\nDB: It\u2019s huge, right? Karlie [Kloss] is on our platform. Parsons [School of] Design did a partnership with us. At RDC, we saw a couple of the gowns that had been done in concert with some of the students there. They were absolutely amazing. So one could imagine reducing the friction of creativity for a fashion designer to ultimately virtual design \u2014 and then, ultimately, AI-supported design.\nIt\u2019s interesting to imagine this as a prototype environment for fashion. You can try a lot of things more quickly than building the physical. You can get crowd feedback. There will someday be experiences where early designs are voted on. We\u2019ve had things like that in a more simplistic way, and then you can imagine almost predicting what types of designs from top designers would be welcomed. So I think it\u2019s really big. Thank you.\nNeil Shankar: Hi, my name is Neil Shankar. I\u2019m a content creator. I have always thought of Roblox as largely a metaverse company. In fact, my introduction to the metaverse concepts was from a series of essays that Matthew Ball wrote a few years ago that Roblox was largely the center of. Recently, I\u2019ve become aware of a brand marketing push, I believe by your sports division, to distance yourselves from metaverse connotations. Can you please tell us about that?\nDB: I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s a distancing. We have evolved the terminology we\u2019ve used. We\u2019ve always used the term \u201chuman co-experience\u201d or \u201cbringing people together.\u201d The metaverse context, as we know, was coined with the book Snow Crash a long time ago. And it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s gone and ebbed through various flows. But I guess we imagine this more as a communication and connection platform. We\u2019ve never really used the term metaverse a lot, and I think going forward, we\u2019ll probably always think of ourselves as a communication and connection platform.\nAlex Kruglov: Hi, my name is Alex Kruglov. I run a startup called pop.in, which is also in the social gaming space but for a much older user base. I\u2019m curious: when you think about 24 hours in a day and you talk about the future that you see with a billion daily actives and all kinds of time spent not just playing games but anything from dating to shopping and so on, what are people not going to be doing and switching? Clay Christensen has this concept of jobs to be done. Who are they firing? What jobs are they firing in order to be on Roblox?\nI asked this from the point of view of a parent of three kids, the middle of whom \u2014 for all intents and purposes, it\u2019s crack when it comes to Roblox. It\u2019s highly, highly regulated by her parents.\nAH: Yeah, how dystopian is this going to be?\nDB: Yeah. We\u2019re actually very optimistic. And I think we\u2019re optimistic because, in the specter of social media, there\u2019s a wide range of things that people do on social media. Some consume a lot of short video content and trigger dopamine. Some are \u201ccompare my life with your life and accelerate FOMO.\u201d Some are hopefully similar to the feeling of, \u201cWell, my kid\u2019s on the phone with their friends. They\u2019re connecting, inventing, hanging out.\u201d So I\u2019m actually somewhat optimistic that the future of our direction is bringing people together when they can\u2019t be in real life.\nCasey Newton: Hi. Casey Newton from Platformer. When I look at Roblox, I see something that looks a lot like an app store that increasingly looks like it wants to be an operating system, which to me, would seem to put it on a kind of collision course with an iOS or an Android or maybe even the Oculus Store. So I wonder how you think about that and how you think you can get to that billion daily active people without owning your own hardware.\nDB: One thing to think about when we imagine millions of creators and we can go to ancient Egypt or we can go to our office or whatever in immersive 3D is that content cannot all be shipped to the device. It\u2019s just impossible to have that much content. So that content needs to come to the device in a very unique architecture where there\u2019s very low latency, there\u2019s a lot of local 3D simulation, but at the same time, on the cloud, that content needs to load and connect very fast. And I think this architectural inevitability of a 3D connection platform where we can go everywhere instantly is maybe what you\u2019re thinking about or referring to. I would say, Apple, these platforms, are very aware of this inevitable architecture for 3D and are actually very big supporters of it.\nAndrew Melnizek: Hey. Andrew with The Verge. Last week, we saw some leaked internal emails from Microsoft\u2019s Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, and he talked about the future of AAA game publishing and development. It\u2019s just really expensive. People have to take bigger bets to succeed, and it\u2019s getting harder and harder. I wanted to get your take, as someone who I would argue has defined the iPad kids generation, in what their relationship with games is going to be in the future as the model continues to change.\n\u201cWe have nothing near a bull\u2019s-eye on AAA gaming\u201d\nDB: Internally, we have nothing near a bull\u2019s-eye on AAA gaming. Internally, there\u2019s always a struggle to have all of our engineers working on midrange Android phones as a primary, very difficult platform. So I think our focus is on performance, on midrange, low-end devices, rather than the high-end. Over time, you could imagine even those low-end devices start to support more and more realism, and it becomes easier to deploy on the cloud, have an existing social network, and those kinds of things. So there may be some natural evolution but definitely nothing deliberate on our part.\nJay Peters: Hi. Jay Peters with The Verge. You mentioned walled gardens in terms of PlayStation and Xbox, but I kind of feel like Roblox is its own walled garden. We see lots of other shared virtual experience apps like Fortnite or Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds. Is there any chance or any thinking on some kind of interoperability between all that stuff?\nDB: I think there are two types of interoperability. One would just be on valuable items like a pair of shoes from Nike and whether the NFT supports the interchange. That may not be a 3D graphical technical spec; that may be a little bit more of a cloud ownership spec. I think that this genre is evolving so quickly to network hundreds of people to have realistic 3D. Are my shoes ultimately made of leather? Do they actually bend and flex? The technology is going to go so quickly here that any 3D interchange is going to be almost like a five-year-old file format. So I think, if you see maybe less interchange, I think it\u2019s less that way. We do bring in every type of industry file format that we can, and we\u2019re trying to open that up as fast as we can.\nJP: Do you think five years out, will there be energy toward creating some kind of interchangeable file format or is that something \u2014\nDB: I think there is already. I think because Roblox is based on, under the covers, really trying to be a 3D world simulator. The wheels fall off the car, the car falls on the ground, your clothing is made of cloth, those kinds of things \u2014 those file formats may not support a kind of physically rich description. So I imagine, for a long time, when we bring in avatar files or something, we\u2019ll be using AI to upsample them into a physical manifestation.\nJP: Thank you.\nAH: Alright, we\u2019re getting pulled off the stage here. Dave, thank you for the time.\n\nThis article, authored by Nilay Patel, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-12 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":539}
