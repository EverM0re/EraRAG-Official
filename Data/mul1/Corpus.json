{"title":"The Soccer Star on the Verge of Breaking an 89-Year-Old Record","context":"## The Soccer Star on the Verge of Breaking an 89-Year-Old Record\n\nErling Haaland is just six away from Norway\u2019s goalscoring record, so it is surely inevitable that he will soon be his nation\u2019s most prolific striker ever.\nOn one hand, that will have happened remarkably quickly \u2013 Haaland only scored his first goals for Norway in 2020. On the other, this has been an incredibly long time coming.\nGO DEEPER What is Haaland really like?\nOf the 213 FIFA-affiliated nations, Norway\u2019s is the longest-standing outright individual goalscoring record in the world. It was set by Jorgen Juve, a fascinating figure who ended his international career in 1937 and later became a renowned sports journalist in his home country.\nAdvertisement\nJuve scored a relatively modest 33 goals in 45 matches for Norway, including five hat-tricks, although his tally is made remarkable by the fact he played as a centre-forward in less than half of those games. He was otherwise positioned in defence, from where he captained his nation to the bronze medal at the 1936 Olympics. That explains why his final international goal came three years before his final cap, in June 1934. Therefore, it is likely that by the time Haaland scores six more goals, it will be around 90 years since Juve reached the 33-goal mark.\nThere is technically one other record that stands for longer, also in Scandinavia.\nPoul \u201cTist\u201d Nielsen scored 52 goals in 38 games for Denmark between 1910 and 1925, although his record was equalled by Jon Dahl Tomasson \u2014 now manager of Blackburn Rovers in the English Championship \u2014 in 2010. Tomasson elected to retire from international football after that year\u2019s World Cup in South Africa rather than seeking to make the record his own. Nielsen\u2019s name therefore remains in the record books, although he now holds Denmark\u2019s record only jointly.\nThis graph demonstrates the extent to which these records are outliers.\nOnly six countries\u2019 goalscoring records have stood for more than 50 years, including Libya, Sudan and Guinea. Therefore, if we only include nations to have qualified for the World Cup, it is only Denmark, Norway and Hungary whose records have lasted more than half a century.\nHungary\u2019s record is perhaps the most impressive, considering Ferenc Puskas scored 84 goals in just 85 games, and his international career was brought to a premature end at the age of 29 because of the Hungarian Revolution. He later represented Spain at the 1962 World Cup, having gone half a decade without playing international football.\nFerenc Puskas (right) playing for Hungary against England at Wembley in 1953 (Barratts\/PA Images via Getty Images)\nThe most striking thing about the graph is how many goalscoring records have been set recently.\nAdvertisement\nSixty-four of the 211 nations\u2019 record goalscorers have appeared for them in 2023, and in terms of time since they were set, the median goalscoring mark has stood for just seven years, which includes the likes of the Republic of Ireland\u2019s Robbie Keane and Paraguay\u2019s Roque Santa Cruz. Increased longevity due to superior fitness levels in the modern game is clearly a major factor, as is the number of relatively new nations on the FIFA list.\nPerhaps the most surprising international goalscoring record is that of Italy.\nGiga Riva\u2019s relatively insubstantial haul of 35 goals has been the mark to beat since World Cup 1974. Not only has it not been matched or eclipsed, but no one has ever got particularly near it \u2014 Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero both reached 27 and that\u2019s as close as anyone has come.\nFor context, four Englishmen have reached 35 goals in that period \u2014 Gary Lineker, Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane. Four Spaniards too \u2014 Raul Gonzalez, Fernando Torres, David Villa and David Silva, while Alvaro Morata (on 34) should get there shortly.\nFurthermore, no current Italians seem set to challenge it \u2014 Ciro Immobile (with 17) has less than half that tally, turns 34 years old in February, and has been omitted from recent squads. Nobody in Luciano Spalletti\u2019s current squad has scored more than eight international goals.\nItaly\u2019s shortcoming clearly isn\u2019t about a complete lack of prolific strikers \u2014 the likes of Christian Vieri, Pippo Inzaghi and Luca Toni all scored heavily at club level. Sometimes it\u2019s been the opposite, with various strikers competing for a starting place, meaning none of them got to dominate the national side for a decade. That said, around a decade ago, there was simply a dearth of prolific Italian strikers to choose from. Antonio Conte used Eder and Graziano Pelle up front at the 2016 European Championship.\nAdvertisement\nThere are also tactical considerations. Not only have Italy traditionally been the most defensive of the major European nations, but their attacking play has generally been based around using a second striker. Baggio, Del Piero and Francesco Totti have all been the golden boy at various \u2014 overlapping \u2014 stages, with Italy\u2019s No 9 often selected primarily to bring the best out of Italy\u2019s No 10.\nWhat of Norway? They, similarly, were traditionally a defensive-minded side, favouring counter-attacks and long balls. At their peak under Egil Olsen in the mid-1990s, they often used a striker out of position on the wing, where he would challenge for long, diagonal balls.\nNorway\u2019s Jostein Flo, a giant striker often utilised on the right flank, at the 1994 World Cup (Chris Cole\/Allsport)\nBut perhaps the more pertinent thing about Norway is that, historically, they generally haven\u2019t been very competitive.\nThey\u2019ve only ever qualified for four major tournaments \u2014 in 1938, 1994, 1998 and 2000 \u2014 and have won a combined three matches in those appearances. They\u2019re also similar to Italy in that, at times, they\u2019ve boasted various high-level strikers whose careers roughly overlapped \u2014 John Carew, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Tore Andre Flo, Steffen Iversen \u2014 and at other points have suffered a complete lack of good centre-forwards.\nAt this point in time, Norway appear to have the most prolific striker in Europe, and it\u2019s not unreasonable to consider where Haaland might end up in the all-time international goalscoring charts worldwide, never mind just in relation to his compatriots.\nHaaland is currently averaging nearly a goal a game for his country, which will inevitably be difficult for the 23-year-old to sustain over his career. But it\u2019s worth pointing out how impressive that is, even at this early stage. Again, excluding countries who have never qualified for a World Cup, only the aforementioned quartet of Juve, Riva, Puskas and Nielsen, plus Japan\u2019s Kunishige Kamamoto, hold their nation\u2019s international goalscoring records and also boast a rate of 0.75 goals per game or more.\nEven Cristiano Ronaldo, the most prolific international goalscorer of all time with 127 for Portugal, boasts \u2018only\u2019 0.63 goals per game, a lower rate than the likes of Romelu Lukaku (Belgium), Kane and Aleksandar Mitrovic (Serbia), which owes to his early days as a winger rather than a central striker.\nKane and Ronaldo, two national-team record scorers still operating in 2023 (Burak Akbulut\/Anadolu Agency\/Getty Images)\nConsidering how many hat-tricks Haaland scores for Manchester City, it\u2019s not beyond the realms of possibility that he could score six goals during this international break to move level with Juve, particularly given Norway\u2019s first fixture is a home friendly against the Faroe Islands today (Thursday), before a European Championship qualifier against Scotland in Glasgow on Sunday. That said, the Faroes\u2019 defence is less leaky than you might expect \u2014 only twice in their last 22 outings have they conceded more than three times in a game.\nAdvertisement\nThe wider question is whether we will ever see Haaland at a major tournament.\nDespite the presence of him and Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard, Norway have failed to qualify from their Euro 2024 qualification group directly, with Spain and Scotland already securing the top two spots.\nThey are, at least, likely to qualify for the play-offs, and therefore will have two must-win games in March to secure their first major tournament appearance since 2000 \u2014 the summer when Haaland was born. But there\u2019s been little in recent performances to think Norway will breeze through those play-offs.\nJuve\u2019s individual record will soon be surpassed, but captaining his side to a bronze medal at the Olympics may stand as his nation\u2019s greatest achievement for much longer.\nGO DEEPER Erling Haaland is phenomenal - so why hasn\u2019t he made Manchester City better?\n(Top photo: Sebastian Widmann \u2013 UEFA\/UEFA via Getty Images)\n\nThis article, authored by The New York Times, was published by The New York Times on 2023-11-17 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":400}
{"title":"Twitch\u2019s money guy talks about the revenue split controversy and its monetization long game","context":"## Twitch\u2019s money guy talks about the revenue split controversy and its monetization long game\n\nTwitch has had a tense year, in part due to community backlash over policy changes that affect the way creators can monetize their content.\nLast year, the company announced that it would end the 70\/30 subscription revenue split deal that it had offered select streamers in favor of prioritizing ad revenue. In June, Twitch launched the Partner Plus program, a new monetization tier that would grant eligible creators a 70\/30 subscription revenue split on the first $100,000 they make per year. The program further strained its relationship with its community, because the requirements to qualify excluded the vast majority of streamers. Streamers need at least 350 monthly paid subscriptions, and gift subs and monthly subs that come with an Amazon Prime account don\u2019t count.\nIn response, Twitch pivoted eligibility to a points-based system, assigning a value to each subscription tier. The higher-priced subscriptions now count more toward the point total.\n\ud83d\udce3 We\u2019re updating how we calculate progress toward the Partner Plus program. To recognize deeper support from your community, Tier 1, 2, and 3 subs will earn you 1, 2, and 6 points respectively towards qualifying for the program. pic.twitter.com\/HdOiLvg3qC \u2014 Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) August 28, 2023\nTwitch also walked back its policy restricting embedded ads and other sponsored content, following fallout from streamers who depend on branded content as the bulk of their income.\nThe company\u2019s CEO Dan Clancy, who took over earlier this year, has prioritized engaging with Twitch streamers, and involving their perspectives in policy changes going forward. The company\u2019s receptiveness to community feedback has marginally lessened animosity from its streamers, and community sentiment toward Twitch at this year\u2019s TwitchCon in Las Vegas was significantly more positive than it was last year. New features and policy changes announced during the convention\u2019s keynote address, including granting streamers more control over ad breaks and allowing simulcasting to other livestreaming platforms, also appeased the Twitch community.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Twitch\u2019s Chief Monetization Officer Mike Minton discussed the unpopular policy decisions, supporting smaller creators through branded partnerships and what Twitch is doing to mend its relationship with its community.\nTechCrunch: I\u2019m going to start with a maybe unpleasant question, but Twitch has made some unpopular decisions in terms of monetization. Is there anything that Twitch is doing to appease irate creators?\nMike Minton: Two years ago, we said we\u2019re no longer gonna do these deals that weren\u2019t objective in terms of eligibility criteria. We ended that program. It affected a relatively small number of creators, but what it really impacted was the community going, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to work for.\u201d And that led to us recently announcing Partner Plus. There was some feedback saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to need a lot of subs,\u201d and we reacted to it by making it eligible by sub points so that your higher price point subscriptions cost more, and that was actually received quite positively.\nBoth Dan and I have said in different forms, that this is the beginning. It\u2019s not the end and we\u2019re going to continue to work to provide access to higher rev shares as we can over time, to more streamers.\nWhat would that look like?\nThe simple answer is now, 350 was the criteria we established, right? And that number is arbitrary and could easily come down. Now, our target and our goal in this program still remains the same. We\u2019re looking to benefit the creators, where livestreaming is a meaningful part of what they\u2019re doing as a creator. That allows us to focus on those streamers that are really at a point where it will matter most for them in terms of keeping them as a livestreaming creator.\nRight, and that decision to change the revenue split also came out of a decision to prioritize ad revenue. Creators and viewers have said that integrating ads in their streams is very frustrating. What kind of feedback is Twitch going to provide in response to that?\nLet\u2019s level set a couple things. So one of the things we knew with ads, if we\u2019re going to get streamers to buy into ads as a good way to monetize, is that we had to increase the rev share, which we did, and launch the ad incentive program.\nWe\u2019re helping streamers understand that with ad running, you have to think about it consistently over time in order to earn predictable revenue. It\u2019s a very reliable source of income for many streamers.\nSo I think the combination of making it easier to run, increasing the rev share and then recently in the keynote, we talked about two new features to allow moderators to know when an ad break is coming, and adjust the ad break around the content because the problem in livestreaming, as you\u2019re aware, is that people don\u2019t want to miss out. So we\u2019re very focused on improving the ad experience by allowing the ad breaks to be synchronized with the content and enrolling moderations and eventually the community in adjusting those ad breaks.\nLike you said, livestreaming is very different from static content, and tactics for monetization that work for Instagram or TikTok just don\u2019t really work for Twitch or any livestreaming platform. In those cases, what has Twitch done differently from those more standard platforms in terms of making monetization more seamless?\nOne thing we\u2019ve done since the beginning, where we are a leader, is getting people to take their wallets out and support creators through subscriptions, gifting, cheering. I think that sets us as a unique community-based platform where viewers are directly supporting creators in that way.\nOther services have tried it but from what I can tell them, what streamers have told me, is that Twitch is really the leader in that way. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time on advertising, because there\u2019s no social media, content distribution service in the world that doesn\u2019t rely on advertising as a component. So ads have been a big focus.\nAnd the third piece, which is where we\u2019re behind, is sponsorships. We\u2019re now focused a lot on growing sponsorship opportunities for streamers and ensuring that we have three \u2014 based on what size you are, where you\u2019re located, how experienced you are, what type of content you\u2019re creating, where you\u2019re located in the world \u2014 three options to support you as a creator.\nI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of creators over the course of my career, and a common gripe seems to be that they can\u2019t subsist off of just subs and ad revenue. They have to have these branded partnerships that are difficult to land for midsize creators and smaller creators. What is Twitch doing specifically to diversify its branded partnership content?\nWe have this unique opportunity, being part of the third largest and fastest growing advertising business in the world, AKA Amazon. So what we\u2019re actively working on is, as advertisers that come in through Amazon advertising, that they understand the magic of Twitch, that they can easily set up influencer deals programmatically. And ultimately, you don\u2019t have the measurement that they expect.\nBut because of Amazon\u2019s diversity of advertisers, this is where before it was more focused on endemic advertisers, game publishers, et cetera. And now we\u2019re able to expand that reach to a much broader set of advertisers and serve the needs of both the affiliate marketing end of sponsorships, which is more of a performance model, as well as more of the top of the funnel, where you\u2019re looking for more brand awareness.\nObviously a lot of this discord among Twitch\u2019s community also comes at a time when other streaming platforms like YouTube or Kick are starting to take off, and enticing streamers with better revenue splits. A common complaint that I\u2019ve heard is that bigger streamers are going to be making money wherever they are, but smaller streamers who have less of an audience don\u2019t qualify for Partner Plus will get a better deal at YouTube or Kick than at Twitch. What is Twitch doing to keep those streamers?\nThere are a couple of things that I\u2019ll point out. One is acknowledging what Dan has done as the CEO to get out and engage with streamers, hear their concerns, and really influence our priorities as a company, is really a consequence of him both being an active streamer as well as being extremely engaged within the community.\nAnd then, more broadly for both Jeremy [Jeremy Forrester is VP of Community Product] and myself as the product leaders, building the product is continuing to innovate and ensure that we are absolutely a unique service. Whether that\u2019s features, like we\u2019re working on Stories, whether that\u2019s monetization \u2014 it\u2019s all in service of ensuring that livestreaming creators can be more successful on Twitch.\nFor a long time, there was a sort of exclusivity with Twitch, where there were exclusive deals, and simultaneous streaming on other platforms was forbidden. I have to wonder if those decisions to change these policies were in response to competition from other platforms.\nI would say it this way: I think they are an acknowledgement, and maybe a closer connectivity to the community via Dan specifically. I credit Dan in his short time as CEO to really make some big, hard decisions. Both the launch of Partner Plus, as well as simulcasting, the embed stuff we talked about in the keynote \u2014 these are three things that I think are very much an acknowledgement of the feedback from the community. We\u2019ve made that change, so I wouldn\u2019t call it out of competitive pressures. I would call it out of focus on the community.\n\nThis article, authored by Morgan Sung, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-26 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":401}
{"title":"Beeper Mini is back in operation after Apple\u2019s attempt to shut it down","context":"## Beeper Mini is back in operation after Apple\u2019s attempt to shut it down\n\nBeeper Mini, the app bringing blue bubble iMessage texts to Android users, is back in operation on Monday after a long weekend that saw Apple putting an end to Beeper\u2019s services, claiming it was a security risk. Now, the startup behind the new app says it has resumed functioning, but hasn\u2019t disclosed how that\u2019s been made possible. In addition, Beeper Mini will be free for the time being given the unstable nature of Beeper\u2019s status and Apple\u2019s attempts at shutting it down.\nFounded by former Pebble smartwatch founder Eric Migicovsky, Beeper had originally been working on an app that aggregated all of a user\u2019s chat apps into a single interface. However, upon the discovery of new technology that allowed it to reverse-engineer the iMessage protocol, it set out to build a new app called Beeper Mini that solely focused on bringing iMessage chats to Android users for $1.99 per month. That included support for high-quality photos and videos, tapback reactions, typing indicators, read receipts and more.\nThe app quickly climbed into the top 20 in the Play Store\u2019s charts and saw over 100,000 downloads in its first 48 hours, the company claims.\nUnfortunately, Beeper Mini\u2019s success was short-lived. Only days after launching, Apple on Friday night took action against the startup, having found a way to stop Beeper Mini\u2019s messages from being passed from Android phones to its servers. The Cupertino tech giant explained that it needed to shut down the app because it \u201cposed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks.\u201d Essentially, Apple said that it couldn\u2019t verify that Beeper\u2019s claims of end-to-end encryption were true, and therefore it needed to take \u201csteps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage.\u201d\nAs the Beeper team scrambled for a fix, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) shamed Apple for its intervention in a post on X, formerly Twitter, saying \u201cGreen bubble texts are less secure. So why would Apple block a new app allowing Android users to chat with iPhone users on iMessage? Big Tech executives are protecting profits by squashing competitors. Chatting between different platforms should be easy and secure,\u201d she wrote.\nOn Monday, Beeper announced on its blog that it has updated the Beeper Mini app to fix the issue that \u201ccaused messages not to be sent or received.\u201d It hasn\u2019t said exactly how it\u2019s made that happen, but notes that the security of Beeper Mini remains unchanged \u2014 promising it still includes local, end-to-end encryption as previously described. Migicovsky told TechCrunch he can\u2019t share anything on that topic beyond what\u2019s already in the blog post.\nThough Beeper Mini is running again, there is a caveat: phone number registration isn\u2019t yet working. That means users will have to sign in with an Apple ID. The startup says it\u2019s working to address this too.\nIt has also decided to make Beeper Mini free for the time being, given how \u201cchaotic\u201d things have been over the past few days. \u201cAs soon as things stabilize (we hope they will), we\u2019ll look at turning on subscriptions again,\u201d the blog post reads.\nAlthough Beeper did not have its app reviewed by an independent third-party security firm before launch, it\u2019s challenging Apple to put it to the test.\n\u201cIf Apple doubts the security and privacy of our app, we\u2019re willing to share the entire Beeper Mini codebase with a mutually agreed upon 3rd party security research firm,\u201d the blog post stated. Asked if they would run an audit without Apple\u2019s participation, Migicovsky tells us he wants Apple to agree on the firm first. The company also said it would be willing to add a pager emoji to metadata on all its sent messages, which would allow the Messages app to filter out messages from Beeper Mini users.\nUsers can get the updated version of Beeper Mini from beeper.com\/update on their phone for the time being as the company has not yet submitted the new version to the Play Store, claiming it needs to do some final testing. But that means users are being asked to sideload the app update onto their devices, which is riskier than downloading from the Play Store, where apps undergo reviews and basic security checks. The app update is now live on Google Play (updated, 1:28 pm ET).\nThe update, which now prompts users to sign in with their Apple ID, also includes new features, like chats that will open at the last unread message and an improved video player, the blog post noted. In tests, signing in with our Apple ID generated an Apple prompt that noted our ID was being used to sign in with a device \u201cnear Los Angeles, CA\u201d (where we are not located.) We received an error message \u201c2FA submission error\u201d after updating the app, but an uninstall\/reinstall fixed this. We understand this is a known bug.\nAfter setting up the new Beeper Mini, a message appeared on our iPhone that said: \u201cDevice Added to Your Account. A Mac now has access to iMessage,\u201d which offers a hint as to Beeper\u2019s fix.\nApple has not yet gotten in touch directly with Beeper, having only released a statement to the press. It\u2019s unclear at this time if, how, or when it will be able to disable Beeper\u2019s updated build.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-11 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":402}
{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and others","context":"## Know the price-matching policies for Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and others\n\nNothing is more frustrating than buying a new pair of headphones, an OLED TV, or a backpack just to find out that you could have gotten it for a lot cheaper somewhere else. In order to keep customers happy \u2014 and prevent them from going elsewhere \u2014 many retailers offer price-matching policies where they promise to match a lower price you\u2019ve found elsewhere. That\u2019s information that could come in handy now that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are just around the corner.\nWhat follows are the price-matching policies for a variety of major retailers. There are a few things to make note of here. First, all price-matching policies have a number of rules attached to them. We\u2019ve summarized some of the rules here, but you\u2019d be advised to go to the links that we\u2019ve provided and read the policy carefully. Second, and logically enough, retailers that serve as marketplaces for other sellers, such as Costco, don\u2019t have price-matching policies.\nLastly, there are always exceptions to the rules. If you\u2019re looking for a deal on a product and you know it\u2019s available for a lower price elsewhere (or it was previously offered at the same retailer), it never hurts to call or chat with a customer service rep and ask if they\u2019ll match the price. After all, what do you have to lose?\nIf Best Buy offers a better discount than Target on the latest Kindle Paperwhite, Target will refund you the difference. Photo by Chaim Gartenberg \/ The Verge\nAmazon doesn\u2019t offer price matching. Full stop. You can contact customer support, but even if you\u2019re an Amazon Prime customer, they\u2019re not likely going to help you out.\nThat said, Amazon does offer a pretty liberal return policy, meaning you can often return an item you purchased from Amazon if it\u2019s available for less elsewhere (or at Amazon). Then, you can just repurchase the product wherever it\u2019s cheapest.\nAs of October 22nd, Target will match the price of any item purchased online or in-store from Target that goes on sale through December 24th. However, the current price-matching policy doesn\u2019t apply to products you may have bought from one Target store and found for less at another.\nTarget will also match the price of items purchased from Amazon, Best Buy, and a select group of competitors if you ask for it at the time of or within 14 days of your purchase. You must bring the original ad or listing, whether digital or in print, along with your receipt into the store. Alternatively, you can call for online purchases at 1-800-591-3869 or chat online via contactus.target.com.\nBe mindful, however, that Target\u2019s policy excludes doorbusters and competitors\u2019 lightning sales, like those that Amazon offers. It also doesn\u2019t apply to products that require that you log in to see the price, \u201cMarketplace\u201d items from third-party sellers, or lower-priced items purchased from other Target stores.\nBest Buy\u2019s Price Match Guarantee states that a product could be eligible for a price reduction if it\u2019s new, identical to the competitor\u2019s product, immediately available at a qualifying competitor\u2019s store or on its site, and not shown on Best Buy\u2019s exclusion list (which includes \u201citems for sale the Friday before Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving\u201d).\nTo get the difference, you have to contact Best Buy via its on-site chat and be able to show the ad or website with a lower price point. Alternatively, you can call 1-888-237-8289 or visit any Best Buy or Pacific Sales store.\nBest Buy will also, upon request, match an in-store or online price that was lowered during the return and exchange period, which typically lasts up to 15 days.\nWalmart doesn\u2019t price-match the prices of its competitors, though Walmart\u2019s online store offers price-matching on items purchased from Walmart stores if the item is in stock at Walmart.com.\nHowever, the policy doesn\u2019t apply to those who live in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico. Additionally, it doesn\u2019t apply to special event prices, like those seen during Black Friday. Walmart also does not retroactively price-match items bought from Walmart.com that have dropped in price after the time of purchase. The retailer additionally doesn\u2019t price-match items purchased from Walmart Marketplace retailers or third-party sellers.\nApple doesn\u2019t offer a price-matching policy, though you can price-match on devices like the 15-inch MacBook Air \u2014 assuming it\u2019s on sale \u2014 elsewhere. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nWhile we\u2019ve seen some claims that Apple will price-match up to 10 percent for products bought at certain major retailers, there is no official policy on the company\u2019s website.\nApple does say that if it reduces its price on an Apple-branded product within 14 days from when you received your item, you can visit an Apple Store or contact the Apple Contact Center at 1-800-676-2775 to request a refund or get credit for the price difference. However, that doesn\u2019t apply to special sales like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.\nB&H says that it might be able to honor a current lower price or match the price of a competitor, but it does so on a case-by-case basis. You have to contact its Customer Service team using the on-site chat, email, or by calling 800-606-6969 \/ 212-444-6615.\nCostco does not price-match with competitors. However, according to the website, it will issue a credit for the difference between the price a member has paid and a promotional price if you bought the item online at Costco and requested the credit up to 30 days before the change in price. If you bought the product from a Costco warehouse location, visit the membership counter at the store where you made the purchase. Costco doesn\u2019t price-match items bought from Costco warehouses with Costco.com purchases.\nDell will price-match identical products from Dell, Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, HP, Apple, Lenovo, and a number of other retailers. You can call 1-877-275-3355 or chat online to run a price check, but you\u2019ll need to provide a link to the competitor\u2019s product.\nYou can also contact the company about a price difference within 30 days of purchase. However, there is a long list of restrictions, and none of this is available between Thanksgiving Day and the Monday following Thanksgiving (or on Green Monday).\nAs a general rule, eBay doesn\u2019t match the prices of purchases made during the weeks of Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. It does, however, offer a generous price-matching policy for items bought before or after that time period. If you find a lower price from a qualifying competitor on an eBay Deal item that you bought within 48 hours \u2014 or on another product with the \u201cBest Price Guarantee\u201d symbol attached to it \u2014 you\u2019ll get \u201c110 percent\u201d of the difference. That means eBay will give you an eBay coupon for the difference in price between what you bought the item for and what the competitor is selling it for, plus an additional 10 percent of that price difference. Note, however, that these coupons will expire within 30 days of being issued.\nThe products must be new, unopened, and identical to the competitor\u2019s item. You have to contact eBay Customer Service, and if they verify your claims are legitimate, you will receive the coupon and be able to use it toward your next eBay purchase.\nGameStop does not mention an official price-matching policy on its website. Last year, however, GameStop tweeted that the store will price-match items sold and shipped by Amazon as long as they\u2019re available online or in-store. Although GameStop only mentioned Amazon in the tweet, others have reported that the store will price-match items purchased from Target and elsewhere.\nGoogle will match online pricing from select retailers \u2014 specifically Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, B&H Photo, and Target \u2014 if a request is made within the standard return period. It doesn\u2019t, however, match preorder pricing from other retailers or carrier deals. The product also must be identical, right down to the color and configuration, and must be in stock. Plus, you need to provide a public link to the promo page or product listing to verify the rival\u2019s price.\nYou may also get the difference if a product purchased from the Google Store lowers in price within the standard return period. To get the price match or correction, contact Google.\nThe Home Depot will match the price of identical, in-stock products from other retailers, except for membership-based wholesalers. The price-match policy does not apply to special events like Black Friday, though, and you must bring the ad or listing with you in-store to the register. Additionally, The Home Depot will only honor requests submitted by the original buyer \u2014 no friends or family allowed.\nYou could potentially buy HP\u2019s Spectre x360 14 at a lower price thanks to HP\u2019s price-matching policy. Image: Monica Chin \/ The Verge\nAccording to HP\u2019s website, the company will match the current pre-tax price for new comparable PCs and identical HP printer, display, and accessory model numbers from nationally recognized online retailers, such as Dell, Amazon, Newegg, and Best Buy. The specs have to be the same, but the product model number does not need to be identical for computers. You have to ask for the match at the time of purchase by calling 1-800-888-0229. You can\u2019t request a price match via email or chat, though, and the policy does not extend to items bought during promotional periods. It also doesn\u2019t apply to membership stores like Costco and Sam\u2019s Club.\nIf you find a comparable product at a lower price during the return period, you can email HP at myhpsales@hp.com. This only applies to branded HP products and doesn\u2019t apply to products purchased during certain promotional events. This includes Green Monday and products on sale during the week of Thanksgiving and the week after.\nLenovo matches pricing on comparable PCs from Lenovo, HP, or Dell with the same key specs as long as they\u2019re sold through a list of recognized retailers. The comparable PC must also be in stock and readily available from both Lenovo and the competing retailer, and you have to contact a Lenovo sales rep in order to facilitate the match.\nThat said, you can\u2019t take advantage of coupons or special discounts while receiving a price match, and the policy doesn\u2019t apply to membership stores like Costco. The policy also doesn\u2019t apply to \u201cMarketplace\u201d items where third parties fulfill the order, so double-check that you bought the product directly from the retailer.\nLenovo also offers a price guarantee refund for laptops and personal desktop computers bought from Lenovo.com within 30 days of purchase. To receive a refund, you must contact Customer Care and show the lower price of the identical product offered on Lenovo.com. This policy doesn\u2019t apply to doorbuster or clearance products, however.\nLowe\u2019s will match the price of identical, in-stock products when you present an ad, product listing, or photo from a qualifying online or local retailer, including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. The product must be purchased directly from the retailer and not a third-party seller, however, and it doesn\u2019t apply to special sales like Black Friday and other various holiday promotions. Lowe\u2019s also doesn\u2019t match prices from one Lowe\u2019s store to another. To request a price match, head to the store, call 1-877-465-6937, or chat online.\nIf Microsoft lowers the price of the Xbox Series X, Microsoft could refund you the difference. Photo by Vjeran Pavic \/ The Verge\nNow through January 31st, Microsoft will refund you the difference if it drops the price of a physical product purchased online from the Microsoft Store. The same policy also applies if you find the product on sale at a lower price at a qualifying retailer, such as Amazon or Best Buy.\nYou can contact Microsoft\u2019s Sales and Support team at 1-877-696-7786 to get a refund. If you purchase an item from a Microsoft Experience Center, you\u2019ll have to go back to that location with your receipt.\nNewegg offers price matching on select items; these products are identified by the label \u201cPrice Match Guarantee\u201d that appears in the price box on the right side of the product page. This applies whether you find that lower price on Newegg or at what Newegg judges to be a major retailer. Regardless, you need to notify Newegg of the lower price within 14 days of purchase. You\u2019ll then be issued a credit you can use on the Newegg website, though you\u2019ll only have 90 days to do so.\nNewegg\u2019s price-match guarantee is not valid during major holiday sales events, including Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Green Monday.\n\nThis article, authored by Barbara Krasnoff, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-25 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":403}
{"title":"The best Black Friday headphone deals from Sony, Apple, Bose, Beats and more","context":"## The best Black Friday headphone deals from Sony, Apple, Bose, Beats and more\n\nEngadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nBlack Friday is often a boon for deals on headphones and earbuds, and this year is no different. The shopping holiday has brought a plethora of deals on all kinds of headphones, include several top picks from our guides to the best wireless headphones, wireless earbuds, budget wireless earbuds and gaming headsets. Other popular models from the likes of Sony, Beats, Bose and Apple are discounted as well. All of this means it's an ideal time to pick up a new set, whether it's to give as a gift to someone on your holiday shopping list or just to replace your own aging cans. To help you get a good bargain, we've rounded up the best Black Friday deals on headphones and earbuds we could find for 2023.\nSony WH-1000XM5\nPhoto by Billy Steele \/ Engadget Sony WH-1000XM5 $328 $400 Save $72 Black Friday has brought the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones back down to its all-time lowest price. $328 at Amazon\nThe Sony WH-1000XM5 is down to $328 at Amazon, B&H and other retailers, which is a $72 drop and ties the lowest price we\u2019ve seen. This is the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones, and we gave it a review score of 95 last year. Its active noise cancellation (ANC) is among the better options we\u2019ve tested, its design is comfortable to wear over extended periods and its battery lasts a solid 30 or so hours per charge. The sound goes heavy on the bass by default, which should please fans of hip-hop and pop music, but you can customize the EQ curve through Sony\u2019s app. Like many Sony headphones, it also comes with a number of useful bonus features; \u201cSpeak-to-Chat,\u201d for instance, automatically pauses your music when you start speaking.\nSony WF-1000XM5\nFor an in-ear pair, the Sony WF-1000XM5 is also on sale for $248 at Amazon, B&H and others. (Yes, Sony\u2019s headphone naming scheme is bad.) That matches the lowest price we\u2019ve seen and comes in $52 below Sony\u2019s usual list price. This set tops our list of the best wireless earbuds and earned a score of 87 in our review this past July. Like the over-ear XM5 above, it offers a host of useful features, a warm yet customizable sound, powerful ANC and a comfortably snug fit that naturally isolates a good chunk of outside noise on its own. Battery life should sit around seven to eight hours with average use.\nSony WH-1000XM4\nIf you don\u2019t want to pay up for Sony\u2019s highest-end noise-canceling headphones, Amazon, Adorama and B&H have the older Sony WH-1000XM4 down to $248 as well. While that isn\u2019t an all-time low, it\u2019s $100 off Sony\u2019s list price and a little lower than the usual sale price we\u2019ve seen over the course of the year. The XM4 delivers similar ANC and battery performance as its successor and has nearly the same feature set. Unlike the XM5, it can also fold up for easier storage. However, its mics aren\u2019t as clear for calls, it\u2019s a little bulkier (though it\u2019s still comfy) and it sounds a bit boomier out of the box. But at this price, it\u2019s still a strong value. We gave it a 94 in our review back in 2020.\nApple AirPods Pro\nApple\u2019s AirPods Pro are on sale for $190 at Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best Buy. That's $60 less than buying from Apple directly and ties an all-time low. This is the \u201cbest for iOS\u201d pick in our wireless earbuds guide thanks to its suite of helpful Apple-specific features, including hands-free access to Siri, quick pairing with iPhones and device tracking through Apple\u2019s Find My network. Effective (if not class-leading) ANC, a superb transparency mode and a pleasantly warm sound also stand out. That said, the Pro\u2019s six-hour battery life is just average and, as with any set of AirPods, you pretty much have to be a dedicated Apple fan to get the most out of it.\nThis deal applies to the latest iteration of the earphones, which come with a USB-C charging case. If you don\u2019t mind using a Lightning charging case, Walmart has the previous version on sale for a new low of $169. Either way, we gave the AirPods Pro a review score of 88 last year.\nApple AirPods (3rd-gen)\nThe third-gen AirPods are available for $140 at Amazon, Target, Best Buy and others. Typically, these wireless earbuds have retailed between $10 and $20 higher in recent months, but steeper discounts have been uncommon. We gave this pair a review score of 88 back in 2021: There are certainly better-sounding options for the money, but the third-gen AirPods sound noticeably richer than their predecessor, and their haptic touch controls are altogether more convenient. This is another open design, though, so there still isn\u2019t much in the way of deep bass or noise cancellation. Not everyone will find the wider earpieces comfortable either.\nApple AirPods (2nd Gen)\nThe second-gen AirPods are down to $80 at Amazon and Target, which isn\u2019t an all-time low but comes in roughly $20 below the pair\u2019s usual street price in recent months. These are Apple\u2019s entry-level wireless earbuds, having launched way back in 2019. They\u2019re a bit tougher to recommend these days, as their one-size-fits-all design won\u2019t fit everyone and you can get better sound quality even at this discounted rate. But if you prefer an open design that doesn\u2019t completely seal off your ear canal or just want the typical AirPods conveniences for as cheap as possible, this is at least a more acceptable price.\nApple AirPods Max\nApple\u2019s top-of-the-line headphones, the AirPods Max, are discounted to $450 at Amazon and Best Buy. That\u2019s $20 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve seen but about $30 below the pair\u2019s usual street price. Apple itself sells the headphones for $550. The AirPods Max are still overpriced for most even with this discount, but they remain undeniably premium, with top-tier ANC, a superbly balanced sound profile, a high-quality aluminum design, reliable controls and all the usual AirPods features. They\u2019re hefty, though, and their included \u201ccase\u201d is bafflingly flimsy. We gave the AirPods Max a review score of 84 in late 2020.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones\nBose\u2019s new QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are $50 off at multiple retailers, bringing the over-ear cans down to $379. Outside of a very brief drop a few weeks back that may have been a pricing error, this is the first significant discount we\u2019ve seen. Bose only released the QuietComfort Ultra last month. We gave it a score of 86 in our review, praising its predictably comfy design, outstanding ANC, above-average call quality and bassy default sound. We still recommend the Sony XM5 to most, as that pair offers a wider feature set and the ability to be used passively (i.e., without being turned on), but the QuietComfort Ultra may still be worth a look if you must have especially powerful noise cancellation.\nWe\u2019ll also note that the new, non-Ultra QuietComfort Headphones are $100 off, bringing them down to a new low of $249. We haven\u2019t reviewed this model yet, but it\u2019s the follow-up to 2021\u2019s QuietComfort 45, which we generally liked. Other reviews suggest it has a more bass-heavy sound, though, and we\u2019d expect it to be a slight step down from the Ultra across the board.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds\nThe new Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, meanwhile, are down to $249 at several stores. That's another $50 discount and an all-time low. We gave these in-ears a review score of 88 in September and recently named them the \u201cbest for noise cancellation\u201d pick in our wireless earbuds buying guide. As that title suggests, the main reason to consider this pair over the Sony WF-1000XM5 is its ANC performance, which is the strongest we\u2019ve tested from a true wireless model. We also enjoy Bose\u2019s spatial audio tech. But the earpieces are on the larger side, the call quality and battery life (at six-ish hours) are just OK and there\u2019s no support for multi-device pairing.\nBeats Fit Pro\nThe Beats Fit Pro is back down to $159, which isn\u2019t an all-time low but is still roughly $20 below its average street price. This is the \u201cbest for workouts\u201d pick in our wireless earbuds buying guide, as it packs many of the iOS-friendly conveniences of Apple\u2019s AirPods in a sportier and more stable design. It also uses physical control buttons instead of touch panels, and its punchy sound plays well with most popular music. But it can\u2019t connect to multiple devices at once, it doesn\u2019t support wireless charging and its ANC, while fine, isn\u2019t as capable as the AirPods Pro\u2019s. The Fit Pro earned a score of 87 in our review from 2021.\nBeats Studio Pro\nThe Beats Studio Pro is down to $170 for Black Friday at Amazon, Target and Best Buy. That tops the pair\u2019s previous low by $10 and falls about $130 below its average street price in recent months. The Studio Pro isn\u2019t a top pick in any of our guides, but we gave it a solid review score of 81 in July. Its sound is largely pleasant and even-handed, its ANC is strong enough to be useful and it can stream higher-quality audio if you connect over a USB-C cable. It works well with both iOS and Android, too, though it doesn\u2019t support multi-device pairing on the former. There\u2019s no auto-pausing when you remove the headphones, either, and the design is mostly made of plastic. But if you like the Beats style, those flaws should be a little easier to accept at this price.\nAmazon Echo Buds (2023)\nWe recommend the Amazon Echo Buds in our budget wireless earbuds guide to those who hate the feeling of traditional in-ear headphones. They\u2019re now down to $35 for Black Friday, a $15 drop that matches an all-time low. The Echo Buds have a semi-open design, so they let in a good amount of outside noise and can\u2019t produce deep bass, but some will find the shape preferable to a pair that sticks in their ear canals. They can sound perfectly decent with a bit of EQ tweaking, while features like multi-device pairing, wear detection and hands-free Alexa are all nice to have. However, there\u2019s no wireless charging, the battery life (five or so hours per charge) is mediocre and the IPX2 sweat-resistance rating is too weak for the gym. Amazon\u2019s companion app is rather bloated too. But those shouldn\u2019t be deal-breakers for $35. We gave the Echo Buds a review score of 77 in July.\nAnker Soundcore Space A40\nThe Anker Soundcore Space A40 is one of the best values in wireless earphones at its normal price of $79, but now it\u2019s down to $54 for Black Friday. That ties the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked. The Space A40 tops our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds because it delivers most of the features we expect from headphones that cost twice as much. It\u2019s comfortable, its ANC is genuinely capable, its battery lasts up to 10 hours per charge, its tiny case supports wireless charging and it can pair with two devices at once. Its warm sound will be pleasing enough for most by default, but it can also be customized through a clean companion app. The only major downsides are middling mic quality and a lack of auto-pausing when you remove an earbud.\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC\nThe Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC is the runner up in our budget wireless earbuds guide, as it offers a highly similar feature set as the Space A40 but comes in a larger \u201cstem\u201d design reminiscent of Apple\u2019s AirPods. It has a more bass-forward sound by default, which some may find fatiguing, but it also has slightly more extensive touch controls and technically supports wear detection. Right now the Liberty 4 NC is down to $70 at Amazon, B&H and Best Buy, which beats its previous low by $10 and falls $30 below Anker\u2019s list price. If you prefer this kind of bulkier but easier-to-remove shape, this is an excellent value.\nAnker Soundcore Space Q45\nIf you\u2019re after a wallet-friendly pair of noise-canceling over-ear headphones, Anker\u2019s Soundcore Space Q45 is worth a look at its Black Friday price of $100. For that amount, this pair\u2019s better-than-average ANC, softly padded design and multi-device pairing make for a strong value. Its V-shaped sound profile isn\u2019t especially detailed, but it can work well enough for pop music and it\u2019s customizable through Anker\u2019s app. Call quality is mediocre, however. This $50 discount matches the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked, and it's available at both Amazon and Anker's online store; just use the on-page coupon for the latter.\nAudio-Technica ATH-M20xBT\nThe Audio-Technica ATH-M20xBT is a modest $10 off for Black Friday, bringing the wireless headphones down to $69. We saw this pair fall to $55 during Amazon\u2019s Prime Day sale in July, but this is about as low as it\u2019s been outside of that. The M20 is the budget pick in our wireless headphones guide thanks to its comfortable fit, 60-hour battery life, multi-device connectivity and relatively detailed audio quality. It lacks ANC and doesn\u2019t have the sturdiest design, but it should do the job if you just need a no-frills wireless headphone for cheap.\nEarFun Free 2S\nThe EarFun Free 2S is down to $24.59 at Amazon with a Prime-only discount and the checkout code FREE2SPD1. That\u2019s an all-time low. The Free 2S is the \u201cbest under $50\u201d pick in our budget wireless earbuds guide. It has a hugely bass-forward sound out of the box, but some may enjoy that with hip-hop or EDM and the profile is customizable through the EarFun app. The earpieces are comfortable and fully waterproof, the battery lasts around seven hours, and the suite of touch controls work reliably, which isn\u2019t a given in this price range. There\u2019s no ANC, multi-device connectivity or wear detection, however, and the built-in mic will pick up wind noise if you\u2019re on a call outside.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro + $10 Amazon gift card\nThe Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are on sale for $160 for Black Friday, and you can get them with a $10 Amazon gift card for no extra cost. That\u2019s a good way from their all-time low \u2014 they very briefly fell to $105 last year \u2014 but it\u2019s still $30 or so less than their average selling price in recent months. While the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro aren\u2019t a top pick in any of our guides, they\u2019re worth a look if you use a Galaxy phone, as they can quickly pair with and swap between other Samsung devices (including TVs) and support a higher-quality audio codec on the company\u2019s handsets. More generally, this is one of the better sounding pairs of wireless earphones we\u2019ve tested, with impressive clarity and well-controlled bass, and the buds themselves are both comfortable and waterproof. You can\u2019t connect to two devices at once, however, and the five-hour battery life is poor. We gave the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro a review score of 86 last year.\nJabra Elite 3\nAnother pick from our budget wireless earbuds guide, the Jabra Elite 3, is down to $40 at Best Buy. That matches the best price we\u2019ve tracked. This pair\u2019s mildly bass-boosted sound is great for the money, and its snug, IP55-rated design is well-suited for workouts. It\u2019s a relatively basic set, though, as it lacks ANC, multi-device pairing, wireless charging and wear detection. But those omissions are easier to accept for $40. We gave the Elite 3 a score of 88 in our review from September 2021.\nJLab Go Air Pop\nThe JLab Go Air Pop is available for $17 at Amazon, which isn't an all-time low \u2014 the pair was briefly down to just $10 at Walmart earlier this week \u2014 but still takes about $6 off their usual going rate. We highlight the Go Air Pop as an honorable mention in our budget wireless earbuds guide. Its IPX4-rated design is light and generally comfortable, its battery lasts around eight or nine hours per charge and, unlike many cheap earphones, its touch controls actually work. Its boomy sound profile won\u2019t win any awards, predictably, but it\u2019s well beyond serviceable for less than $20. JLab even bakes three different EQ presets directly into the earphones. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap backup to your main wireless earphones, this is a great value.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro are available for a new low of $115 at Wellbots, which is about $50 off their average street price. Other retailers like Amazon and Best Buy have them for $5 more. We call the Pixel Buds Pro the best option for Android users in our wireless earbuds buying guide due to their tight integration with the OS (and Google\u2019s Pixel phones in particular). Their ANC and V-shaped sound are solid (if not superlative) as well, and they can last between up to 11 hours depending on how often you use the former. The fit may be tricky for those with smaller ear canals, though. We gave this pair a score of 87 in our review last year.\nBeyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X\nBeyerdynamic's DT 900 Pro X headphones are down to $249 at Amazon and Target from a trusted third-party seller. That\u2019s only $20 off their usual going rate, but we haven\u2019t seen many larger discounts over the past few months. The DT 900 Pro X is a wired pair of open-back headphones designed for critical listening at home. It\u2019s currently the top pick in our guide to the best headphones for gaming, as its wonderfully spacious sound does well to envelop you in the fine details of any given game. Like most open-back cans, it can\u2019t produce truly deep sub-bass, but it delivers enough low-end to give in-game explosions a powerful sense of impact. A set of soft velour earpads keep the whole thing comfortable, though it can\u2019t fold up, and the open design means it won\u2019t block much external noise when you\u2019re outside of the house.\nSennheiser HD 560S\nThe Sennheiser HD 560S is another open-back pair of wired headphones we highlight in our gaming headset guide. It\u2019s down to $150 at Amazon, B&H, Sennheiser\u2019s online store and other retailers \u2014 that\u2019s not an incredible deal, as the pair often sold for the same rate earlier in the year, but it\u2019s about $30 less than the street price we\u2019ve seen since the summer. Regardless, the HD 560S offers a pleasingly balanced, spacious and detailed sound profile and a frame that\u2019s comfortable to wear for extended periods. It can sometimes sound a little piercing in the treble, it\u2019s not as sturdily built as the DT 900 Pro X and, again, it\u2019ll leak and let in lots of noise. But if you want audio-centric headphones for less than $200, this is one of the better options in the price range.\nIn other Sennheiser deals, the Drop X Sennheiser HD 6XX is on sale for $169 at Drop, a $50 discount that\u2019s only $10 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked. We haven\u2019t formally reviewed this pair, but Engadget\u2019s audio expert Billy Steele gave some positive impressions in a hands-on way back in 2016, and the pair upon which it\u2019s based (the Sennheiser HD 650) has long been a favorite among audiophiles. If you\u2019d prefer an open-back pair with a little more bass warmth, it might be worth a look.\nAstro A40 TR\nOur favorite dedicated gaming headset for most people, the Astro A40 TR, is down to $100 at Amazon. That\u2019s a $30 discount. This deal bundles the headset with Astro\u2019s MixAmp M80, an optional amp that connects to Xbox controllers and provides various audio controls. Even without the accessory, we like the open-back A40 for providing a wider soundstage than most gaming headsets. It\u2019s not as open or detailed as the Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X or Sennheiser HD 560S, and it misses more detail in the treble range, but it\u2019s immersive, with a slight bass boost gives in-game effects a little extra boom. The headset as a whole looks \u201cgamer-y,\u201d but it\u2019s comfortable. And while its built-in mic isn\u2019t the clearest we\u2019ve tested, it\u2019s at least serviceable for basic chat.\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2\nIf all you want is a decent gaming headset for as little as possible, the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 is worth considering at $35. That\u2019s only $5 below its usual going rate, but it matches the lowest price we\u2019ve seen. The Cloud Stinger 2 is the budget pick in our gaming headset guide: It sounds narrower and less balanced than the Astro A40, but its built-in mic is great for the money and its bass-heavy profile at least makes action scenes feel a little more exciting. It\u2019s all comfy, too, though it\u2019s largely made of plastic.\nLogitech G535\nThe Logitech G535 is another honorable mention in our gaming headsets guide, one that should specifically appeal to those who want a wireless option for less than $100. If that\u2019s you, good news: It\u2019s available for just under $80 at Amazon, B&H and Best Buy, which is about $25 off its usual street price. The G535\u2019s noticeably light frame, relatively balanced sound and Bluetooth support all impress for the price; just note that it doesn\u2019t work with Xbox, and that its mic sounds a bit thinner than the wired headsets highlighted above. Its battery life clocks in at 30 to 35 hours per charge, which is decent but not great.\nShokz OpenRun Pro\nPhoto by Jon Turi \/ Engadget Shokz OpenRun Pro $125 $180 Save $55 If you want a pair of headphones that don't totally shut you out from the outside world, the bone-conducting Shokz OpenRun Pro are worth a look. $125 at Amazon\nThe Shokz OpenRun Pro is back down to $125 for Black Friday, which is $25 more than its all-time low but $55 less than its usual street price. These are bone conduction headphones, which means they go around the side of your head and deliver sound via vibrations to your skull. If you want to listen to music and podcasts without totally blocking the outside world, they might make sense. The flipsides are that they\u2019re harder to use in noisier areas and, generally speaking, not as full-sounding as traditional in-ear headphones. Engadget Editor Jon Turi found this pair to deliver more low-end depth than most of its peers, however.

{"title":"Kick streamers consider leaving over CEO\u2019s comments in a sex worker \u2018prank\u2019 stream","context":"## Kick streamers consider leaving over CEO\u2019s comments in a sex worker \u2018prank\u2019 stream\n\nKick streamers consider leaving over CEO\u2019s comments in a sex worker \u2018prank\u2019 stream With little moderation, many question if Kick is safe. Others can't afford to stop streaming.\nStreamers are leaving Kick en masse in protest of the platform\u2019s lack of safety guidelines, after a prominent creator streamed an encounter with a sex worker without informing her that there were other people present. She was briefly prevented from leaving after she expressed discomfort, while Kick\u2019s CEO posted laughing emotes in the stream chat.\n\u201cIt sucks to see a platform stand behind someone who clearly doesn\u2019t respect sex workers or their safety,\u201d Rachel, a streamer known as TheFoodieWaifu, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis was a job for her and to them a game. This woman clearly was afraid and was just trying to work and be safe.\u201d\nPaul Denino, a creator also known as Ice Poseidon, streamed the encounter on September 21. The interactions with the sex worker took place in a living room, while Denino and fellow streamer Sam Pepper hid in an adjacent bedroom. The stream shows another man, named Andy, paying the sex worker $500 and asking for her consent to film. When the encounter became physical, Denino and Pepper made noises behind the door, which startled the woman. She tried to leave after receiving a text about the people in the other room, but Andy stopped her. When Andy reminded her that he had already paid her, she said the encounter was \u201ccreepy.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is it creepy?\u201d Andy said. \u201cIt\u2019s you and me and no one else.\u201d\nIn a post days later, Denino disputed claims of a \u201chidden camera\u201d and alleged that the interaction was legal. Denino streamed from Brisbane, Australia, where sex work is legal in licensed brothels or if a sex worker is working in private and alone. He also posted footage of a call allegedly asking the sex worker he could film her, which she approved for an extra fee. Later in the clip, he tells Andy that he can\u2019t block the sex worker from leaving.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the mention that you two were hiding in the room? Creepy as fuck,\u201d Repzion, another creator who streams on Kick, replied. \u201cDid she consent to that? When she found that out, she left because she was uncomfortable. It\u2019s shitty regardless.\u201d\nKick has lured disenchanted Twitch streamers away from the platform with non-exclusive streaming deals, light moderation and a coveted 95\/5 revenue split. The platform is young, but its first year has been checkered with controversy \u2014 starting with its ties to a crypto gambling site also owned by Kick CEO Eddie Craven. The most recent scandal is a wake-up call for many of its streamers \u2014 especially women who question if the platform is safe for them at all.\nThe platform addressed the incident in a public post earlier this week, affirming that community and public safety \u201ccannot be compromised\u201d in content creation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuously learning where this balance sits and are making changes daily,\u201d the post continued. \u201cWe appreciate our community for the continuous feedback, both the good & the bad. We\u2019ll keep you updated on upcoming changes to community guidelines and subsequent enforcement measures.\u201d\nKick did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment. In a statement to 404 Media, the company said that they \u201ccontinuously review and refine\u201d its policies, but may not disclose specific details \u201cfor privacy and confidentiality reasons.\u201d\n\u201cWe aim to maintain a fair and consistent approach to content moderation while respecting the privacy of our users and employees,\u201d the statement said.\nThe company also removed Denino from the front page and featured category, which Bree, another Kick streamer, described as a \u201cstart.\u201d Returning to Twitch isn\u2019t an option for her, she said, because of the harassment she faced on the platform.\n\u201cKick\u2019s decision not to ban him does hurt, but I do think that from a business standpoint with contracts involved you can\u2019t just ban someone,\u201d she said in a DM. \u201cI feel like a lot of people are focusing on this while our time could be better spent working together to make our platform better.\u201d\nSo many people will say \u201coh go back to twitch\u201d\u2026 I can\u2019t. That platform let creators openly harass, bully, abuse, oppress and threaten my life multiple times. I don\u2019t feel safe there and I never will. I\u2019m stuck rn. This is my livelihood and how I keep a roof over my head. \u2014 Bree (@KickBree) September 24, 2023\nKick\u2019s pallid response infuriated both streamers and viewers. Bob, a creator known as BobDuckNWeave, described the incident as \u201cjust sickening\u201d and criticized the platform\u2019s \u201cnon-response.\u201d\n\u201cI understand consent was in fact given by the woman on stream, but the premise alone was bad enough for a site seemingly focused on gaming\/creative content,\u201d he said over DM.\nHe is one of many streamers who vowed to leave the platform in the aftermath of the incident.\nIn a thread announcing his departure, he apologized for his association with the platform, and told TechCrunch that he thought it would get better.\nBob acknowledged that the platform has had a string of controversies in its short existence \u2014 most recently, an offensive fake interview between white supremacist sympathizer Adin Ross, accused sex trafficker Andrew Tate and a Kim Jong Un impersonator \u2014 and that seeing Craven laughing at the sex worker was \u201cmore than enough to stamp out any hope that the platform intends to improve any of its policies.\u201d\nRachel, who also makes cooking videos on YouTube, also decided to leave Kick despite the opportunities it gave her as a smaller creator. She started streaming on the platform because she was burning out on Twitch, and believed that Kick would figure out stronger moderation with time.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand behind a platform that thinks it\u2019s OK to view people as objects,\u201d she said in a DM. \u201cI am not saying if folks choose to stay on the platform that they are for encouraging this behavior. I am saying that for me, I can no longer say I stream on Kick. This will be a [financial] hit most definitely, not as much for some bigger streamers, but still enough to feel it with inflation being at its highest right now.\u201d\nBut others can\u2019t afford to take the hit, and can\u2019t rely on Twitch alone to pay their bills.\nThe default sub (subscription) revenue split for Partners is 50\/50, but select streamers were offered a premium 70\/30 deal until last year. Twitch cut that deal in favor of the platform\u2019s ad revenue program, which angered many of its most loyal creators. Partners grandfathered into the agreement were still paid a 70% cut of the first $100,000 they earned, and 50% of any revenue after that.\nThe platform rolled out a new Partner Plus program this year, which allowed qualifying streamers to apply for the same deal given to streamers grandfathered into the 70\/30 split. The steep requirements excludes the majority of Twitch Partners and doesn\u2019t count gifted subs toward the minimum subscription requirement, further straining the relationship between the platform and its creators. Although Twitch adjusted the program so that higher tier subscriptions count for more points toward the minimum subscription requirement, it wasn\u2019t the change that streamers were requesting.\nKelly, a streamer known as MrsViolence, joined Twitch when it was still operating as Justin.tv. She began streaming full time when she had to step away from her esports coaching and hosting career for her health. Like many streamers who joined Twitch before its explosive pandemic growth, Kelly was offered a 70\/30 revenue split. About a year ago, before Twitch axed the premium revenue deal, Kelly\u2019s Twitch income was a little over $1,000 per month (up to $1,200 on a \u201creally good month\u201d) with over 700 paying subscribers. She supplemented her income with tips and OnlyFans subscriptions.\nWhen the revenue split changes went into effect earlier this year, Kelly\u2019s monthly income fell to about $400. Since she stopped prioritizing her Twitch channel, her monthly Twitch income hovers around $120. That prompted her to start streaming on Kick, where she said she makes over $1,000 per month with only 145 subscribers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s covering all of my rent and groceries and then like a night out with my boyfriend,\u201d Kelly said in a call with TechCrunch. \u201cSo I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s run by some gambling, underground Dark Web loser. It\u2019s making people money and it\u2019s helping them in the worst economic depression we have ever seen.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say that Ice Poseidon\u2019s stream didn\u2019t affect her.\n\u201cI broke down in tears,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was like, now I\u2019m part of this website that has pieces of shit running fucking wild and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it, and I refuse to go back and make pennies on Twitch.\u201d\nAs a creator who\u2019s been working in the games industry for more than a decade, Kelly said she\u2019ll continue making content wherever she can make money, because her chronic health conditions prevent her from returning to in-person hosting and coaching. She experienced \u201cjust as much abuse\u201d as a woman on Twitch, and isn\u2019t optimistic about other livestreaming platforms like Rumble or YouTube. Kelly added that in its early days, Twitch was just as unmoderated and violently misogynistic as parts of Kick are today. The streaming community can\u2019t rely on platforms to operate in the best interest of their creators, she said, and instead has to hope that local governments will step in to regulate safety.\n\u201cI feel very small. There\u2019s nothing we can do and it\u2019s a fight that I think too many people are investing their lives in, and changing their careers over, their money, their income, because of something you can\u2019t change,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI\u2019m very numb. Desensitized is a great word. I feel for people, I get it. But at the same time I got to survive in this dumb world. Like, gas is up again!\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Morgan Sung, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-09-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":405}

The ball was hot, the ball was moving and everybody contributed today.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSydney only had themselves to blame for the loss as they went 10-of-37 from three-point range.\nJaylen Adams (18 points, 10 rebounds) and Jordan Hunter (16, five) couldn\u2019t lift the Kings over the line.\n\u201cSometimes you just miss shots,\u201d Kings coach Mahmoud Abdelfattah said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been practising these for the last two-and-a-half months, we got some great looks and at the end of the day that\u2019s the difference.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re missing a ton of shots you\u2019ve got to win the offensive rebounding battle and they beat us on that.\u201d\nTasmania burst out to a double-figure lead when they piled on 36 points during the opening period, and the margin blew out to 18 before halftime.\nDoyle (12 points), Deng and Jack McVeigh (both 10) all did plenty of damage on the scoreboard in the first half for the visitors, who never trailed. Galloway\u2019s huge dunk sparked Sydney early in the third period and they cut the margin to three.\nAdvertisement\nBut he and Bolden soon exited and Crawford\u2019s scintillating run gave the JackJumpers the upper hand. The Kings are hopeful Galloway will be fit for Saturday\u2019s trip to take on the Cairns Taipans.\n\u201cThe doctors may have other plans, but he\u2019s doing alright,\u201d Abdelfattah said. \u201cObviously he was out for the rest of the game and he\u2019s in pain a little bit, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nGoulding\u2019s golden touch too much for Breakers\nVeteran shooter Chris Goulding has fired a series of clutch three-pointers to pilot NBL ladder leaders Melbourne United to a 97-88 win over New Zealand.\nGoulding had a quiet first half but drove daggers into the visitors at John Cain Arena on Sunday when he found range after the main break.\nIn his 300th game for Melbourne, Goulding delivered his trademark when he twice launched crucial bombs to help his team edge ahead in the dying stages of a tight contest.\nGoulding\u2019s fade-away from the corner gave United a game-high nine-point lead with three minutes left as he finished with 4-of-5 shooting from distance.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe can\u2019t not talk about CG\u2019s couple of threes down the stretch,\u201d coach Dean Vickerman told reporters post-game. \u201cThey were pretty incredible.\u201d\nJo Lual-Acuil (16 points) and import Ian Clark (18) also came up with big plays in the final period as Melbourne outscored their opponents 33-25 with the game on the line.\nLual-Acuil shone in his second game back from a long-term wrist injury, and Clark\u2019s wide-open three restored United\u2019s nine-point buffer with 38 seconds left to play. Such was Goulding\u2019s confidence in his teammate, he turned around to celebrate the game-sealing bucket with the home crowd before Clark had even released his shot.\nMelbourne had five scorers in double figures in an even team performance in the absence of injured guard Matthew Dellavedova, who has missed two games because of his latest concussion setback.\nThe result was Melbourne\u2019s ninth consecutive home win over New Zealand and gave them a 6-1 record for the season.\nThe Breakers (1-2) led by six points midway through the third period but ran out of steam in a tough loss that ended a gruelling road trip, which included two exhibition matches against NBA opposition in the United States.\nAdvertisement\nZylan Cheatham (30 points) and Parker Jackson-Cartwright (18) threatened to drive the Breakers to a rousing victory until the guard fouled out inside the last four minutes.\nFormer NBA forward Anthony Lamb had 15 points and five rebounds on his NBL debut for New Zealand after signing as a replacement for injured import Justinian Jessup.\nBut Breakers coach Mody Maor was in no mood to look for positives in his team\u2019s performance.\n\u201cWe have very high standards for how we want to play and this isn\u2019t it,\u201d Maor said. \u201cLack of focus, missing key players, making mistakes on covers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care where we flew from, what our schedule is, what happened the day before \u2013 I care zero. This isn\u2019t the level of execution that we expect from ourselves.\u201d\nShea Ili (16 points, four assists) was important for Melbourne and Luke Travers finished with 16 points, including 15 in the first half.\nSixers, Phoenix continue to rise\nAdvertisement\nThe Adelaide 36ers have told each other some hard truths before responding in style to heap more pressure on the Perth Wildcats with their 89-78 victory.\nIn the other NBL match on Saturday, South East Melbourne Phoenix made it three straight wins, beating the Bullets 96-73 as Alan Williams led the way against a side looking lost without the suspended Aron Baynes.\nIn Adelaide, the 36ers responded to a disappointing loss on Thursday night, also at home to the Phoenix, and handed the Wildcats a third straight defeat with their 11-point win.\nSitting in bottom spot with one win from five games coming into the macth, the players got together to draw a line in the sand.\nIt certainly worked and their effort, energy and desperation was dramatically improved against Perth, but so was the execution and a focus on getting Isaac Humphries more involved inside.\nHe put up 26 points and eight rebounds in a match-winning performance but the shortening of the rotation to use just eight players from coach CJ Bruton worked too.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe met as a playing group yesterday and talked through a lot of stuff,\u201d Humphries said.\n\u201cWe just wanted to come out today and put into action everything we talked about.\n\u201cWe executed what the coaches needed from us tonight and we executed what we, as a playing group, wanted to execute as well.\u201d\nA third straight defeat for the Wildcats has them struggling at 2-4 this season.\nCoach John Rillie is focused know they aren\u2019t playing well and the improvement needs to start offensively.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing good basketball at this point in time,\u201d Rillie said.\n\u201cAn area we need to improve on is our offence. That\u2019s where we have to find some type of rhythm and we\u2019ve yet to do that in these last couple of games.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe game\u2019s played at both ends and you need to find a rhythm to generate some natural enthusiasm, and we haven\u2019t been able to do that for good stretches.\u201d\nBrisbane coach Justin Schueller always knew losing his superstar centre Baynes with a five-game suspension was going to be challenging, but that was magnified on Saturday night.\nWilliams produced 21 points and six rebounds for South East Melbourne but Brisbane will still be without Baynes for next weekend\u2019s double-header away to Perth and at home to Tasmania, and he needs to find some answers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have solutions right now for two more games without Banger (Baynes) and that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s sitting right in the front of my head, but scoring 73 points isn\u2019t enough to get it done in this league,\u201d Schueller said.\n\u201cThen giving them 96 is way too many as well so we have a lot of stuff that we still have to work on.\u201d\nJLA return lifts United to win in Wollongong\nAdvertisement\nMelbourne United have celebrated the long-awaited return of Jo Lual-Acuil but it was fellow centre Ariel Hukporti who starred in a 101-91 defeat of the lllawarra Hawks.\nNBL heavyweights United only kicked clear from last season\u2019s wooden spooners towards the end of the third quarter following a high-scoring first half at WIN Entertainment Centre on Friday.\nAgain sloppy from the field, the Hawks missed nine consecutive shots to finish the third period as United (5-1) opened up a 14-point lead that proved match-winning.\n\u201cWe just have these patches against really good basketball teams that let us down,\u201d said Hawks coach Jacob Jackomas.\n\u201cThe shots weren\u2019t disgusting today, just some little things right now. We said that before with the team is that we need to do all the little things right against this basketball team and we didn\u2019t.\u201d\nBig man Gary Clark (17 points) was one of few Hawks who got his eye in, with imports Tyler Harvey (19 points, six from 16 attempts) and Justin Robinson (nine points, two from eight) again struggling.\nRobinson was one of three Hawks to foul out, alongside big men Sam Froling and Lachlan Olbrich.\nAdvertisement\nDespite Illawarra\u2019s shooting issues, United gave up more first half points (51) than in any other of their games this season.\nThe Hawks dominated the offensive glass (18-10) and punished United with 21 points from turnovers.\nBut they finished the day shooting at 38 per cent from the field to United\u2019s 53, which made things difficult, especially when United locked the paint down in the third quarter.\n\u201cIt took us a little bit of time to wake up with their physicality and the way they got after it,\u201d said United coach Dean Vickerman.\nNBL champion Lual-Acuil returned from a wrist injury for the first minutes of his United comeback, while NBA hopeful Hukporti (21 points, 10 rebounds) shone for the visitors.\nHukporti was United\u2019s rock under the basket and a defensive board in the final minute sealed his third double-double from five games this season.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve found my role in the team now, it took me a while because I\u2019m coming off the (achilles) injury and it was a year out,\u201d Hukporti said.\nThat is vintage Tyler Harvey ????\n\nCan he pull the Hawks back into this one?\n\nCatch the last quarter live on ESPN via Kayo ???? pic.twitter.com\/40zoswVyPh \u2014 NBL (@NBL) October 20, 2023\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it now, I know what my role is and I think I did a great job today.\u201d\nLual-Acuil had a scratchy start, missing his first two free-throws and subbing out to change out of an incorrect pair of shorts, but went on to register 12 points on a minutes restriction.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to see double-teams down there so once we get our spacing right and our cutting right to play off that, he\u2019s going to be a weapon,\u201d Vickerman said.\nProjected NBA draft lottery pick AJ Johnson had his best Hawks game yet, but was again short on opportunities.\nThe teenager set the crowd alight with his first NBL three-pointer just after quarter time and sent a dime through traffic that led to a Gary Clark jam on transition soon afterwards.\nAdvertisement\nCreek swamps Sixers for Phoenix\nA powerful second quarter propelled South East Melbourne Phoenix to a clinical 102-85 NBL victory against the Adelaide 36ers at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre.\nThe Phoenix pummelled the Sixers 28-14 in the second term on Thursday night to put the game out of the home side\u2019s reach.\nMitch Creek (23 points) led the Phoenix\u2019s charge, import guards Gary Browne (19 points, eight assists) and Will Cummings (18 points) did as they pleased, while Alan Williams (15 points, 13 rebounds) was influential in his first game of the season following a knee injury.\n\u201cWe were trading baskets until that second five minutes of the second quarter when the guys got multiple stops in a row and kept scoring freely,\u201d Phoenix coach Mike Kelly said.\n\u201cThat was the difference right there, that five-minute patch.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nImport Trey Kell (21 points) top-scored for Adelaide, while Dejan Vasiljevic, signed by the 36ers from the Sydney Kings only 48 hours earlier, had 17 points on debut with his new club.\nVasiljevic was prolific early, firing 10 attempts and scoring 10 points in the first quarter.\nAt the other end, Browne racked up nine points and four assists in the opening period, which ended with scores tied at 28-28.\nVasiljevic\u2019s third triple gave Adelaide a slender 40-39 lead, before the visitors rattled off the next 15 points and led 54-42 at half-time.\nAfter Browne led Phoenix\u2019s early charge, it was fellow imports Williams and Cummings who, in the second stanza, troubled the Sixers, who looked all at sea offensively and passive defensively.\nAfter Phoenix\u2019s lead ballooned to 17 points midway through the third, experienced 36ers reserves Sunday Dech and Jason Cadee helped the home side briefly trim the deficit to single digits.\nAdvertisement\nBut their hard work was undone when Creek, who helped himself to 13 points for the term, drained an uncontested three on the three-quarter-time buzzer to push Phoenix out to 77-65, before Williams and Browne continued on their merry way in the fourth.\n\u201cDisappointing \u2013 that\u2019s what that was,\u201d Sixers coach CJ Bruton said.\n\u201cOur effort left, our communication left, and everyone was a step too slow.\u201d\nThe Phoenix rose to 3-3 with their second straight win, while Adelaide (1-5) remain anchored to the bottom of the ladder.\nCJ claims Kings didn\u2019t look after DJ\nAdelaide coach CJ Bruton has accused Sydney of not looking after Dejan Vasiljevic, as the war of words between the 36ers and Kings over the sharpshooting guard escalated.\nVasiljevic, a two-time championship winner with Sydney, had originally been released from his Kings contract to chase his NBA dream.\nAdvertisement\nBut when the Washington Wizards waived him just before pre-season training camp, the 26-year-old decided to return to the NBL \u2013 signing with the Sixers on Tuesday, which didn\u2019t please Sydney\u2019s powerbrokers.\n\u201cWe originally amended the contract in good faith and completed our roster with the understanding that \u2018DJ\u2019 (Vasiljevic) would play internationally this season,\u201d Kings chief executive Chris Pongrass said.\n\u201cWe are disappointed with how this has been handled and another NBL team\u2019s role in this process.\u201d\nAustralian basketball legend and Kings co-owner Andrew Bogut chimed in on X where he posted, in part, that Sydney had granted Vasiljevic a release \u201cafter he told us he wanted to \u2018chase his NBA dream\u2019, not his NBL dream with another club\u201d.\nVasiljevic, fronting the press as a 36er for the first time on Wednesday, fired back at the Kings, saying \u201cthey made me look like a villain, they made Adelaide look like the villain\u201d.\nBut on Thursday night, Bruton called for Sydney to \u201cmove on\u201d.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019ve only got my perspective \u2013 you (Kings) had the chance to have him, you chose not to have him,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s moved on. Move on.\n\u201cIf you wanted to do something more, look after the kid.\n\u201cTalk to him, championship ceremony or whatever \u2026 but that\u2019s on them (Sydney).\n\u201cThat\u2019s not on us or me.\u201d\nVasiljevic scored 17 points in his Adelaide debut on Thursday, including 11 in a productive first quarter, but he couldn\u2019t prevent the bottom-placed Sixers from suffering a 102-85 loss to South East Melbourne Phoenix.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI thought his energy was good,\u201d Bruton said of his prized recruit.\n\u201cWith more time to settle in, the better he\u2019ll become.\u201d\n\u00a9 AAP\n\nThis article, authored by The Roar, was published by The Roar | Sports Writers Blog on 2023-10-19 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":406}

He refused to answer a question on potential break clauses in his contract with RA.\nAdvertisement\nOn whether he will see out his contract through the end of 2027, Jones said: \u201cIt\u2019s not absolutely my decision. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a review going forward and let\u2019s see what happens at the end of the review.\nHe said he was not worried about being sacked but accepted it was possible.\n\u201cI don\u2019t control those sort of things. All I can do is coach. I went to the World Cup, came in for a short period of time and had to make a decision on the team, made the decision we needed to go with youth, and whilst the results in the World Cup weren\u2019t the results we wanted, I think I\u2019ve left the Australian team in a great position to go on to 2027.\n\u201cThat judgment will be decided by the 2027 World Cup.\u201d\nHe said the team \u2013 including coaches and players \u2013 have already completed their own review of the World Cup disaster. The next one would be \u201ca formal review to be done by independent consultants\u201d and he was ready to participate.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come back to Australia to have a holiday \u2013 sit down at Coogee Beach, eat fish and chips, have a nice flat white. It was always going to be a battle. When you\u2019ve got a team that hasn\u2019t done well for a long period of time, it\u2019s always a battle.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nJones said it was crucial that Rugby Australia got alignment in the code from grassroots through to the top team as it looks to rebuild it\u2019s international standing. Australia, a two-time world champion, is currently ranked 10th in the world.\n\u201cYou just got to watch the quarterfinals at the weekend. We\u2019re not at that level. And we can\u2019t pretend to be at that level. But can we be at that level by 2027? Yes, we can,\u201d said Jones.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely off the pace but the opportunity to get better is there. I love the game. I love working with young players. I loved seeing some of the young players maturing during the World Cup and some of them struggle. And that\u2019s all part of it. But I love the game and I love coaching the Wallabies.\u201d\nJones was named Wallabies coach at the start of the year as replacement for Dave Rennie. He came in with grand statements that his team could win the Rugby Championship, Bledisloe Cup and make a smash and grab on the World Cup.\nNone of those targets were achieved and Jones changed his tune about building for the future when he named a young team for the doomed Cup campaign \u2013 where his team became the first Australians to bow out of a RWC in the pool stages.\nHe finished the year with a 2-7 win loss record \u2013 the only two victories coming against lowly Georgia and Portugal.\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday he said he no regrets with leaving experienced players such as Quade Cooper and Michael Hooper out of the side for the tournament.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their own judgment and they\u2019re allowed to have that judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cMy choice was that I decided to go with youth. And I stand by that because I think we\u2019ve got a a lot of good young players who are really going to benefit from that experience at the World Cup, and going forward to the 2027 World Cup.\u201d\nIt was reported during the campaign that Jones had an interview for the Japan head coach role but he denied that again on Tuesday, having previously also denied the story.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been speaking to anyone, mate,\u201d was all Jones would say on multiple reports of conversations with sources in Japanese rugby.\nHe said he understood why Australian fans were hurting.\n\u201cWe feel all the supporters hurt and really appreciate the great support we had in France and back in Australia for the team,\u201d said Jones.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cSometimes the change you have to have is uncomfortable. It is quite difficult. And sometimes you have to go through this to get into a better state and I believe that the problems we\u2019ve had particularly at the national team will put us in a better state going forward.\u201d\nJones clearly believes he is the right man to carry Australia on.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got the foresight to see where we need to go. I\u2019ve got the experience of being in difficult situations before,\u201d Jones said.\n\u201cThis is not an unusual situation. You\u2019ve got a team that was struggling for a period of time, you\u2019ve got underneath it a system that\u2019s not supporting it and at some stage you bottom out.\n\u201cThis is the opportunity now to change the team- as we\u2019ve started with picking younger players with bright futures \u2013 and then we\u2019ve got to look at the development system underneath as well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a simple equation that the Wallabies are bad. Let\u2019s be serious about this. The Wallabies are not where they need to be but underneath that we need to fix the system to go forward. And if we can do that now we\u2019ve got a rosy future.\u201d\nSports opinion delivered daily\n\nThis article, authored by Tony Harper, was published by The Roar | Sports Writers Blog on 2023-10-16 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":407}

They couldn't finish the job. On Wednesday night, they'll have a chance to avenge that painful finish.\nTexas found out before Tuesday's Game 4 that slugger Adolis Garcia's season was over, but a talented lineup didn't miss a beat. The Rangers erupted for five runs in the second inning and five more in the third, bludgeoning Arizona's bullpen to take a 10-0 lead in the blink of an eye.\nCorey Seager came through with his third home run of the series, while Marcus Semien drove in five of the Rangers' first 10 runs \u2014 including a three-run blast that put Texas up by double digits.\nFAGAN: Three things Diamondbacks need to flip script on World Series\nThe Diamondbacks have earned a reputation for not backing down, and to their credit, they didn't. Arizona scored six runs over the final two innings, putting together competitive at-bats despite the dramatic deficit and forcing the Rangers to go to closer Jose Leclerc for the final out.\nStill, it wasn't nearly enough. The Diamondbacks' best hope is that their late-game surge carries over to Game 5, where they will face elimination for the third time in this postseason.\nThe Rangers just need one more win to become World Series champions, and they will have the right man on the mound in Game 5 as Nathan Eovaldi makes his sixth start of the postseason. Zac Gallen, who was less than sharp in October but earned Cy Young consideration during the regular season, will start for the Diamondbacks with everything on the line for Arizona.\nMORE: How Bruce Bochy went from retirement to World Series in one year\nThe Sporting News tracked live scoring updates and highlights from Game 4 of the 2023 World Series between the Rangers and Diamondbacks.

{"title":"Strategizing for sustainable development","context":"## Strategizing for sustainable development\n\nPublic policies attempt to fulfill one or more of the following objectives: efficiency, equity, and stability. Efficiency and stability are necessary conditions for sustainable growth while equity helps make development inclusive.\nThis is the second article in our series following the 2nd SGV Tax Symposium, which focused on how a sustainable and effective tax ecosystem can advance the sustainability agenda for both the public and private sectors.\nIn this article, we will discuss the Philippine strategy for sustainable development.\nGROWTH THROUGH TRADE AND INVESTMENT\nThe Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028 aims for a deep economic and social transformation to reinvigorate job creation and accelerate poverty reduction by steering the economy back to a high-growth path. In this regard, two main performance indicators are identified and will be monitored by the National Government.\nThe first is for the country to graduate into upper middle-income class status within the term of the current administration. For this, the economy must grow its per capita income above the threshold set by the World Bank, which means a gross national income (GNI) per capita of at least $4,466. In 2022, the Philippines achieved a GNI per capita of $3,950.\nThe second is to lower the poverty level from 18.1% in 2021 to single digits by 2028 \u2014 the end of the term of the current administration. Both indicators require high growth rates. For the next year through 2028, the government pencils the growth rate between 6.5% and 8%.\nGrowth is expected to be investment-led with the implementation of structural changes such as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) law, which lowered the corporate income tax rate, and the amendments to the Public Service Act (PSA), Foreign Investment Act (FIA), and Retail Trade Liberalization Act (RTLA), which further liberalized the economy. The new legislation is expected to attract more local and foreign investment, especially in the liberalized sectors. For the energy sector in particular, amendments to the PSA are envisioned to help raise the capital needed to speed up the energy transition of the country to renewables.\nIn addition, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a trading bloc that encompasses the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ASEAN Plus One Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, is already in force for the Philippines, helping ease market access through trade and investment rules and supporting global and regional supply chains. The Philippines can potentially position itself as a regional manufacturing hub if the right incentives and policy measures are put in place to encourage local and foreign investors to participate. Together, trade and investment are expected to play an important role in attaining economic transformation, the second goal of the PDP.\nHUMAN CAPITAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nThe ability of people to take advantage of market opportunities arising from investment rests on human capital. To this end, the first goal of the PDP is social transformation which includes, among others, sustained expenditure on social services, mainly education, health, and social protection.\nThe first two goals of the PDP help attain the developmental objectives of efficiency and equity, which rest on the pillars of sustainability and resilience. The third fosters societal resilience: an enabling environment encompassing institutions, macroeconomic stability, and the physical and natural environment.\nInstitutions are vital to economic acceleration, which is why the government\u2019s steps to enhance the ease of doing business are most welcome. Infrastructure development also enables an economy to sustain higher levels of growth, which, in turn, catalyzes yet more investment. The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Act is up for the signature of President Marcos and, if approved, is expected to further enhance the business atmosphere in mobilizing private resources for infrastructure development.\nThe government aims to sustain its infrastructure program at 5-6% of GDP through 2028 amid a six-year medium-term fiscal framework. This plan gradually narrows the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, down from 7.3% in 2022, such that the debt-to-GDP ratio is reduced from nearly 61% in 2022 to a more sustainable level of at most 53% by 2028.\nDEBT MANAGEMENT\nThe National Government\u2019s debt was less than 40% before the pandemic struck. It expended much of its fiscal space combatting the pandemic, incurring debt and large budget deficits. While the current 61% debt-to-GDP ratio may be manageable for an emerging economy like the Philippines for some time, the country may not have the fiscal space to respond to another potential domestic or external shock. If the debt continues to rise more than the economy, risks will increase, and the government may \u201ccrowd out\u201d private investment as it competes with the private sector for funds to service its debt.\nThe planned fiscal consolidation entails harmonizing the revenue needs with the promotion of investment through the structure and administration of the reformed incentive system. The National Government plans to raise more revenue to finance the country\u2019s socio-economic needs, largely through a progressive and simplified tax system, more efficient and effective tax collection measures through digitalization and, to some extent, from policy measures such as value-added tax on digital service providers and excise tax on sweetened beverages and junk food.\nAchieving fiscal stability presupposes the sustainability of fiscal policy, and fiscal stability helps \u201ccrowd in\u201d private investment.\nPRICE STABILITY AND INFLATION\nIn his second State of the Nation Address (SONA), President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. singled out inflation as the country\u2019s most pressing problem. In the first nine months of 2023, inflation averaged 6.6% \u2014 far above the upper end of the target range of 2-4% set by the BSP. If left unchecked, inflation could undermine growth. Not only does this increase costs to organizations, but it also sets in motion second-round effects as workers start demanding higher wages, consequently increasing business costs and discouraging investments.\nInflation is partly driven by supply-side issues and the government is allocating more resources to the agriculture sector to boost production. Mr. Marcos also mentioned that the National Government had distributed 28,000 new tools and machinery to farmers. An additional 600 km of farm-to-market roads were laid down to support the 14 million hectares of farmland, enhancing farmer access to markets. In addition, he signed Executive Order No. 28 in May, forming the Inter-Agency Committee on Inflation and Market Outlook, which is tasked to keep inflation within government targets and boost the economy.\nENHANCING CLIMATE RESILIENCE\nWhile price stability and fiscal sustainability are important macroeconomic issues, environmental sustainability is increasingly gaining importance. Climate change uncertainties and challenges need to be managed and both the Philippine government and the private sector are hard-pressed to deliver their commitments to addressing them. Despite climate change risks, the Philippines has the opportunity to position itself as a prime destination of foreign investments against climate change or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments.\nThe government calls for embedding resilience, sustainability, and nature-based solutions in infrastructure planning and investment to enhance climate resilience. Likewise, investments in renewable energy are expected not only to enhance energy security but also reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nFrom an economic vantage point, GHG emissions are economic \u201cbads\u201d and are a cause of inefficiency as they get over-produced. Their effects, however, go beyond national borders, and while the Philippines contributes minimally to global GHG emissions, the World Risk Index 2022 report identifies the Philippines as the most disaster-prone country in the world.\nThe government envisions that by 2028: (1) Climate and disaster risk resilience of communities and institutions will increase (2) Ecosystem resilience will be enhanced, and (3) A low-carbon economy transition is enabled.\nTo ensure that these are realized, the government is set to safeguard cross-sectoral convergence and implement a comprehensive risk management approach to address the adverse consequences posed by climate change. It will also promote a green and blue economy coupled with improved governance to guarantee long-term climate and disaster resilience.\nBUILDING RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\nComing off from the pandemic and with the current global economic climate, it is opportune for the government to proactively drive for actionable policies and programs that focus on building the resiliency of the economy through sustainable development with greater emphasis given to addressing climate change.\nNavigating external and domestic economic headwinds will not be an easy feat for the administration, but the private sector will be an important catalyst for sustainable development. With the private sector sharing industry knowledge, resources and potentially even leading certain socio-economic programs and projects of the National Government, it is to be hoped that AmBisyon Natin 2040 of long and healthy lives for Filipinos that are strongly rooted, comfortable, and secure will be achieved.\nThis article is for general information only and is not a substitute for professional advice where the facts and circumstances warrant.

{"title":"Michigan State hires Jonathan Smith: Oregon State coach leaves alma mater to take over Spartans job","context":"## Michigan State hires Jonathan Smith: Oregon State coach leaves alma mater to take over Spartans job\n\nMichigan State has hired Jonathan Smith as its next football coach, the school announced on Saturday. Smith, 44, has spent the past six seasons as coach at Oregon State where he's guided the Beavers to 18 wins over the past two seasons, including a 10-3 mark and No. 17 finish in the AP Top 25 during a 2022 campaign that earned him Pac-12 Coach of the Year honors.\nSmith was among the initial pool of candidates linked to the Michigan State opening after the Spartans fired fourth-year coach Mel Tucker with cause midseason amid sexual harassment allegations. Smith later emerged as the leading candidate to replace Tucker during the final week of the regular season, which saw Oregon State suffer a 31-7 loss at rival Oregon.\n\"Jonathan has a proven track record of success, building the Oregon State program from the ground up by implementing a plan resulting in sustained historic success for the Beavers,\" said Michigan State athletic director Alan Haller in announcing the hire. \"He's been a part of championship staffs, coached in the College Football Playoff, and understands what's required to be successful at the highest level, learning from some of the game's most successful coaches.\n\"On the field, his teams are tough and physical, yet innovative. This year, Oregon State has controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, ranking among the nation's leaders in both rushing offense and rushing defense. He's shown not only the ability to recruit talented student-athletes who fit his system, but also to develop and maximize players once they're in the program.\"\nSmith, a former quarterback for the Beavers from 1998-2001, exits Oregon State with a 34-35 overall mark as coach, including a 1-1 record in bowl games, as he now joins the Big Ten coaching ranks.\n\"As I start this next chapter of my coaching career, I want to first thank all the players, coaches and colleagues I have worked with the last six years,\" Smith said in a statement posted to social media. \"I will cherish the memories and friendships. I also want to express my deepest gratitude to the people of OSU\/Corvallis for your support. When I first arrived as a freshman college student, I had no idea the opportunities and relationships this community would provide for me and my family. The collective impact you have made makes it impossible to thank everyone individually, but I am forever grateful.\"\nOregon State left in dust amid uncertain future\nAlthough Smith narrowly finished below. 500 in six seasons at the helm in Corvallis, Oregon, the Beavers made clear progress during the back half of his tenure. Smith guided Oregon State to seven victories in 2021 after the program went 9-22 during his first three years. The 2022 season, which marked the Beavers' first 10-win season since 2006 and highest AP Top 25 finish since 2000, resulted in a contract extension for Smith through February 2029 that bumped his annual salary to $4.85 million. Oregon State then started the 2023 season 8-2 before dropping back-to-back games against Washington and Oregon.\nEarlier in the week, Oregon State athletic director Scott Barnes called it the \"No. 1 priority\" to reach a contract extension with Smith as speculation of this move began to grow. In a statement Saturday after Smith's departure was finalized, Barnes thanked him for his efforts at Oregon State as the Beavers now embark on the search for Smith's replacement.\n\"Coach Smith and his staff worked tirelessly to rebuild the culture at Oregon State, both on the field and in the classroom,\" Barnes said. \"All of Beaver Nation should thank him for the lasting legacy he has left to his alma mater and wish him and his family nothing but the best moving forward.\"\nSmith held multiple assistant jobs from 2002-17 before returning to his alma mater as coach in 2018. Smith spent six seasons as an assistant under former college football coach Chris Petersen, first as Boise State's quarterbacks coach from 2012-13 and then as Washington's quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator from 2014-17. His time in Seattle included a Pac-12 title and College Football Playoff berth for Washington during the 2016 season.\nSmith's exit from Oregon State comes at a point where the Beavers face much uncertainty as the Pac-12 prepares to lose 10 of its 12 members ahead of the 2024 season. Oregon State and Washington State are the only schools in the conference that have not been picked up by other power leagues. Four Pac-12 members -- USC, UCLA, Washington and Oregon -- will join Smith in the Big Ten next fall.\nCan Smith turn the Michigan State program around?\nThe task now for Smith is revitalizing a Michigan State program that has struggled to field consistent success in recent seasons. After winning 10 or more games six times in a span of eight seasons under former coach Mark Dantonio from 2010-17, the Spartans have only won more than seven games in a season once since then, finishing 11-2 under Tucker's second year at the helm in 2021.\nWhat seemed to be a breakthrough season for Tucker in 2021 earned him a 10-year contract extension worth $95 million, but Tucker's remaining tenure in East Lansing was all downhill afterwards. Michigan State regressed to 5-7 in 2022 before allegations of sexual harassment surrounding Tucker against rape survivor and activist Brenda Tracy emerged just two games into the 2023 season. Tucker was promptly suspended before the school fired him with cause several weeks later. The Spartans went on to finish 4-8 with assistant Harlon Barnett serving as interim coach the rest of the way, ending the season with a 42-0 loss to Penn State on Friday.\nWhile Michigan State has found itself playing in a stacked Big Ten East division for roughly the last decade -- Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State have all been annual opponents -- that will change in Smith's debut season as the Big Ten expands and does away with divisions. Smith will also get the chance to face some familiar opponents from his time at Oregon State given that four Pac-12 schools are joining the conference. As far as the 2024 season is concerned on that front, Michigan State still faces Ohio State and Michigan (the Wolverines are a protected rival) but avoids Penn State. Oregon is the only newcomer it will face next fall, with the Spartans set to travel to Eugene, Oregon, in early October.\n\nThis article, authored by Dean Straka, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-11-25 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":411}

She\u2019s also an executive producer and host of \u201cGroundbreakers,\u201d a documentary about female athletes that airs on PBS on Nov. 21.\nThere\u2019s an effort by members of Congress to award King the Congressional Gold Medal, one of the highest U.S. civilian honors given to individuals whose achievements have a lasting impact in their field.\nHere\u2019s a Q&A with King, which has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n___\nAP: It\u2019s the 50th anniversary of so many accomplishments in 1973. Talk about that whirlwind.\nKING: We started the WTA four days before Wimbledon. I won all three titles at Wimbledon, which for me was a big deal. Then equal prize money came into being, it started in 1972 with us saying we\u2019re not coming back (to the U.S. Open in 1973). Then King-Riggs. That\u2019s all in 3 months. I can appreciate it since being away from it so long. How the heck did we do that?\nYou\u2019ve said the King-Riggs match was about social change, women standing up for themselves in all areas.\nIt was really about men, too. Because men started to shift a little. Obama was 12 years old when he saw the King-Riggs match. He said it affected him a lot. Guys are much better thinking about their daughters than they used to be. All these things add up.\nYou\u2019re part of ownership groups for pro sports. How did you get involved in women\u2019s pro hockey, which will have teams in Boston, New York, Minnesota, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal?\nThe PWHL, it\u2019s really exciting. It took five years. Plus, it took all those years of the other leagues, everyone trying. (U.S. Olympic gold medalist) Kendall Coyne said, \u2018can you help us?\u2019 We need to have a league where the very best players will play. We went to Toronto and I did an opening speech about trailblazers. It was amazing because the families were crying, the players were crying, they said \u2018we\u2019ve never been treated like this, it\u2019s amazing, we feel like pros for the first time.\u2019 There were a lot of little kids there. Kids are going to have an amazing opportunity that the generations before them never had. All three of their networks had it on. It\u2019s a religion up there.\nHow is investment in women\u2019s sports changing?\nI\u2019m asking CEOs and everyone now \u2014 \u2018do you invest as much in women as you do in men?\u2019 Then it usually gets quiet. But I must say it\u2019s better than it used to be. We\u2019re really lucky to be with this investment group. The male allies we\u2019ve had through the years have made such a difference. They have the money and the power. But we\u2019re getting there, getting more and more women investors, particularly in soccer. Women\u2019s sports, we\u2019ve all been fighting for it.\nWhat would you like to see in the future for women\u2019s sports?\nMore. And make sure we get girls early in life into sports. It\u2019s really about the health issue, more than anything. More jobs, more everything. Women of color and diversity is really important.\nWe only get 5% of the media. That\u2019s where the money is. People always say, \u2018why doesn\u2019t the WTA have as much money as the ATP?\u2019 I\u2019m like, really? If you watch a show at night, a sports show, just count how many minutes are on men and how many minutes are on women. We\u2019re at 5%.

He would sit and watch the then Israeli ambassador to the UK Mark Regev on television and say to himself, \"That's what I want to do when I grow up.\"\nToday, aged 32, that is exactly what he is doing - battling day and night on screens to make the world acknowledge the atrocities and the reality forced on Israel since October 7, as a government spokesperson to the international media at the National Public Diplomacy Directorate in the Prime Minister's Office.\nHe tells \"Globes,\" \"Perhaps you won't believe it but it has always been my dream to act as a spokesperson for the state. It's a shame that it's in such painful circumstances. The legendary Mark Regev and myself have been working shifts on the TV channels worldwide and I remember how I watched him as a kid in London and wanted to do what he is doing.\"\nBack in October few people had heard of Levy. But now sitting in a caf\u00e9 in the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv to be interviewed by \"Globes,\" passersby clearly recognize him and some even stop to take a selfie with him.\nTo filter out the bullshit\nIn recent weeks, interviews with Levy have gained massive exposure worldwide and the Israeli public has embraced the eloquent and quick-witted spokesperson who has been articulating Israel's point of view so admirably, with his English accent. With degrees from both Oxford and Cambridge, Levy received the greatest exposure in an interview with UK Sky News presenter Kay Burley, who asked him whether the fact that Israel is willing to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for 50 Israeli hostages indicates that Israel thinks that Palestinian lives are worth less.\nLevy's spontaneous, shocked response saw his eyes open wide with surprise and his eyebrows shoot up. But within a second he had regained his composure and explained that Israel would release one Palestinian for each Jewish hostage if it could. \"We did not choose to release these prisoners who have blood on their hands. That's a disgusting accusation.\"\nThe strange question aroused anger and criticism worldwide but Kate Burley did not apologize and even justified her question on X (formerly Twitter) by saying that interviewers sometimes present one side of an argument so that those being interviewed can refute it. She claimed that she was presenting a controversial opinion that she had heard to allow the interviewee to respond.\nLevy does not accept this explanation. \"It's true that the role of the media is to challenge speakers with controversial opinions but it is also to filter out the bullshit and to know when you have been told nonsense that requires no further comment,\" he says.\nLevy posted the clip from the interview on his Twitter account and it received 16 million views and 15,000 shares (just from the Tweet). His number of followers has soared from 24,000 before the war to 140,000 after the Sky News interview. At the same time his look of astonishment and raised eyebrows have become a popular meme and WhatsApp sticker. \"If you would have told me several weeks ago that people would make memes of my face I wouldn't have believed it. But joking aside, we are here to explain the story of Israel abroad, if along the way there are amusing moments that allow people to enjoy a funny moment amid all the darkness and gloom we are experiencing, then let the joke be on me.\"\nAre you are asked many questions that smack of antisemitism, or lack of understanding and support for Israel's position?\nHow long have you got? I was asked by the BBC in a radio interview whether there is CCTV evidence that the hostages are in Shifa Hospital and what medical treatment were they receiving. I was asked by Sky News about why Yahya Sinwar was releasing hostages, even though Israel is bombing Gaza and I had to explain that it was because Israel is bombing Gaza.\n\"I was asked twice, in Ireland and by the Voice of America, why Hamas had been begging for five weeks to return hostages and we were only now bowing to US pressure to take back our children. I was interviewed by Piers Morgan in London who is very confrontational, who spoke to me about pictures from Gaza and said 'this the most shocking thing I have ever seen.' And I told him Piers, 'the most shocking thing we have seen in our lives was the slaughter on October 7.' Then he answered 'you are right.'\"\nFrom questions like these, do you get the feeling that everyone in the world hates us and they are all anti-Semites?\n\"It's not true that everyone hates us and they are all anti-Semites. We enjoy a great deal of support in the world. People understand that what happened on October 7 crossed a line with atrocities that cannot be repeated and for which there can be no excuse. This is what gives us legitimacy in this war against Hamas and the understanding that it not possible not to respond to this.\"\nWhy is it so hard for the world to understand this point of view?\n\"We are faced with difficult images coming out of Gaza. Israeli TV does not show what viewers abroad see of the destruction as a result of the military campaign to destroy the terrorist infrastructure built beneath houses, hospitals, mosques and schools. The world sees these pictures and wants to understand why we are doing this to civilians in Gaza. We are asked for how long? What's the limit? And we have to explain things that to Israelis sound self-evident, but in the world to those who do not live in our reality, they are incomprehensible. We must explain that this is a war imposed by Hamas through the most terrible massacre since the Holocaust, and it is a war that we must win because Hamas has repeated that it wants to carry out more October 7s until it murders every man, woman and child in our country.\"\nDo the explanations produce greater acceptance?\n\"Yes. There is understanding that we must end this war by destroying the capabilities of Hamas, otherwise we will be in the same situation in another six months. This is something I explain a lot to the Irish, for example. The Irish have been pressing for a ceasefire for a long time and I explain to them that if we had taken their advice and stopped firing then little Emily Hand would still be in captivity, and if we take their advice now to agree to a ceasefire then Hamas will commit more atrocities, because it will feel empowered and it will come out of this war with a feeling that the world has its back.\n\"We are being asked difficult questions about the dead on the other side and we must remind them that everyone who was killed in the Gaza Strip over the last month would be alive today if Hamas had not started the atrocities on October 7, and then decided to fight in populated areas, while preventing people from leaving despite all of Israel's efforts for over a month to evacuate civilians from the battle zones.\"\nLies continue to echo\nIn recent weeks Levy, and all Israel's spokespeople and volunteers in the National Public Diplomacy Directorate, headed by Moshe Aviv, have been working around the clock. \"We try to be available 24\/7. Last Friday I was interviewed at six in the morning and I finished with a CNN interview the following morning at 2am. There was a Saturday when I did four interviews with the BBC and it's not just me. Mark Regev is doing interviews at all hours of the night as well as Tal Heinrich in the US who is being interviewed non-stop in prime time. I am part of an amazing team of professionals.\n\"The work is being done in collaboration with Israel Police, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the IDF Spokesperson, the Israel prisons Service, the Shin Bet, the National Security Council and the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, which is responsible for producing items for digital channels. It's amazing to see every day when we all assess the situation, how all these bodies put their egos aside and I'm proud to be a part of it. If any channel wants an official spokesperson for the Israeli government, then we will be there because we cannot abandon the battlefield.\"\nThe world does not make life easy for Israel's spokespeople, to say the least, compared with the ease with which the Hamas narrative is adopted. \"I remember an interview the day after the bluff about the Al-Ahli hospital, which the Palestinians claimed had been hit by an Israeli missile, killing 800 civilians, but in the end it turned out that it was actually by a splinter group of Islamic Jihad, and that no hospital was destroyed and certainly not 800 people were killed. I explained to them in Sky News that Hamas lies and makes up numbers and the reporter asks me almost speechless with surprise, if I doubt Hamas' numbers.\"\nLevy describes these moments as intensely frustrating. He recounts, \"In a BBC interview, the interviewer told me 'Hamas denies what you are saying,' and you see the frustration on my face when I tell her that of course Hamas denies this. Hamas denies that it is even holding hostages. Hamas massacres, beheads, rapes, burns families, and then, day and night, denies that it did this.\n\"Some journalists around world see that Hamas continues to lie about the biggest things when the whole truth is in front of everyone's eyes, and they continue to echo the lies. This is not only a kinetic war in Gaza, it is also an information war.\"\nTwo months now, Levy has been fighting in this arena with the tools at his disposal. \"We are fighting to make it clear to the world that the information coming out of Gaza comes either directly from Hamas or from independent reporters and photographers that are part of the system in Gaza. Everyone knows that even if they are not affiliated with Hamas, they are not free to present the full truth, because they are not allowed to. There is not a single photo of a terrorist, there is not a single photo of a missile being launched from a densely populated area, from a mosque or a school, not even a single photo from the Hamas tunnels under Shifa. Why? Because these reporters, even if they are not explicitly on the side of Hamas, operate under a dictatorial regime and cannot provide the information even if they wanted to. And it is very important to continue reminding the world how much the information that reaches them is biased and does not reflect reality.\"\nDespite all this, Levy feels he must stress that not everyone is against us. \"I don't want to give the impression that all the interviewers are hostile and every question is delusional. Absolutely not. I have many interviews with reporters who understand what is happening here and simply want to get information and hear the Israeli side, which is completely legitimate.\"\nGeorge Galloway got up and walked out\nLevy was born and raised in England and attended a private school in North London in an area with a large Jewish population. He has always taken an interest in news and current affairs and a student was active in the world of debating, including tournaments. \"It would not be an exaggeration to say that I would sit in the bath reading The Economist. Arguing and opposing incorrect positions has always been one of my great hobbies. Alongside this, I grew up with a strong awareness of the importance of the State of Israel and its historical role in the history of our people. I have often had to explain Israel over the years.\"\nThe UK is currently in the headlines over anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations and antisemitism. Did you encounter antisemitism in your childhood there?\n\"I did not personally experience antisemitism but I was exposed to it during debates and every time there was a round of fighting I found myself defending Israel's position.\"\nOne of the most significant occasions on which Levy was defending Israel was in 2013, when he was an undergraduate at the University of Oxford, and was conducting a debate with British MP George Galloway on his remarks about Israel. \"Galloway is known as a notorious Israel hater. He arrived an hour late gave his crazy speech and sat down and then I spoke. In the middle of the speech I said 'we' referring to the State of Israel, and he stood up and asked me 'what do you mean we? Are you Israeli? When I answered yes, he said 'I don't do debates with Israelis. Goodbye' and left. It was filmed and the next morning all the UK media reported on it. It even made it into a cartoon in \"The Times.\"\nThat was a moment that reverberates for Levy when he sees what is currently happening in universities around the world. \"I look at what is happening on campuses around the world and tear my hair out, because I was there 10 years ago and tried to warn about the connection between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, how deep-rooted the hatred against Israel actually is and how many Jews are harmed by this blind hatred.\"\nIn 2014, on completing his master's degree in international relations at the University of Cambridge, Levy found himself at the crossroads that led him to Israel: \"One option was to study law and work as a lawyer in London, and the other option was to go on a Zionist adventure. That summer I was on the March of the Living and I remember myself standing wrapped in a flag and crying, realizing that a decision had been made. I decided that I was immigrating to Israel and enlisting in the army at the age of 23.\"\nThe decision was made just as Operation Protective Edge (2014) began. \"I wanted to enlist to help in the war. It was the scariest experience in my life. I remember a child who looked out the window and said, 'Dad, I think I saw a missile.'\"\nWhen I actually immigrated to Israel, the taxi driver told me that the war had finished six months previously. Even so I reported the next day to the IDF Induction Center in Tel Hashomer.\"\nLevy served in the command center of the IDF coordinator of activities in the administered territories, which is responsible for civil policies and security coordination with the Israeli government in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip. After his army service he worked as a newsreader for the English news on the Israel Broadcasting Authority and then as a newsreader for i24News. He served as foreign media advisor for President Isaac Herzog for two years until May 2023 and has translated some 30 books from Hebrew to English. He was also active in the protests against the government's judicial reform.\nSo how does that all fit together - one day you are at a demonstration against the government and the next day you are its spokesperson?\n\"Like many, I participated in the protests against the reform. It's no secret. There was Israel before October 7 and there is Israel after. Nothing will return to what it was before. There is now only one task: to win the war, and for that we must put the wars of the Jews aside and unite.\"\nThis is also the message with which Levy wants to conclude the interview. \"It's amazing to see how Israeli society has come to its senses after the traumas. One of our strengths is that everyone works for everyone,\" he says proudly. \"When I left synagogue on Yom Kippur after the concluding services and I saw what was happening in Dizengoff Square with all the shoving and the shouting, I found myself on the verge of tears. Today I miss the days when we were on the verge of a civil war because of a gender partition (in Dizengoff Square).\"\n\"It's so ridiculous what we argued about and what we pulled our hair out over for before October 7, a date that reminds us all of the big picture, why we are here, why we owe each other and in the end also love each other. It's sad that it took such a tragedy to remind us of the importance of unity in the nation, but we must maintain it.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on December 3, 2023.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023.\n\nThis article, authored by Ela Levi-Weinreb, was published by Globes English | Israel Business Arena on 2023-12-03 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":413}
{"title":"Damien Penaud leads historic rout of Italy as France confirm progress in style","context":"## Damien Penaud leads historic rout of Italy as France confirm progress in style\n\nEt voil\u00e0. France are through to the quarter-finals after the tournament\u2019s latest mismatch against a demoralised Italy. The unthinkable outcome \u2013 a pool-stage exit for Fabien Galthi\u00e9\u2019s side \u2013 had remained a possibility, but was never on the cards from the moment Damian Penaud scored the first of eight French tries in the second minute. France have beaten Italy 14 times consecutively, a run stretching back to 2014.\nIf the predatory Penaud\u2019s progress is a marker of France\u2019s hopes, their fellow title contenders should be worried. The wing has scored in seven straight matches and 14 times this year. Two tries here took him to second overall in their men\u2019s try-scorers\u2019 chart, with 35, three behind Serge Blanco. As a whole, the French machine is tuning up satisfactorily with top spot in Pool A secured. A potential last-eight collision with Ireland or South Africa, or indeed Scotland, will be a monumental affair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to congratulate Damian for his attacking performance,\u201d Galthi\u00e9 said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also easy when you have a team like that working for you. Players that become great are served by their teams; there\u2019s always a balance.\u201d The former France scrum-half added: \u201cWe\u2019re happy to qualify \u2026 We\u2019ll recuperate together, celebrate qualification, then turn to the quarter-final. For us, after a World Cup final against New Zealand [on opening night], our game next Sunday will be a second final.\u201d\nFor Kieran Crowley, Galthi\u00e9\u2019s opposite number, his Italy tenure ends in profound disappointment, although crushing defeats by the All Blacks and now the hosts are offset by victories against Namibia and Uruguay.\n\u201cI\u2019ve said before, I\u2019d like to take this team forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the next World Cup is our cycle \u2026 we\u2019ll get to the next tournament, and a lot of these players will have 60, 70 caps. But that wasn\u2019t my decision.\n\u201cWhat needs to happen is that these players need to be treated with a bit of respect off the field \u2026 They [the Italian Rugby Federation] need to get some of that stuff sorted. Quite honestly, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want to be involved unless that gets sorted. I respect these guys, these players and staff. They\u2019ve gone way beyond \u2026 and yet people will judge us on these last two games. It\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\nDamaging setbacks have arrived with regularity for France, most notably Antoine Dupont\u2019s fractured cheekbone. But the prop Cyril Baille had returned from injury in the thrashing of Namibia, along with the estimable Jonathan Danty in midfield, and both started against Italy.\nAny hint of home nerves was calmed by the try for Penaud that stemmed from the first attack. Uini Atonio and Thibaud Flament were both involved, busting through tackles and creating a huge overlap for Penaud. Thomas Ramos belted over a penalty and the pressure on Italy continued unabated, Penaud fluffing a grubber kick with another big overlap created.\nThe hosts quickly came again, and Penaud got his kick right this time, picking out Louis Bielle-Biarrey with a chip that the wing converted impeccably. Ramos flopped over after another fluent exchange with Ga\u00ebl Fickou.\nLouis Bielle-Biarrey scores France\u2019s try to again underline his potential. Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat\/AFP\/Getty Images\nAt 24-0 Italy temporarily steadied a listing ship. After Ange Capuozzo was removed for a head injury assessment, Simone Ferrari powered over, but the television match official spotted a high hit by Ferrari on Maxime Lucu and the try was chalked off. Almost immediately, Penaud went over at the other end to secure a bonus point after fielding Matthieu Jalibert\u2019s cross-kick. It was 31-0 at half-time.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Breakdown Free weekly newsletter The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The important thing is that at the end of the game, we end up ahead. We are not here to show off, or to look good. We\u2019re here to win.\u201d He added that he expects the injured Dupont and Julien Marchand to play during the knockout stages.\nWhen flanker Charles Ollivon \u2013 sitting alongside his head coach \u2013 was asked about next Sunday\u2019s opponents, Galthi\u00e9 interjected. \u201cWe can\u2019t know our opponent. Have you played tomorrow\u2019s game already? There is a Scotland v Ireland game that may modify the quarter-finals. If you are talking about our quarter-final opponents, it\u2019s quite simple.

{"title":"A timeline of Sam Altman\u2019s firing from OpenAI \u2014 and the fallout","context":"## A timeline of Sam Altman\u2019s firing from OpenAI \u2014 and the fallout\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events late Friday, ex-Y Combinator president Sam Altman was fired as CEO of AI startup OpenAI, the company behind viral AI hits like ChatGPT, GPT-4 and DALL-E 3, by OpenAI\u2019s board of directors. Then, the company\u2019s longtime president and co-founder, Greg Brockman, resigned \u2014 as did three senior OpenAI researchers. And the fallout continues.\nTip TechCrunch\nDo you work at OpenAI and know more about Sam Altman\u2019s departure?\nDo you work at OpenAI and know more about Sam Altman\u2019s departure? Get in touch with TechCrunch\nIt\u2019s a fast-moving situation that we\u2019re still trying to get to the bottom of. No doubt more will become clear as time goes on. To make it easier to follow all that\u2019s happened in the meantime, though, we\u2019ve put together a timeline; we\u2019ll do our best to keep it current.\nTimeline of Sam Altman\u2019s firing from OpenAI\nNovember 29\nMicrosoft gains a board observer\nMicrosoft will gain representation on the new initial board of directors in the form of a non-voting observer, OpenAI announced. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear who this observer might be \u2014 only that they won\u2019t have an official vote in board business.\nNovember 21\nSam Altman, OpenAI reach agreement on return as CEO and \u2018initial\u2019 new board\nIn a sudden late announcement, OpenAI revealed that it and Altman \u201chave reached an agreement in principle\u201d for him to return as the company\u2019s CEO. In addition to Altman\u2019s return, its new \u201cinitial\u201d board will include former Salesforce chief executive Bret Taylor, former US Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers and Quora founder Adam D\u2019Angelo.\nWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo. We are collaborating to figure out the details. Thank you so much for your patience through this. \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) November 22, 2023\nAltman also posted about the new deal, giving some insight into the roller coaster that we\u2019ve all been riding since his firing was revealed Friday. In his words, his decision to join Microsoft on Sunday \u201cwas the best path for me and the team.\u201d Since then, the new board\u2019s composition and Microsoft\u2019s support appear to have been enough to bring him back to the AI company he co-founded.\nAltman and board in talks\nOpenAI\u2019s board of directors is reportedly in talks with Sam Altman, ex-Y Combinator president and an OpenAI co-founder, to return to OpenAI as CEO as soon as this week. That\u2019s according to Bloomberg, which in a brief \u2014 citing sources close to the matter \u2014 said that discussions are happening between Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo, one current member of the OpenAI board, and Altman \u2014 and possibly other board members as well.\nBoard tensions boil over\nThe New York Times reports that, before his ousting, Sam Altman made a move to push out board member Helen Toner because he thought a paper she had co-written was overly critical of OpenAI. That, among other issues, led to OpenAI\u2019s current predicament. Speaking of, The Times indicates that negotiations to hire Altman back continue \u2014 but that one major sticking point remaining is \u201cguardrails\u201d meant to improve Altman\u2019s communication with the board.\n\u2014\nNovember 20\nAltman joins Microsoft\nSam Altman, Greg Brockman and colleagues announce that they\u2019ll join Microsoft to lead a new AI research team. Nadella leaves the door open to other OpenAI staffers, saying that they\u2019ll be given the resources they need should they choose to join.\nSutskever\u2019s mea culpa\nSutskever publishes a post on X suggesting that he regrets his decision to remove Altman and that he\u2019ll do everything in his power to reinstate Altman as CEO.\nI deeply regret my participation in the board's actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company. \u2014 Ilya Sutskever (@ilyasut) November 20, 2023\nEmployees threaten to resign\nNearly 500 of OpenAI\u2019s roughly 770 employees \u2014 including, remarkably, Sutskever \u2014 publish a letter saying that they might quit unless the startup\u2019s board resigns and reappoints the ousted Altman. Later Monday, that number climbed to over 650.\nAltman and Brockman considering return\nAs reported by The Verge, Altman\u2019s move to Microsoft isn\u2019t a done deal \u2014 and both Altman and Brockman are still open to returning to OpenAI. That is, if the remaining board members who initially fired him step aside.\nOpenAI board considers merger\nOpenAI\u2019s board of directors approached Dario Amodei, the co-founder and CEO of rival large-language model developer Anthropic, about a potential merger of the two companies, The Information reports. The approach was part of an effort by OpenAI to persuade Amodei to replace Altman as CEO \u2014 but Amodei quickly turned down the CEO offer.\n\u2014\nNovember 19\nAltman to meet at OpenAI HQ\nAccording to The Information, Altman is expected to meet at OpenAI\u2019s San Francisco headquarters as executives at OpenAI push to have him reinstated as CEO. Brockman was invited to join \u2014 but it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll take execs up on that invitation.\nBoard negotiations hit a snag\nBloomberg reports that Lightcap and Murati, among others, are pushing the board to reinstate Altman. But unsurprisingly, the directors are resisting. As of midday Sunday, the board hadn\u2019t resigned out of concern over who could replace them, and were vetting candidates. One possible new addition could be Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor.\nAltman out, Shear in\nAltman won\u2019t be returning as CEO, according to a report in The Information citing an internal memo sent by Sutskever. As the search for a new permanent CEO continues, OpenAI has appointed Emmett Shear, the co-founder of video streaming site Twitch, as interim CEO \u2014 replacing Murati.\n\u2014\nNovember 18\n\u201cNot \u2026 in response to malfeasance\u201d\nIn an internal memo obtained by Axios sent Saturday morning, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said yesterday\u2019s announcement \u201ctook [the management team] by surprise\u201d and that management had had \u201cmultiple conversations with the board to try to better understand the reasons and process behind their decision.\u201d Discussions were ongoing as of Saturday morning, per the memo.\n\u201cWe can say definitively that the board\u2019s decision was not made in response to malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security\/privacy practices,\u201d Lightcap added. \u201cThis was a breakdown in communication between Sam and the board \u2026 We still share your concerns about how the process has been handled, are working to resolve the situation, and will provide updates as we\u2019re able.\u201d\nOpenAI\u2019s funding in jeopardy\nThe planned sale of OpenAI employee shares that would value the startup at about $86 billion could be in jeopardy. The Information, speaking to three sources formerly with the company, reports that they no longer expect the sale \u2014 led by Thrive Capital \u2014 to happen, or, if it does, to come with a lesser valuation because of the recent turn of events.\nAltman planning new venture\nAltman has been telling investors that he\u2019s planning to launch a new venture, according to The Information. Brockman is expected to join the effort \u2014 whatever form it takes. (Possibly an AI chip startup.)\ni love you all. today was a weird experience in many ways. but one unexpected one is that it has been sorta like reading your own eulogy while you\u2019re still alive. the outpouring of love is awesome. one takeaway: go tell your friends how great you think they are. \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 18, 2023\nInvestors pushing for Altman\u2019s return\nInvestors \u2014 furious at the turn of events \u2014 are reportedly exerting pressure on OpenAI\u2019s board to reinstate Altman, going so far as to recruit Microsoft. Nadella is said to be sympathetic.\nBoard agrees to reverse course \u2014 in principle\nThe Verge reports that the board agreed in principle to resign and to allow Altman and Brockman to return. It waffled, however, missing a deadline yesterday by which many OpenAI staffers were set to leave the company. Altman is said to be ambivalent about coming back and asking for \u201csignificant\u201d governance changes.\n\u2014\nNovember 17\nBrockman demoted\nBrockman says he got a text from Sutskever shortly after noon on Friday asking for a quick call.

While some have outshone others, these 5 teams are at a crossroads, with a common stifling problem. Amid the heavy restructuring that many of the MLB teams have seen of late, there are pentagonal vacancies for managers. The New York Mets, the Los Angeles Angels, the Houston Astros, the Cleveland Guardians, and the San Diego Padres are in dire need of filling up the managerial position as the year ends.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nWhile some team representatives skim through names within the MLB world, some hope to look for an outside hire. It could be a risky state for all of them. Nevertheless, there are many possibilities and roadblocks one might encounter. Be it budgetary issues, past performance, or availability of candidates, these teams have not had success in putting a pin on one candidate. That said, the skipper market is abuzz!\nStarting With The Los Angeles Angels\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nAfter Joe Maddon was relieved of his managerial duties, Phil Nevin signed up as the interim manager for the remaining 106 games of 2022. Post that, he went on to sign a one-year contract to manage the Angels in 2023, and the interim tag was lifted. Nevin\u2019s 2024 club option was rejected by the Halos, who underwent partial two seasons of 119-149 (.444) play under his supervision. Since this was a non-negotiable, the seat stands vacant.\nThe biggest challenge in this scenario is that the Angels star, Shohei Ohtani is yet to reveal which team he would be joining. In case the Angels re-sign the two-way phenom, the manager would get to head the roster with the 2021 MVP and Mike Trout. A once in a lifetime opportunity. On the flip side, if they lose Ohtani, the roster would need a solid revamp. Not to mention the Angles are infamous for their below-par farm system and playoff drought spanning 9 seasons.\nWith that out in the open, what are the possible options for the Halos? Ray Montgomery could be an option, considering that he began his tenure with the Angels. Walt Weiss could potentially be a decent fit, too. Weiss has been a part of a successful team in the Atlanta Braves recently, having been their bench coach since before the 2018 season. Additionally, among other options are Ron Washington and Clayton McCullough. Though these options are open, no solid information has been revealed yet as to who would fill up the position.\nMoving On To The Houston Astros\nAfter his fourth season with the Astros and his 26th big league managerial season, Dusty Baker announced his retirement last week. Houston won the 2022 World Series and two pennants while the 74-year-old was in charge. Despite the starry possibilities of winning, the Texas Rangers defeated the Astros in the ALCS 2023.\nWith that seat now waiting to be warmed up, the future manager would manage a seasoned roster that appears ready to make another push at winning a World Series after winning six of the previous seven AL West championships. However, given Luis Garcia\u2019s Tommy John surgery and Lance McCullers Jr.\u2019s forearm surgery, the starting pitchers are expected to be shaky.\nThat said, there are some obvious options available to replace Dusty. One of the most sensible picks for a smooth transition would be Joe Espada, age 48. Since 2018, he has been the bench coach for the Astros. Baker relied on him in the dugout throughout his productive tenure as manager of Houston.\nApart from him, Buck Showalter, former New York Mets manager, Don Mattingly, Toronto Blue Jays bench coach, and A. J. Hinch, Detroit Tigers manager could be other possibilities.\nNext Up Is Cleveland Guardians\nFollowing an 11-year tenure with Cleveland that included leading the team to a 921-757 record (.549), six playoff trips, and the 2016 AL pennant, Terry Francona announced his resignation. The record made him the winningest manager in franchise history. He had managed the Guardians till the conclusion of the 2023 season, but now, owing to health concerns, he decides to put his wellbeing first.\nSince Cleveland usually has one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, the team\u2019s lineup won\u2019t be receiving a lot of outside reinforcement. It is clear that the Guardians are not keen on getting someone from within MLB; they are open to outside hires as well. As long as the new candidate can follow Terry\u2019s principles.\nOne applicant slated for an interview was Craig Albernaz. He is the catching and bullpen coach for the San Francisco Giants, according to Paul Hoynes of Cleveland.com. Despite lacking Major League managerial experience, the 40-year-old has led two championship-winning Tampa Bay Rays teams. Another likely candidate could be Carlos Mendoza, who is the bench coach for the New York Yankees. Though he too lacks managerial experience in MLB, the 43-year-old is familiar with the Yankees system, suiting well for Cleveland.\nSpeaking Of NY, The New York Mets Are On The Lookout\nIn his first season as manager, Buck Showalter guided the Mets to a 101-61 record. With that, he earned him the 2022 NL Manager of the Year Award. However, despite having baseball\u2019s largest budget, the Mets ended their 2023 with a disastrous 75-87. Under the new president of baseball operations David Stearns, the organization is taking a fresh approach. The man who described 2023 as \u201cthe roller coaster of disappointment and hope\u201d presiding over the Mets views his limited options.\nGabe Kapler made the exit three days before the San Francisco Giants season\u2019s conclusion; he could post as a suited candidate. Another likely possibility would be Craig Counsell, who is nearing the end of his contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. Counsell is the guy to watch out for this summer because of his excellent relationship with David Stearns. This newest president of baseball operations for the Mets is a former Brewer himself.\nThe Fifth Team In The List Is San Diego Padres\nBob Melvin was said to be returning to the Padres as manager, despite the team\u2019s 82-80 record and 2023 postseason absence. But in a turn of events, the San Francisco Giants hired Melvin when San Diego gave permission to interview him for SanFran\u2019s managerial vacancy.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nNow, the Padres\u2019 vacant position is linking to former Cardinals manager Mike Shildt multiple times. Bob Nightengale of USA Today Sports reports that Shildt is the front-runner to take over. \u201cThe Padres will be hiring their sixth manager in just 10 years under (general manager) A. J. Preller. Former St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Shildt is the favorite while associate manager Ryan Flaherty is getting strong consideration,\u201d Nightengale said. With that, one has to wait and watch who serves as the best fit.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nWith the facts broken down, it is a matter of time that the teams narrow down their best options. MLB world will welcome 2024 with high expectations. With new management, the fans expect teams to come back with great vigor and ferocity.\nWatch This Story: Every MLB Team That Has Never Won a World Series\n\nThis article, authored by Kanishka Prakash, was published by Essentially Sports on 2023-10-30 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":416}
{"title":"Teenage Engineering's K.O. II sampler proves the company can do cost-friendly cool","context":"## Teenage Engineering's K.O. II sampler proves the company can do cost-friendly cool\n\nThere's something of a theme running through Teenage Engineering's recent products. That theme is you need more money. The Field range represents the Swedish company\u2019s most exclusive music making gear. So when its website teased a new product with a colorful countdown, the wallets of Teenies everywhere braced for impact. Once that timer hit all zeros, the big reveal turned out to be the EP-133 sampler. Or, to give it its full name, the EP-133 K.O. II 64MB Sampler Composer. The real surprise though, was that it both looked cool and, at $299, was reasonably priced.\nFadergate\nThe countdown was really just the start. Barely 24 hours after the K.O. II was revealed units started landing in buyers\u2019 hands. Within days, YouTube was awash with first look videos and tutorials. Before our review unit even showed up, several users were complaining that theirs had defective faders. Enough folks were having this problem that it quickly became known as \u201cfadergate.\u201d One brave creator even took their unit apart and, possibly, discovered the cause \u2014 the internal pins were bent and not making a connection. I asked Teenage Engineering about the issue and will update this story once I hear back.\nSome buyer\u2019s theorized that the issue might be caused by the fact that the K.O. II ships without the caps on its rotaries and fader. They come loose in the box to enable the packaging to be flatter, but the cap for the fader is unusually tight fitting. This led to speculation that the enthusiasm required to push this cap down might be putting too much pressure on components inside, opening up the cruel possibility of users breaking their own devices before they even got to play with them. I used extra caution, along with some needle-nosed tweezers to support the fader as I applied its cap and so far\u2026 so good?\nPhoto by James Trew \/ Engadget\nThe K.O. II name tells us that Teenage Engineering considers this something of a sequel to the original PO-33 K.O. Clearly the K.O. II isn\u2019t a Pocket Operator, but its retro desk calculator aesthetic does take subtle design cues from that series. At 12-inches diagonally, it\u2019s in iPad territory size-wise. The K.O. II also runs on AAA batteries (or USB power) which is another nod to the PO series. It\u2019s hard to say how long it\u2019ll run on those batteries and it\u2019ll vary from brand to brand, but I\u2019ve been using some cheap rechargeables for over a week and they seem to be going strong.\nPersonally, I was never particularly enamored with the Pocket Operators and much prefer the form factor of the K.O. II. It\u2019s still very portable, but feels a bit more \u201cserious.\u201d It\u2019s also just very nice to look at, which is something Teenage Engineering is quite good at. The model number, EP-133, indicates that we might see others in the line, so fingers crossed for giant calculator versions of other instruments, too.\nIn use\nFader fully checked and batteries in place, the K.O. II springs to life with a flourish of icons across its display. Those icons are actually fixed and not made up of pixels. Teenage Engineering calls it a \u201cSuper segment hybrid display\u201d which basically fuses the digital watch part with a bunch of colorful, cute custom icons to let you know when certain modes or features are activated. It reminds me of the old Game & Watch handhelds where you can see where all the icons are and they are simply switched on or off as needed. Some of the icons are pretty abstract but there is a guide on the website to let you know that, for example, the red umbrella means undo.\nPhoto by James Trew \/ Engadget\nSomething I like to do with music gear is to see how easy it is to use without reading the manual. This works for all gadgets of course, but with music gear there are common tasks like sequencing, timing adjustment, automation and so on. How you achieve these on a drum machine might be very different to a keys-based synth. Teenage Engineering in particular likes to do things its own way but I was pleasantly surprised with the K.O. II. Within minutes I had managed to figure out basic navigation and how things are organized (sample groups, accessing shift functions, what the fader does and when and so on).\nDuring this blind test I also got to know the K.O. II\u2019s buttons and faders. It was obvious from the launch materials that we weren\u2019t getting rubber MPC-esque pads here but I would describe the ones on the K.O. as keys rather than buttons. Fortunately they are satisfying to click and they\u2019re pressure sensitive so you can give your drum hits different velocities or play notes at different strengths, just be sure to focus on the lower part of the key as that seems to be where the sensor is.\nYou probably should read the manual though. If for no other reason than it\u2019s likely the prettiest one you\u2019ll use in a while. There\u2019s also a very cute tool for managing your samples which works via desktop browser. For the brave, you can also use this on your phone if you have Android (Chrome, Brave and Opera should all work). On iOS the same browsers can\u2019t access Web MIDI and therefore will not work. (There\u2019s the iOS Web MIDI Browser which crashes when I tried it with an iPhone but it does connect so your mileage may vary.) The K.O. II won\u2019t show up on your PC as either a drive or an audio interface, so the main uses for the USB port are power and sending\/receiving MIDI.\nThe workflow for grabbing sounds is pretty straightforward. If you want to sample from either a PC or phone or other sound-making device then as long as you can connect it to a 3.5mm cable you\u2019re golden. For everything else, you\u2019ll be using the built-in mic, which is surprisingly good. I recorded a few short vocal phrases and other found sounds and they come out well, assuming you\u2019re in a quiet environment.\nPhoto by James Trew \/ Engadget\nDon\u2019t worry though, if you don\u2019t have a bunch of samples yet, the K.O. II comes with a bunch pre-installed, and they\u2019re pretty great. There\u2019s a good mix of drums, bass pads and lead sounds \u2014 certainly enough to get you going straight away. You\u2019ll definitely want to add your own though to make your projects unique. The presets use about half of the 64MB of memory, but you can back them up, delete them and free the slots up for your own. Max sample length is 20 seconds (same as on the OP-1 Field).\nIf 64MB doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, know that it translates to about 11 minutes of samples at the 46kHz\/16bit in which the K.O. II records. You can halve that time if you sample in stereo. Even if you go all out, over five minutes of samples should be plenty enough for most songs (we hope). If there\u2019s going to be a bottleneck, it\u2019ll more likely be due to the 12-voice limit. This means the K.O. II can make 12 sounds at once, so if you have six stereo samples playing at one time, you\u2019ll hit that limit. My compositions aren\u2019t interesting enough to hit that threshold, but if you\u2019re a maximalist, then it\u2019s worth keeping in mind.\nA common technique to help avoid hitting the voice limit on other devices is resampling \u2014 basically merging separate sounds down into one new sample. This is also the technique for baking in any effects and modulation, which, given that the K.O. II can only manage one master effect at any one time makes the lack of resampling all the more obvious. Understandably, it\u2019s possibly the biggest complaint among users I\u2019ve seen so far (after fadergate of course).\nThere are ways around this, but it would involve recording out into another device and then sampling that back into the K.O. II and no one should have a sampler for their sampler, not in this economy. Teenage Engineering does have a decent track record of adding functionality via firmware updates \u2014 the company just added a new effect to the OP-1 Field as I wrote this \u2014 so fingers crossed.\nPhoto by James Trew \/ Engadget\nWhile we\u2019re on the topic of features the K.O. II doesn\u2019t have, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any kind of song mode. There are four sample \u201cgroups\u201d that you can think of as tracks (drums, bass, lead and so on). Each of these groups can hold up to 99 patterns and patterns can be up to 99 bars in length. The active patterns across the four groups can be saved as a \u201cscene\u201d and scenes can be triggered consecutively. But, importantly, there\u2019s no way for that to happen automatically right now. This means if you wanted to tease a whole recorded song out of the K.O. II you\u2019ll have to either get clever with MIDI or trigger scenes and patterns manually in real time.\nThis performative nature might be a burden for songs, but I found it to be a feature in other areas. On top of the master effects you also have 12 \u201cpunch in\u201d effects that can be applied \u2014 or punched in \u2014 by holding down the FX key and then any of the 12 black pads. Each is marked with its effect name (Level, Pitch and so on). These punch-in effects express themselves differently based on the amount of pressure you apply, making it a very expressive experience. The effects on these keys also correspond to modulation tools when used with the fader. So FX+7 adds the \u201cLevel\u201d punch-in effect (rhythmic gating) while Fader+7 will assign gain\/level to the fader until you choose another modulator such as Attack or Low Pass Filter.\nI swear, half of the things you learn about how to use the K.O. II happen by accident. Yes, it\u2019s in the manual, but I discovered you can solo groups by pressing the FX button and the corresponding group. You can also press multiple buttons to \u201csolo\u201d multiple groups or sounds at the same time. With a group or group solo\u2019d you can then apply punch-in effects to create a lot of variations in real time. With so many touches like this, I am starting to assume that Teenage Engineering envisioned the K.O. II as a playful performative device rather than a linear song-making machine.\nPhoto by James Trew \/ Engadget\nI\u2019ve talked before about the sort of \u201cmagic\u201d factor that Teenage Engineering sometimes hides into its products. Just small, cute and often a bit hidden features that aren\u2019t necessary but are tons of fun. A common one is the inclusion of FM radio on the OP1\/Field and OB 4 etc. Or the video making tool in the app for the OP-Z. There was a brief moment of excitement when I spotted \u201cloop mode from OB-4\u201d on the K.O. II\u2019s product page. The hope being the two devices would interact somehow, but it appears that\u2019s just a way of describing the looping feature that\u2019s been borrowed from the OB-4.\nAs I write these closing thoughts, the second official firmware update (v1.1.1) has just been released. There\u2019s nothing spicy in here like motion control or sampling the radio, but it\u2019s confirmation of what I mentioned earlier about Teenage Engineering adding features after a product hits the shelves \u2014 such as the OP-1 Field\u2019s vocoder synth that landed over six months after release or the fairly substantial 1.2.38 update for the OP-Z which came almost three years into its life.\nThe K.O. II represents an opportunity for Teenage Engineering to do the unthinkable and create a series of more capable instruments that don\u2019t cost Field-series levels of money. As a sampler, it\u2019s great for beginners or those who love a more performative style. It\u2019s not nearly as detailed and in-depth as something like Roland\u2019s SP 404 or Native Instruments\u2019 Maschine, but it was never going to be a rival to, well, anything really. Fadergate aside, this is a promising product from a company that has tested the loyalty of its fans more than usual in recent years.\nAll products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

{"title":"Fundamental Investing: The Art of Relative Valuation","context":"## Fundamental Investing: The Art of Relative Valuation\n\nThe PE (price to earnings ratio) of a stock is 18. Is that cheap or expensive? Well, it depends. On what? Many things! Welcome to the world of relative valuation.\nThe findings from research done a decade earlier by Aswath Damodaran indicated that around 85 per cent of valuation done by equity research analysts and 50 per cent of corporate M&A transactions were based on relative valuation. So, what exactly is this relative valuation?\nIt is the art of attempting to determine the fair value of a stock based on how it is valued relative to many factors. So, whether the PE of a stock is 15 or 18 or 30, the only way you can make an assessment of whether it is cheap or expensive is by analysing this one number \u2014 against its growth prospects, peer company multiples, industry trading range, historical average PE, the prevailing interest rates, etc.\nPortfolio podcast: The art of valuing stocks Portfolio podcast: The art of valuing stocks\nLet there be no doubt, valuation experts like Aswath Damodaran and many successful hedge fund managers believe that absolute valuation (which we discussed in the Big Story in bl.portfolio edition dated October 8) is the better way to arrive at the value of a stock.\nHowever, due to a combination of complexities involved in building appropriate models, insufficient information, time constraints and also the fact that there are hundreds of stocks you want to consider, it is just not possible to do a DCF ( discounted cash flow model) for all your stock investments, and hence relative valuation as an approach to picking stocks too is well accepted and widely prevalent.\nWhen you decide to buy or sell a stock based on its PE or P\/B or EV\/EBITDA or EV\/Revenue or even EV\/subscriber ratios, you are engaging in the art of relative valuation. And it\u2019s totally fine to be an investor relying on relative valuation to make your savings work for you, provided you approach it the right way and ensure adequate risk management. In relative valuation, the broader you assess the valuation, ie assess valuation multiple against more parameters, the better the perspective you get.\nIn simple words, one way to understand the difference between absolute valuation (explained in last week\u2019s edition) and relative valuation is this \u2013 absolute valuation is made up of an interesting story that is backed by credible and validated numbers, while relative valuation is made up of an interesting number backed by a credible and validated story.\nWhat are those numbers in relative valuation? Every number in relative valuation is the result of a number A divided by a number B. For example, PE is price of the stock divided by its earnings. These are all numbers that are used to compare against similar metrics of other stocks and assess the merits of the stock.\nBefore we proceed on using relative valuation to pick stocks, it is important to understand that you can do relative valuation using equity multiples or firm\/enterprise multiples.\nEquity multiples\nIf you check the balance sheet of any company, the liabilities side is primarily made up of two line items \u2014 shareholder funds and borrowings. To the contrary, a Profit and Loss statement has many line items \u2014 starting with revenue, followed by variable costs and then fixed costs and taxes. The only claim that equity shareholders have for distribution or for appropriation amongst themselves is what is left after paying the taxes \u2014 net profit.\nSo, if you are doing relative valuation based on equity multiples, it is important to ensure you divide the equity \u2013 ie price per share or market cap of the company by line items that apply to equity shareholders.\nBased on this, there are only 3 items that can be attributed to equity shareholders \u2014 net profit from P&L statement, book value or shareholder funds from the Balance Sheet, and the free cash flows to equity (FCFE) from the cash flow statement. Any relative valuation multiples will be linked to these three items one way or the other. Any other metric could be wrong and misleading.\nFor example, price by revenue or price by EBITDA is incorrect. Why? How do you differentiate between two companies A and B \u2014 both having same market cap of \u20b9100 and similar in all means except for debt levels \u2014 same revenue (\u20b9100) and same gross margin and same EBITDA margins of 20 per cent and thus same EBITDA of \u20b920. But A has zero debt, while B has debt of \u20b910. Since revenue or sales and EBITDA are same, if you do a market cap\/revenue or Price \/Sales, or marketcap\/EBITDA, both companies will have the same valuation.\nHowever, let\u2019s assume depreciation is \u20b910, interest cost is 10 per cent and taxes are zero. This means the net profit of A is \u20b910, while that of B is \u20b99. Thus although both companies are similar in terms of Price\/Revenue and Price\/EBITDA, A is cheaper on the PE ratio \u2013 ie PE of A is 10 and PE of B is 11.1. On a relative valuation basis, you must choose A instead of B, but you would not have spotted it if you had used incorrect metrics.\nHence it\u2019s very important to use the right multiples. When it comes to equity metrics, it always has to be price or market cap (or variations of the same) in numerator divided by line items attributable to equity holders (or variations of the same)\nThe accompanying table gives the commonly used equity multiples for relative valuation.\nOnce the metrics and importance are understood, there are, as such, no limits to how you can use them to pick stocks. You can use one or two metrics or a combination of many more metrics to assess which stocks are undervalued or overvalued.\nDepending on specific cases, you can use further variations to pick stocks. For example, during the 2003-2007 bull market, many textile stocks, for instance, Bombay Dyeing, turned out to be multibaggers. Was their textile business booming? Not really. But the stocks were zooming because there was real estate boom and many textile mills had manufacturing facilities in prime real estate locations. So the markets started to factor value of the company based on market value of their land. In such a case you can deviate from Price\/Book multiple to price\/market value of net assets (assets \u2013 net debt).\nSimilar is the case with holding companies. If you think there is a reasonable case for underlying value of assets to be unlocked and Holdco discount to shrink, like it has happened in bank holding companies in the last 2-3 years, then there is a case to move beyond book value to market value.\nEnterprise value multiples\nEnterprise value refers to total value of a company\/business. This total value as perceived by the market is represented by the sum of its market cap + net debt (includes minority interest). What works in the case of EV is that it helps in doing a capital-agnostic analysis of a company. Whether a company is funded only with equity, or a combination of equity and debt, the total value of the business is the same. Sources of funding don\u2019t matter.\nUsing EV, the value of equity (share price) is derived from the value of the business. Since the capital structure of companies varies significantly, an EV approach enables valuing them on similar terms. One can arrive at the value of the business first and then subtract net debt, to arrive at the equity value. The advantage with EV-based metrics is that you have more options to value a company.\nBear in mind, valuation accuracy is better the lower down the P&L and cash flow statement one can get to. But there are many times when company profits are low, but its operational performance ie EBITDA is not bad. In such cases, as revenue and EBITDA continue to grow, operating leverage will result in PE growing much faster than the above two line items.\nFor example, take the case of Bharti Airtel: at the start of FY22 (April \u201821) its trailing PE was negative\/invalid due to losses in FY21. The stock would have been avoided if one went by PE alone. However, on trailing EV\/EBITDA basis, it was trading at 10 times EV\/EBITDA. When this was considered against its estimated next 2 years EBITDA CAGR of over 20 per cent, the valuation, combined with qualitative factors, made it an interesting buy. Since then, net profits have improved substantially as operating leverage played out.\nAt bl.portfolio we had recommended a buy on the stock based on this in April 2021 and the stock has returned 80 per cent since. The stock would have been easily missed if PE was the metric used to spot the performers.\nHence EV-based metrics are options to consider as well when equity-based valuation multiples do not give a clear picture. Where even EBITDA multiples are not clear, as was the case with many new-age company IPOs that were reporting losses even at the EBITDA level, investors have no option but to go further up the P&L to metrics like EV\/revenue, or even outside of P&L to use metrics like EV\/subscriber.\nAs we mentioned earlier, relative valuation represents a number backed by a credible and well-validated story. Hence, you can use non-P&L multiples. So when you compare companies and invest in one based on EV\/Subscriber, there must be a credible story backing future monetisation of the subscriber in a profitable manner. But do bear in mind, the risks are higher and so may be the rewards or pain as the case may be. When the risks are higher, you must apply a higher margin of safety before choosing the stock.\nAnother thing to bear in mind when it comes to EV-based valuation \u2014 any change in EV will impact only the equity value. For example, if EV of a company is \u20b9100 and it has \u20b950 in debt, then the value of its equity is \u20b950. In this case, if you think EV can increase by 10 per cent, the value of equity will increase by 20 per cent, and the reverse is also true. The higher the leverage, more the impact of change in EV on the value of the stock (both ways).\nKeep a weather eye on Ketchup Economics\nGiven the fact that relative valuation is based on comparison with peer multiples, investors must take measures to check whether the peer multiples are reasonable as well. An overvalued peer cannot be used to justify expensive valuation in one stock. This is what economist Larry Summers termed as Ketchup economists\/economics. It was his sarcastic take on some of the highly paid economists and finance professionals who are concerned only with inter-relationships between prices of different financial assets. Based on this approach, they conclude whether the price of an asset independently is efficient or not. If two bottles of ketchup sell for twice as much as one bottle (except for minor differences traceable to transaction costs), the market is efficient.\nThe risk in this \u2013 it ignores the aspect of whether one bottle of ketchup is priced rationally. Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman once explained how the US housing bubble that precipitated the global financial crisis reminded him of ketchup economists. Before purchasing a house during the bubble, buyers carefully compared prices with \u2018prices of other houses\u2019, but ignored whether the overall level of a home price made sense.\nHow to avoid pitfalls\nSo, what can you do to avoid pitfalls while using relative valuation? Here are a few pointers.\nOne, after comparing stocks based on relative valuation, you can do more layers of comparison by assessing how their valuation fares relative to growth prospects. This apart, many other factors can justify different valuations. For example, TCS has always commanded a valuation premium to peer stocks like Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech because of its superior margins and much more consistent growth. So just because the other stocks are cheaper on PE basis does not mean they are cheap compared to TCS. So you can also do one more layer of comparison by assessing each company\u2019s valuation against its long-term (5-10 years) mean and median valuations and assess how they fare relative to their own history.\nTwo, equity valuations do not function in a silo. Investors have many options \u2014 fixed deposits, bonds, real estate, etc. When other assets get more attractive one must assess scope for valuation change in equities as well. For example, interest rates and bond yields in many developed markets, including the US, are at their highest levels since 2007. This means investors may have to assess current valuations not just against last 10 years\u2019 valuations, but of prior periods as well.\nWhy? Near zero interest rates and low bond yields made stocks with earnings yield of mere 1-2 per cent attractive for an FPI \u2014 for example stocks such as Asian Paints, Nestle India and ABB India which today trade at PE of 65, 83 and 85 times respectively. This implies earnings yield of 1.5 per cent for Asian Paints and 1.2 per cent for Nestle and ABB. Such earnings yields of these stocks were fine for FPIs to hold when compared to zero interest income in their domestic market. But now, with US bond yields offering 5 per cent, these may not be so attractive even when considering the growth prospects. While Indian interest rates were always higher, investors in equities benefited from the global investors\u2019 hunger for yields. That advantage is diminishing today. This is not a recommendation on the stocks, but pointers on factors to consider to make your relative valuation process more foolproof.\nWith discipline and experience, the process will keep getting better.\n\nThis article was published by Business Line on 2023-10-14 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":418}

Theaters nationwide brace for impact","context":"## Taylor Swift has already sold over $100 million of tickets for her concert movie. Theaters nationwide brace for impact\n\nGreg Marcus has been in the movie business for years but he never expected to be urging moviegoers to take out their phones during a film \u2014 let alone to be crafting friendship bracelets in preparation for an opening weekend.\nBut there the chief executive and chair of the Marcus Corporation is in a promotion for his theater chain headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, stringing beads together while humming \u201cShake It Off.\u201d\nMovie theaters are readying for an onslaught like they\u2019ve never seen before, beginning Friday when \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d debuts. The concert film, compiled from several Swift shows at Southern California\u2019s SoFi Stadium, is expected to launch with $100 million, or possibly more. Advance ticket sales worldwide have already surpassed $100 million.\nSwifties will descend. Dancing will be encouraged.\n\u201cThis is different,\u201d says Marcus. \u201cTake your phone out. Take selfies. Dance, sing, get up, have a good time. We want to create an atmosphere.\u201d\nConcert films, of course, aren\u2019t anything new. Just last month, the Talking Heads classic \u201cStop Making Sense\u201d returned to theaters for a decades-later encore. But \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d heralds something new and potentially game-changing in the movie industry.\nTwo of the biggest stars on the planet \u2014 Swift and , in December under a very similar arrangement, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 are heading into cinemas in first-of-their-kind deals made directly with AMC Theaters that circumvent Hollywood studios and which, for now, leave streamers waiting on the sidelines.\nBut how did the once declared-for-dead multiplex become the go-to place this fall a pair of stars previously at home on Netflix?\nWhen studios began diverting some of their titles to streaming platforms, movie theaters began thinking harder about how they could fill their screens \u2014 a question exacerbated this autumn by an actors strike that\u2019s led to the postponement of big releases like \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d\nMovie theaters are increasingly not just a marquee of movie showtimes but a big-screen stage for a variety of visual media. BTS earlier this year released a concert film, with higher ticket prices and limited showtimes. The Metropolitan Opera has for years done popular live broadcasts in theaters.\nFew acts can do what Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 can. Their expected success is unlikely to be replicated. But \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d could be the start of an expansion of what, exactly, a movie theater can be. Think the Sphere, only much cheaper and in most towns.\n\u201cYou could say we\u2019re in the movie business, but really we\u2019re in the getting-together-with-other-people business,\u201d says Marcus. \u201cThe more we do of it, the more the customers will think about it and the more talent will go: This is something I could do.\u201d\nSwift\u2019s camp was motivated to get the film out even as her stadium tour continues internationally. The tour, which is projected by Pollstar to gross some $1.4 billion, crashed Ticketmaster\u2019s site, saw sky-high resale mark-ups and left many fans priced out.\nThe movie, directed by Sam Wrench, would be a way for millions more to experience the Eras Tour. Adult tickets are being sold for $19.89, a reference to her birth year and 2014 album, a re-recording of which is due out Oct. 27. That\u2019s higher than the average movie ticket but several thousand less than many tickets to see Swift live.\nIt\u2019s arriving uncommonly fast, too, just a little over two months since the SoFi shows. Speed was one reason Swift\u2019s father, Scott Swift, is said to have sought out a direct deal with AMC. Swift produced the film, herself, and, with 274 million followers on Instagram, didn\u2019t need a studio to promote it.\nThe pop star\u2019s apparent relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has only further brightened the spotlight on the movie. According to ad tracking firm iSpot, TV ads for the film ran only a few dozen times as of Oct. 6, including several spots during NFL broadcasts. (A Marvel movie, by comparison, might run several thousand TV commercials.)\nTicket sales will be split 43% with theaters and 57% shared by Swift and AMC \u2014 with the lion\u2019s share of that going to Swift. The film will play exclusively in theaters for at least 13 weeks \u2014 longer than many Hollywood releases do now. AMC CEO Adam Aron has called the deal \u201ca coup for AMC\u201d on social media.\nBoth AMC and representatives for Swift declined to discuss the film\u2019s release.\nAfter a premiere in Los Angeles on Wednesday, there won\u2019t be any advance screenings until the movie begins playing at 6 p.m. local time Friday. Most wide-release movies open with Thursday showings and Friday daytime screenings. It\u2019s another wrinkle in a nontraditional release that\u2019s challenging Hollywood norms.\n\u201cInnovation comes out of challenging times in this business. We\u2019re seeing a lot of changes, some subtle, some not so subtle,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. \u201cIt seems like, right now, there are no rules when it comes to being successful.\u201d\nDergarabedian believes the two concert films should help lift the North American box office to more than $9 billion in 2023, up from the $7.4 billion of last year and edging closer to the $11.4 billion of 2019.\n\u201cIt really opens up the idea that other types of content can play really well in a movie theater,\u201d he says.\nSome of those changes have been facilitated by the abolishment of long-held antitrust restrictions governing movie distribution. After more than 70 years of regulating divisions between exhibition and distribution, the Paramount consent decrees were terminated in 2020 at the urging of the Department of Justice, with a two-year sunset period that ran until last year.\n\u201cInnovation had effectively been stunted,\u201d says Makan Delrahim, the former antitrust chief at the Justice Department who proposed ending the consent decrees.\nDelrahim believes \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d \u2014 as a movie distributed by a theater chain, with nontraditional ticket prices \u2014 could \u201cfuel new business models to save the exhibitors.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be more appetite to experiment different models for theatrical distribution,\u201d Delrahim says. \u201cThe industry needs it and, frankly, so do consumers.\u201d\nMeanwhile, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d is poised to become the biggest concert film ever in about two days of release. Not accounting for inflation, 2011\u2019s \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never\u201d holds that mark with $73.1 million across its entire run. Accounting for inflation, it will be harder for \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d to catch \u201cWoodstock,\u201d which grossed $50 million in 1970, a total that translates to nearly $400 million today.\nIn Marcus\u2019 theaters, like many other chains, there will be friendship bracelet stations. Sound systems have been modified for more of a concert feel. And while Marcus grants it will be strange to see an AMC logo before a film playing in his theaters, he doesn\u2019t particularly mind.\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy it\u2019s there,\u201d he says.\n\nThis article, authored by Jake Coyle, The Associated Press, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-10 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":419}
