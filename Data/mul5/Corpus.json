{"title":"Shohei Ohtani rumors tracker: Latest news, updates on free agent's MLB future","context":"## Shohei Ohtani rumors tracker: Latest news, updates on free agent's MLB future\n\nThe Hot Stove dominoes have started to fall, but everyone who loves baseball \u2014 fans, players, coaches, front-office types and everyone else \u2014 is waiting for free agent Shohei Ohtani\u2019s decision. Where will the global superstar sign his next contract?\nHe\u2019s played his entire six-year MLB career with the Angels, but his teams haven\u2019t even sniffed the postseason and Ohtani\u2019s made his desire to win crystal clear, so he won\u2019t be back. Will he chase every dollar possible, going solely by the highest offer? That seems unlikely, too. Remember, Ohtani wants to win.\nLots of teams can meet Ohtani in that middle ground, offering both lots of money \u2014 he will absolutely sign the largest contract in baseball history \u2014 and lots of chances to compete for a World Series title (or two or three). It\u2019s a long list.\nMORE: Ranking 15 possible destinations for Shoehei Ohtani\nSo, the baseball world waits for news. We have been promised very little of that, though. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Passan reported this: \u201cIf visits between Ohtani and a team are reported publicly, it will be held against the team.\u201d\nSo, yeah. Probably won\u2019t hear a ton, but that won\u2019t stop the speculation. And it won\u2019t stop us from passing along what precious few nuggets that are scattered about.\nMORE: Way-too-early MLB Power Rankings for 2024\nShohei Ohtani free agent rumors and updates\nOhtani has an 'affinity' for Boston, it seems\nDate: Nov. 27\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\nHope everyone enjoyed the Thanksgiving holiday. Us baseball writers are pleased that Ohtani didn't decide to sign while the turkey was still warm. This isn't exactly \"breaking news\" because rumors have been swirling, but it's an aside from an in-the-know reporter that just might give one fan base a little too much hope and excitement.\nPassan wrote a piece about 10 teams to watch the rest of the offseason, and he threw this little note in the section about the Red Sox, and how they needed to sign Yoshinobu Yamamoto.\nBoston's bats are good, or good enough at least, to avoid having to spend like mad in a down year for free agent hitters -- unless, of course, it's for Ohtani, who has an affinity for Boston. If the Red Sox don't hit that jackpot, they're backfilled nicely with a system that includes outfielder Roman Anthony, shortstop Marcelo Mayer and catcher Kyle Teel, among the best trios of offensive prospects in baseball.\nIt's cool when the best player in the world is a free agent and has an \"affinity\" for your town.\n'Money's great, but winning's better'\nDate: Nov. 21\nSource: Max Scherzer, Rangers pitcher on Foul Territory\nOK, so this isn't necessarily a rumor, but an example of how much players would love for Ohtani to join their team. Scherzer was a guest on Foul Territory on Monday.\n\"Money's great, but winning's better.\"\n\nMax Scherzer shares his pitch for Shohei Ohtani to join the @Rangers \ud83c\udfc6\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f https:\/\/t.co\/6KoSRqSgk2 pic.twitter.com\/PHW2jHWj6C \u2014 Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 20, 2023\nMaybe Ohtani won\u2019t sign quite so soon after all\nDate: Nov. 20\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic\nBuried at the bottom of Rosenthal\u2019s piece on what an Ohtani contract might look like \u2014 incentives, opt-outs and all sorts of stuff \u2014 is this little bit of reporting:\nAn agreement at the winter meetings in Nashville the first week of December would be the ideal outcome for MLB, but not necessarily for Ohtani. He perhaps will be better off waiting for the signing of Japanese righty Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who is expected to be posted for free agency as soon as Monday, triggering a 45-day window for teams to negotiate with him. Losing out on the 25-year-old Yamamoto, who could command more than $200 million, might put certain teams on tilt, improving the landscape for Ohtani.\nInteresting, certainly.\nMariners out of the Ohtani chase?\nDate: Nov. 17\nSource: Daniel Kramer, MLB.com\nHere\u2019s the key piece of the article: \u201cIndustry sources told MLB.com this week that landing Ohtani doesn\u2019t appear to be within the Mariners\u2019 realistic agenda this offseason.\u201d\nIn a way, that\u2019s surprising. The Mariners seem to check a lot of boxes for Ohtani. They\u2019re set up to win for a long time with a bunch of young starting pitchers and a co-superstar in Julio Rodriguez. Plus, Ohtani would get to be part of the quest for the franchise\u2019s first World Series title, he\u2019d get to wear the same uniform as his baseball hero, Ichiro, and he\u2019s lived there in the offseason. So it must be about the money, and Seattle\u2019s reluctance to even get in the conversation. That\u2019s gotta be super disappointing for Mariners fans starved for a title, right?\nOn the other hand, maybe the M\u2019s know all about Ohtani\u2019s desire to keep the rumor mill quiet, and leaking \u201cnews\u201d like this would please Ohtani and his camp.\n\u2018Timing could be right for a Cubs-Ohtani union\u2019\nDate: Nov. 16\nSource: Jesse Rogers, ESPN\nThe Cubs were one of the seven finalists for Ohtani the first time around, but lack of the DH in the NL at the time made it hard for Ohtani to choose Chicago. His primary goal was showing he could both hit and pitch at a high level for an MLB team, and trying to play the outfield instead of just DHing would have been too much, even for Ohtani.\nNow, though? The NL has the DH, and the Cubs are itching to make a sport-shaking signing. Well, another sport-shaking signing. They already poached Craig Counsell from the rival Brewers to be their new manager, and it would be shocking if they didn\u2019t make a corresponding player-acquisition move. Ohtani\u2019s at the top of the list.\nOhtani could potentially sign before Winter Meetings\nDate: Nov. 11\nSource: Alden Gonzalez, ESPN\nPretty much everyone in baseball would LOVE for this to happen. The team that winds up signing him, of course, will kick the Ohtani hype machine into gear ASAP. Not only is there merchandise to sell, but the front office will use that signing to help lure other potential free agents, maybe even for a \u201cplay with Ohtani\u201d discount. But even for the other teams, knowing that Ohtani is off the board relatively soon into the offseason would allow them to shift to other priorities, like trading for Juan Soto or deciding which free-agent pitchers to pursue with the money that might have been earmarked for Ohtani.\n\nThis article, authored by Ryan Fagan, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-27 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":480}

(Photo by Sean Gardner\/Getty Images)\nRyan Blaney\u2019s recent championship victory in his Ford Mustang at the NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race was a moment of pride and celebration for Ford. However, it\u2019s not just about winning the races or championships for the manufacturer. It\u2019s about marketing and maintaining their brand loyalty, as a Ford insider reveals.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nLast Sunday, Ryan Blaney secured his first-ever championship by skillfully maneuvering his Ford Mustang to victory at Phoenix. He held off the late challenges from Chevrolet drivers Kyle Larson and William Byron. This achievement marks a significant moment for Ford and its NASCAR program, as it made a clean sweep by winning championships in Truck, Xfinity, and Cup Series.\nMark Rushbrook reveals the vehicle NASCAR fans prefer to buy from Ford\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn the post-race media conference, Mark Rushbrook, the Global Director for Ford Performance, was asked if winning the championship has any significance for the manufacturer as a whole in terms of marketing the brand globally.\nMark Rushbrook emphasized the importance of winning with the Mustang from a global marketing perspective. He stated, \u201cYeah, winning is everything for us, just as a point of pride. It\u2019s certainly going to be a celebration in Dearborn. My phone has been blowing up with Ford family members and our senior executives already so excited about it. It means a lot internally to the customer because motorsports is so important to us.\u201d\nRushbrook highlighted that success on the racetrack is the foundation of successful marketing programs. Winning races and championships builds credibility with fans and encourages them to engage with the brand. He explained, \u201cThat is the basis for successful marketing programs; it is success on the racetrack. So you have to win the races, you have to win championships to have that credibility, and for fans to engage with your brand and make them proud to have a Ford parked in their driveway or in their garage.\u201d\nWhile Ford\u2019s racing program, featuring the Mustang, certainly boosts the sale of this iconic sports car, the Ford insider dropped an interesting fact. Rushbrook revealed, \u201cFor us, NASCAR, even though we\u2019re racing a Mustang, we certainly sell Mustangs because of it. But we sell more F-150s to NASCAR fans. This is a proof point for them.\u201d\nThe Ford F-150 truck, known for its ruggedness and reliability, has garnered a dedicated following among NASCAR enthusiasts. Winning the championship is not only about showcasing the Mustang but also the Ford-150, with which Ben Rhodes won his second Truck Series championship on Friday. This is also a testament to the power of NASCAR in influencing car-buying decisions.\nFord\u2019s global marketing strategy also leverages the success of the Mustang in NASCAR, utilizing it as a marketing tool to promote their road cars worldwide. As the seventh generation Mustang continues to be sold globally as a road car, it\u2019s racing not only in NASCAR but also in various international series, including Australia Supercars, Mustang GT3, Mustang GT4, and Dark Horse R with a Spec Challenge.\nIn essence, Ford takes the benefits from any Mustang\u2019s racing success and uses it to market their cars globally. It\u2019s a win-win situation for both the brand and racing enthusiasts. Although, all this might not have come to pass were it not for a timely intervention by \u201cThe Captain.\u201d\nRoger Penske played a big part in calming Ryan Blaney down in the clutch moment of the race\nIn the heat of the championship race at Phoenix, Ryan Blaney\u2019s competitive spirit almost got the best of him. He was racing for the championship and was eager to secure the lead from Ross Chastain in the closing few laps. However, he was also aware that he needed to maintain his position to win the title.\nWatch This Story | Star Wars Saga: Bubba Wallace\u2019s Galactic Surprise for Ryan Blaney\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn the post-race conference, the Team Penske driver expressed his frustration, stating, \u201cThere is no secret that I can snap on the radio. That\u2019s been my whole life. That\u2019s been my whole career. It\u2019s just kind of something I do.\u201d He described the intense battle with Ross Chastain, who blocked him multiple times, making it a tough fight.\nThe final push came when Blaney made contact with Chastain. A move made out of frustration, as he admitted. But at this crucial moment, team owner Roger Penske, often referred to as \u201cThe Captain,\u201d stepped in. He reminded Blaney that he was not racing against Chastain but against the HMS duo. Penske\u2019s calming influence helped Blaney regain composure, ensuring that he didn\u2019t take any unnecessary risks. The result? A championship for Ryan Blaney and another testament to the guidance of \u201cThe Captain\u201d in high-pressure situations.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn NASCAR, it\u2019s not just about speed and strategy; it\u2019s also about maintaining composure under intense pressure.

However, Bedard helped set up a Ryan Donato goal in the middle frame to get the Blackhawks on the board, picking up his first NHL point in the process.\nIn the third period, Cole Guttman potted the equalizer for Chicago early in the frame. With less than five minutes left in regulation, Jason Dickinson fired home a shot from the slot that gave Chicago its first lead of the night. A Nick Foligno empty net goal sealed the deal for the Blackhawks.\nBedard was as advertised in his NHL debut. The Chicago rookie led all players on his club in shots on goal, recording five in his first game on 11 shot attempts. His 21:29 time on ice was second to only Seth Jones, as Chicago head coach Luke Richardson did not hold the 18-year-old back. He did struggle in the faceoff dot, winning just two of 13 draws, but it was a strong first impression at the NHL level.\nFor the Penguins, the third period struggles from last season have seemingly carried over to start this year. Last year, Pittsburgh finished tied for the most losses after taking a lead into the third period. The crew followed that trend on Tuesday night, letting a 2-1 lead to start the final frame slip away.\nBedard and the Blackhawks are back in action on national TV tomorrow, as Chicago heads to Boston for a Wednesday night date with the Bruins.\nMORE: Watch Blackhawks vs. Penguins live on Fubo (free trial)\nThe Sporting News provided updates and highlights from Connor Bedard's NHL debut in the Blackhawks vs. Penguins game.\nBlackhawks vs. Penguins score\n1 2 3 F Blackhawks 0 1 3 4 Penguins 1 1 0 2\nBlackhawks vs. Penguins live updates, highlights from Connor Bedard's NHL debut\nAll times Eastern\nFinal: Blackhawks 4, Penguins 2\n10:50 p.m. \u2014 The Blackhawks score four unanswered goals to come from behind and take down the Penguins on opening night.

{"title":"Ole Miss vs. Georgia live score, updates, highlights from Week 11 college football game","context":"## Ole Miss vs. Georgia live score, updates, highlights from Week 11 college football game\n\nThe SEC East champs put on a show, to say the least. Georgia dominated against ninth-ranked Ole Miss, coming up with a 52-17 win to earn a date with Alabama in the SEC Championship Game in December. All-American tight end Brock Bowers returned to the field for his final homestead only 26 days after TightRope surgery. Starting against the Rebels, he had three catches for 34 yards, adding a touchdown in the fourth quarter. He missed just two games after suffering the high ankle sprain against Vanderbilt on Oct. 14. Georgia didn't need him, though, as the running backs had themselves a night for both teams. Kendall Milton and Daijun Edwards scored two touchdowns each as the Bulldogs finished with 300 rushing yards. Milton ended the night with a career-high 127 yards. For Ole Miss, Quinshon Judkins scored the only two touchdowns and finished with 75 yards. Unfortunately for Rebels, injury continues to plague them after Micah Pettus, the team's top lineman, was ruled out with a broken foot bone he sustained during practice. Quarterback Jaxson Dart left the game at the end of the third quarter after a hit from two Georgia defenders. He held his collarbone as he entered the injury tent. He was taken back to the locker room for further examination and did not return to the game, leaving it in the hands of Spencer Sanders. Before his exit, Dart passed for 112 yards and one interception. Sanders finished it up with 61 yards on four completions. For the Dawgs, Carson Beck finished with 306 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. It's the fourth game this season with over 300 yards and at least two touchdowns. In its trip to the SEC Championship for the third-straight year, Georgia will face Alabama, who it lost to in 2021. A dominant win over the Rebels surely inspires some confidence with two regular season games left.

Interest-rate sensitive sectors, including REITS and consumer companies, were among the weakest on the local bourse as investors digested the news.\nGSFM investment strategist Stephen Miller said the inflation data, taken with the October Reserve Bank board meeting minutes, which revealed the board had \u201clow tolerance for a slower return of inflation to target than currently expected\u201d, made the possibility of an interest rate rise from the central bank in November a \u201cnear certainty\u201d.

{"title":"Israel thwarts Hamas on the financial battlefield","context":"## Israel thwarts Hamas on the financial battlefield\n\nTwo weeks into the war, the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA) received secret intelligence information from two European countries that warned: \"A large, well-known organization is raising funds for Hamas through posts on social networks, and fintech company platforms outside Israel, under the guise of donations to Gaza residents.\" The information included the name of the organization, its fundraising methods, and the identity of the entities behind it. Their concern was that, within days, the millions of dollars raised would go directly to the military arm of Hamas. In a swift joint international action, at IMPA\u2019s request, one of the European countries blocked the organization\u2019s money pipeline by immediately freezing its financial activities.\n\"We are talking about a matter of minutes here. From the moment the authorities in Europe received the information, and we requested the money be blocked, with no court orders or delay, they blocked the transfer of millions of dollars to one of the most active organizations, and from it to Hamas. This is a real-time deterrence,\" reveals IMPA director general Adv. Ilit Ostrovitch-Levi. \"And then there was a domino effect. Following this blocking, more countries began to look around, and blocked funds intended for terror. All this information, which is now shared at an international level, leads to the closing of more and more Hamas funding pipelines, in real time. With worldwide cooperation, Israel\u2019s security and enforcement authorities are thwarting the transfer of millions of dollars earmarked for terrorism, every day.\"\nHeaded by Ostrovitch-Levi since May 2022, IMPA is an intelligence body that conducts the most complex of international economic investigations, and fights terror financing routinely. On October 7, Ostrovitch-Levi received a painful reminder of the vital importance of her work. \"Already on that Saturday night, with Israeli under heavy rocket fire, we talked about preparing ourselves for the campaign we\u2019re now entering, the fight against terror financing channels. Dozens of our staff have been called up to reserve duty, in large part managers working regularly in the fight against terror financing.\"\nSince then, most of IMPA\u2019s work has focused on identifying and blocking the terror money pipelines. \"We work very reactively - we see a fundraising campaign, try to deter it, and stop it from happening again. There are no breaks, because they are constantly active. It\u2019s a daily struggle. Our analysts have been sitting on the social networks from day two of the war, just manually monitoring visible sources of information on these networks to locate fundraising campaigns for terrorist organizations operating in Gaza.\"\nThree days after the war began, IMPA also issued a call to all global regulated entities for increased vigilance towards terrorism financing campaigns in response to the ongoing war and state of emergency, and to report all activities that raise suspicion of terror support and terror financing, in an effective and immediate manner.\nRELATED ARTICLES Tech experts battle to shut down Gaza financial pipeline\n\"Overnight, we started receiving hundreds of reports about unusual activity by customers of financial institutions in the State of Israel,\" she says. Before October 7, IMPA received about 100 reports a day dealing with terror financing. That number jumped to about 1,000. \"There is a 900% increase in reports on terror financing, and we don't waste time, everything happens very, very quickly. As we receive the information, we simultaneously pass it on to the operational professionals who locate the money pipelines, and block them. Some information will not necessarily lead to terror financing, but we don\u2019t have time to waste. Bank CEOs call and draw our attention to the information they convey to us that warrants special attention.\"\nHas information from banks and financial institutions led to blocking the money pipeline for terrorism?\n\"There was very high-quality intelligence that we passed on to the security agencies. We don't always know the results.\"\n\"Gaza could be more beautiful than Dubai \"\nThe network to block terror financing funds includes many entities, including private citizens. \"The world's financial intelligence authorities are now at the heart of this struggle, and we\u2019re working together to thwart the financing channels that we\u2019ve located. In addition, we\u2019ve been approached by many experts from the private sector; people with intelligence experience because they\u2019ve worked in these organizations, or have high-tech experience, and have mobilized like crazy. Israeli entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley have contacted us; they write code, search for information, and give us lots of information. We aggregate and examine everything.\"\nIMPA is charged with rooting out the sources of funding for terrorism, working together with the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel (NBCTF) in the Ministry of Defense, which is the coordinating body of all activities to thwart terror financing, the Shin Bet, Military Intelligence Directorate (AMAN), and all other relevant intelligence and security agencies. \"The most significant way to finance terrorism is to finance countries, not fundraising campaigns. These have intensified greatly over the last month, but the core of the budget - for Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad is Iran, in particular the Quds Force (the special forces of the IRGC, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). Hamas has all kinds of additional sources of self-financing, including businesses, associations, investments, and all kinds of arrangements they\u2019ve tried to set up over the years. They need state funding, and without Iran they have no ability to exist.\"\nHow much money does Iran transfer to Hamas?\n\"As far as we know, the budget from Iran to Gaza is in the order of $100 million a year. Gaza could do very nice things with this money, make it even more beautiful than Dubai. But from what we know, most of this budget goes to the military wing of Hamas.\"\nQatar also transfers money to Hamas.\n\"Qatar transferred suitcases of cash to Gaza through Israel. Everyone knows this. This money allegedly went to pay salaries and civilian needs (education, health, infrastructure), and therefore Israel transferred it, so it\u2019s incorrect to say that it all went to fund terrorism.\"\nFrom money-changers to chocolate\nHow have these billions reached the Gaza street, and Hamas over the years? There are quite a few methods, including cryptocurrencies and trade. But the main and easiest method for money transfer to Gaza is hawala.\nOstrovitch-Levi explains, \"Most of the money does not reach Gaza physically through the border crossings, but via hawala, a financial channel that is based on trust and connections, and enables the transfer and exchange of funds between countries, without the cash physically passing through them. It\u2019s a channel for transferring the funds raised in other countries. In Gaza there are all sorts of wealthy individuals who can transfer large amounts in cash to Hamas upon receiving request from entities abroad.\"\nHow does the method work?\n\"Money changers in places all over the world, let's say Turkey, receive money, and inform the hawaladars (money changers) in Gaza who transfer the money on their behalf. When a customer comes to a hawaladar in Turkey and asks to transfer money to Gaza, he does not physically transfer money, but settles accounts internally with money changers in Gaza, and Judea and Samaria. The funds are de facto not transferred. Occasionally, or when the amount of the debt reaches a predetermined ceiling, a transfer is made between the money changers to reset the outstanding debt.\"\nIs it possible detect the money pipeline between hawaladars and halt the transfer?\n\"Transfers are made between two \u2018exchangers,\u2019 and don\u2019t include the identity of the beneficiaries, or the persons who gave the money. They don\u2019t know what the transactions were, they only know there are debts to offset. We are in a constant battle against this phenomenon. In recent years, Israeli authorities have designated several currency service providers in Gaza as conduits facilitating the transfer tens of millions of dollars a year to terrorist organizations in Gaza.\"\nAnother way to transfer money is trade. Transferring goods, or inflating their value. For example, only days ago, containers of goods worth hundreds of thousands of shekels were seized at Ashdod Port, which were destined for Hamas merchants in Nablus and other cities, with the proceeds intended to go on to finance Hamas operations. Another example is the 23 tons of chocolate bars that were seized in August 2021 in a joint operation by the NBCTF, AMAN, and the Tax Authority at the Nitzana Border Crossing between Israel and Egypt. It was suspected that the snack bars, destined for Gaza, were purchased with terror financing funds, with the proceeds from their sales earmarked for Hamas.\nAnother affair that was uncovered, combined trade and hawala. Hamas funds originating in Iran, which were transferred in cash to money changers in Turkey for transfer to Gaza. At the same time Hamed al-Khachari, a Gazan money changer who worked for Hamas (who was assassinated by Israel in 2019), located Gazan merchants who imported goods from Turkish companies and owned payment on the goods. They paid cash to Khachari, who transferred the money to Hamas in Gaza. Meanwhile, the money changers in Turkey received funds from Hamas abroad that were used to pay the Turkish companies.\nHamas is already preparing for \"the day after\"\nAlthough it has been almost impossible to transfer money and goods to Gaza since October 7, with hawala shuttered, and no trade, Hamas continues to raise funds. \"The situation in Gaza is known, and nothing can be brought in, but fundraising activity continues in Judea and Samaria. It\u2019s also possible to make bank transfers to Judea and Samaria, and the fundraising activity hasn't stopped, because while the fighting is going on, they\u2019re continuing to fill their reserves for \u2018the day after\u2019 [the war]. We realize they\u2019re raising funds for their continued operations. Hamas is taking advantage of the current sympathy for the Gazans\u2019 situation, and is using online platforms, both of organizations whose business is crowdfunding, and also through the creation of fictitious projects to raise funds: throw-pillows, jewelry and whatnot, and more.\"\nAll this happens openly, for all to see, in Europe, and other places around the world. \"Hamas and Islamic Jihad carry out recruitment operations under the guise of humanitarian aid campaigns, and use Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok to disseminate their announcements. The facade is always supporting humanitarian goals, but in practice it's about channels for funding individuals and entities connected directly to Hamas or Islamic Jihad.\"\nHowever, IMPA\u2019s goal, Ostrovitch-Levi explains, is not only to stop the individual raising of funds for terror financing, but the entire interrelated chain, from the fund-raiser to the transferrer, and on through to the recipient. \"We have the ability to build the intelligence scenario, synchronize all the sources of information received, and delineate the money trail from abroad to Hamas. We\u2019re interested not only in who is running the campaign, the association or entity, but where the money is coming from, and where it\u2019s going. We need to stop all of the elements in this network.\"\nEver since October 7, everyone has been discussing and analyzing the question of about the intelligence agencies, and why there was no warning. Where was IMPA before?\n\"Hamas collects lots of money all the time, and the security agencies deter money transfers. There was no sudden increase in the raising of billions, and you must also remember that most of the money is raised globally, not in Israel. The hundreds of millions of dollars that Hamas receives have been accumulating for years. We had no possibility of seeing a spike in fundraising towards October 7.\"\n\"We understand the west is next\"\nIMPA is not alone in the fight against terror financing. Three days after the start of the war, Andrea Gacki, Director of the US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) contacted Ostrovitch-Levi to request a meeting. The two met at virtually the same time President Joe Biden met with the families of the hostages. \"She put herself and the entity she heads, one of the most powerful financial intelligence agencies in the world, at our disposal. She said, 'Whatever you want or need, just say the word'\".\nGacki has kept her promise. \"Since that day, we\u2019ve received an unprecedented flow of financial intelligence from the US, unlike anything seen before. They\u2019ve given us valuable information that we\u2019ve passed on to the security agencies, about organizations they didn\u2019t necessarily know about, and people backing them, all in real time. At the same time, they\u2019ve issued alerts to increase vigilance among the US public about terror financing.\"\nOn October 18, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that it had imposed sanctions on 10 key Hamas operatives and financial facilitators in Gaza and elsewhere including Sudan, Turkey, Algeria, and Qatar. The statement read, \"This action targets members managing assets in a secret Hamas investment portfolio, a Qatar-based financial facilitator with close ties to the Iranian regime, a key Hamas commander, and a Gaza-based virtual currency exchange and its operator\u2026 To date, the Treasury has targeted nearly 1,000 individuals and entities connected to terrorism and terrorist financing by the Iranian regime and its proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iran-aligned terrorist groups in the region.\"\nOn October 27, OFAC imposed a second round of sanctions on key Hamas-linked officials and financial networks. The statement read, \"Today\u2019s action targets additional assets in Hamas\u2019s investment portfolio and individuals who are facilitating sanctions evasion by Hamas-affiliated companies. The Treasury is also designating a Hamas official in Iran and members of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), as well as a Gaza-based entity that has served as a conduit for illicit Iranian funds to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).\"\nThe US is not the only one. Europe has also been mobilized in the economic fight against terrorism. \"On the third day of the fighting, my colleagues from the Netherlands and Germany, both veteran heads of their authorities for the prohibition of money laundering, phoned to let me know they wanted to establish an international task force to assist Israel in the fight against the financing of Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, and all terrorist organizations and their satellites. With them and with the US, we established a kind of task force, which is not subject to any country or unifying body, countries that are working in coordination, and meet every few days to exchange intelligence, and advance the struggle.\"\nIn general, following an appeal by IMPA to its counterparts around the world, there has been a dramatic increase in intelligence coming to Israel from abroad. \"The amount of information doubled in the month of fighting, compared with the monthly average. Before the war, we received about 24 intelligence reports a month from parallel authorities, compared with 50 today.\"\nCountries around the world cooperating with Israel to fight terrorism sounds almost ideal, but it\u2019s hard not to wonder where they were before.\n\"Many countries felt this had nothing to do with them, that it wasn\u2019t their struggle. The international and US mobilization, the task force we founded, the fact that the financial sector abroad suddenly wants to accept the Israeli announcements about the terror entities and people involved, receive intelligence from Israel, and cooperate with us is all only because of October 7. Everyone understands that \u2018The West is next\u2019 isn\u2019t an empty statement. This event is the one to make the countries of the world understand they must fight effectively against terror financing, that they need to block Iran effectively.\"\nIMPA is trying to convey these messages to the member nations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international body to combat money laundering and terror financing. \"We are working very hard on isolating Iran in matters of terror financing. But it\u2019s still a cash economy and it is very, very difficult to stop the financing of Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad. Most of the money comes from oil, but there\u2019s actually an Iranian security system budget dedicated to this.\"\nAnother problem to be dealt with is the addiction to the cash received from the terrorist organizations. \"Because it involves cash in such huge amounts, a situation has arisen in which the populations in Gaza and Lebanon become addicted to financing from Iran. There is internal collapse and a complete disruption of the ability to receive funds another way. This makes terrorism a very profitable business. It destroys the civic structure, unemployment rates rise very high, and being a Hamas operator becomes profitable. It's a vicious circle that feeds on itself. This is an alternative banking system disconnected from the general system. The Iranians are building whole mechanisms to enable intake of this money. This is something bigger than deterring one transfer or another.\"\nCan the current global mobilization alter the fight against terror financing?\n\"Discussions with countries around the world and immediate deterrence are not long-term solutions. Stopping the funds from Iran should be carried out at the international level through FATF, through OFAC sanctions, through sanctions from the entire world. In the end, the solution to Iranian financing are global sanctions. It\u2019s not something that one country can prevent. The bottom line is that without money there is no terrorism, and no matter how hard they try to decapitate the terrorist organizations, as long as they have economic oxygen, as long as the countries of the world do not fight terror financing properly, these organizations will continue to breathe.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on November 19, 2023.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023.\n\nThis article, authored by Ela Levi-Weinrib, was published by Globes English | Israel Business Arena on 2023-11-19 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":486}
{"title":"NASCAR offseason news roundup: Short track testing in Phoenix, new spotters for stars, more moves for 2024","context":"## NASCAR offseason news roundup: Short track testing in Phoenix, new spotters for stars, more moves for 2024\n\nEvery year, the wintertime and the NASCAR offseason is a welcome -- but very short -- respite from what is otherwise a demanding, year-long grind of racing. Come 2024, that grind is soon to begin again, and exactly what it looks like will be based in large part on these months where driver lineups, crew lineups and rules packages are set.\nWith much activity going on within the confines of race shops across NASCAR, here are some major storylines for the week of Dec. 4 as the offseason continues.\nOffseason testing in Phoenix\nOne month after Ryan Blaney was crowned the Cup Series champion and the 2023 season was completed out west, Blaney and a select group of other drivers and teams returned to Phoenix Raceway for a two-day test as NASCAR looked at a number of aerodynamic and technical changes for the Next Gen car. Blaney was one of six drivers to participate in the test, joining Chris Buescher, Erik Jones, Christopher Bell, Kyle Larson and Corey LaJoie.\nThe first day of testing centered around different splitters and diffusers as well as tires engineered to degrade more during green flag runs as NASCAR tries to build upon marginal improvements made to the Next Gen car's short track package in 2023. According to Cole Cusumano, teams ran a simplified diffuser -- featuring just two fins in the middle at a 90-degree angle -- as well as an alternate splitter design.\nAfter ascertaining a direction on aerodynamics and tires, NASCAR spent the second day of the test experimenting with existing mufflers to slightly soften the otherwise deafening noise made by Cup Series motors. Gearbox and shifting changes were not included as part of this test.\nSpeaking to reporters, Blaney noted the biggest difference came in the alternate splitter, which significantly reduced downforce.\n\"It was big. The first laps I had I was like, 'Man, this thing drives way different,'\" Blaney said. \"... It's a massive aero loss when you do that. And then the simple diffuser wasn't as big of a change as the splitter, but it was still something to feel.\"\nThe topic of mufflers -- while anathema to the purest of gearheads -- has been one that has occasionally popped up in the Next Gen era, particularly with NASCAR now using mufflers in urban settings at stadiums (Los Angeles Coliseum) and on street courses (Chicago) where noise ordinances are more of a consideration. Kyle Larson told reporters he did not notice a difference in cockpit cooling with the mufflers tested on Wednesday, but spoke positively of the idea overall.\n\"I definitely think our racecars are way too loud, and probably are still too loud with the mufflers,\" Larson said. \"I think the cars can be quieter just to help the fan experience.\"\nNotable crew changes\nNot one, but two of the biggest stars in NASCAR will have new eyes in the sky in 2024, as the spotters for both Chase Elliott and Ryan Blaney announced they will be stepping down. Eddie D'Hondt announced Saturday he would not return as Elliott's spotter next season, followed Monday by Josh Williams announcing he would step down as Blaney's spotter.\nAccording to Bob Pockrass of Fox Sports, former NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Tim Fedewa, the longtime spotter for Kevin Harvick, will take over as the spotter for Blaney next season. A possible landing spot for Williams exists at Spire Motorsports, as Williams has previously spotted for Zane Smith in the Craftsman Truck Series.\nSpire Motorsports announced a number of personnel moves this week, hiring Stephen Doran as the crew chief for Smith's No. 71 Chevrolet and Luke Lambert as the crew chief of the No. 77 for Carson Hocevar. Doran joins Spire from Stewart-Haas Racing, where he was an engineer on the No. 4 team, while Lambert moves to Spire after being crew chief of the No. 42 at Legacy Motor Club in 2023.\nIn addition, Spire has also hired Doug Duchardt, whose career in racing has included stints at General Motors and Chip Ganassi Racing, as its new team president.\nDrivers on the move\n\nUnbeknownst to most at last Sunday's Washington Commanders game, many in NASCAR became aware of a part of Joe Gibbs Racing's 2024 plans in the Xfinity Series and the apparent hiring of a Cup veteran. While serving as a guest of the team, Joe Gibbs was seen introducing Aric Almirola to Commanders owner Josh Harris, with lip readers online ascertaining that Gibbs appeared to tell Harris that Almirola is now driving for them.\nAccording to Bob Pockrass, the expectation is that Almirola will drive part-time for Joe Gibbs Racing -- where he began his NASCAR career in the 2000s -- in the Xfinity Series, joining a driver lineup that will also include Chandler Smith and Sheldon Creed. Such would align with the expectations for Almirola's racing future, as he had entertained continuing to race part-time when it was announced he would not return to Stewart-Haas Racing in 2024.\nThe matter of Almirola's replacement in the SHR No. 10 has been a rather poorly-kept secret: It is widely expected the team will hire Noah Gragson as its new driver as Gragson looks to reclaim his standing as a bright young star following a disastrous rookie year in Cup with Legacy Motor Club. Gragson was recently spotted at Stewart-Haas Racing's shop, and he also drove a Ford in this past weekend's Snowball Derby with Rette Jones Racing.\nGragson did not let on to any 2024 plans in a recent conversation with Matt Weaver of Sportsnaut, instead choosing to discuss his regrets and personal growth from the end of his rookie season. Gragson resigned as the driver of the No. 42 in August while serving a month-long suspension after he was spotted having liked a racially insensitive meme on his Instagram account.\n\"There have been some challenges this year, but I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world,\" Gragson said. \"I don't know that I would change anything that has happened because I have learned from it and it gives me a chance to be a better person.\n\"In life, you either win or you learn, on and off the racetrack. The wins have been great, but you learn through the hardships and defeats. I am grateful to have good people around me, and I'm working really hard every day to hopefully get a second chance and to make the most of it.\"\nWhile the Stewart-Haas No. 10 seat is seemingly filled, some intrigue still exists as to exactly who will drive the No. 16 for Kaulig Racing next season. After running the car full-time in 2023, it was announced Thursday that A.J. Allmendinger would go back to full-time Xfinity Series racing for Kaulig in 2024, though he will continue to run a partial Cup schedule.\nThe assumption of many had been that the No. 16 would be taken over by Ty Dillon, but that assumption may have been premature. Weaver shared in a recent thread on X that information suggesting Dillon had been hired to drive the No. 16 was \"incorrect,\" casting ambiguity on both who will join Daniel Hemric at Kaulig next season as well as the exact plans of Dillon, who has bounced from team to team since Germain Racing shut down following the 2020 season.\nNuts and Bolts\n\nThis article, authored by Steven Taranto, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-12-07 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":487}
{"title":"Spill toasts one year with a 2.7M seed extension, Kerry Washington and champagne","context":"## Spill toasts one year with a 2.7M seed extension, Kerry Washington and champagne\n\nAt midnight last Friday, Alphonzo Terrell held up a glass of Dom P\u00e9rignon and toasted his one-year anniversary of being laid off at Twitter.\nIf it weren\u2019t for that moment, he wouldn\u2019t be in Austin at an AfroTech after-party, surrounded by thousands of people who now know his name and his social media app, Spill. As a competitor to the platform now known as X, Spill hails itself as a safer place for Black Americans and the LGBTQ community and has amassed around 200,000 users, he said. This past year, the app, which is still in beta mode, has raised a total of $5 million in pre-seed funding, including a recent $2 million extension round led by Collide Capital.\n\u201cWe put an invite-only beta in June, and within three weeks, it went viral,\u201d Terrell told TechCrunch. \u201cSuddenly, we\u2019re supporting a city, we have data costs, we have infrastructure, we have to accelerate our building times, so we really needed an extension to do that effectively.\u201d\nHis journey with Spill started last year at AfroTech. He arrived at the conference just days after being laid off from what was then Twitter, along with about 3,000 others amid Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition. Terrell hopped on a call with former Twitter colleague DeVaris Brown about a business idea and spent three days in an Airbnb creating the pitch deck for what became Spill. At AfroTech, he went around taking last-minute coffee meetings, seeing who would give his company a chance. Flash-forward to this year and Spill is the cool kid in town.\nSo many apps have sprung up over the last year in an attempt to become \u201cthe new Twitter,\u201d but no app has emerged as the dominant refuge for disillusioned Twitter users. Threads, Instagram\u2019s supposed \u201cTwitter killer,\u201d got 100 million sign-ups within five days; the decentralized platform Mastodon has 1.8 million monthly active users; and the smaller upstart Bluesky hit 1 million users in September. Though still in beta, Spill\u2019s community of 200,000 users may seem small in comparison, but Spill\u2019s rise has shown that quality matters just as much as quantity \u2014 that building a strong core community is just as valuable as high-speed growth, even if the traditional venture model may not always incentivize thoughtful product development.\n\u201cIf you have a great experience, you\u2019re going to grow,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cEspecially in a world where you have so many networks \u2014 there are all these choices that people conceivably have \u2014 you\u2019re gonna go to the one where you have the greatest experience and want to invest your time.\u201d\nAnother app that spun out from laid-off former Twitter employees, Pebble (formerly T2), recently shut down after a year, growing to just 20,000 registered users. Its CEO, Gabor Cselle, previously had exits to Google and Twitter, but accepted that Pebble simply wasn\u2019t competitive enough to stay afloat. But while Pebble sought to essentially clone Twitter, Spill\u2019s team is building something that looks very little like it.\n\u201cPeople are looking for something new,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cI think things that have really defined, unique value propositions are going to win over the long term \u2014 it might not be like there\u2019s one winner-take-all.\u201d\nEarlier this year, TechCrunch covered the founding of Spill, piquing the interest of Kapor Capital, which ended up writing the company its first check.\n\u201cWe had over 25,000 people join our waiting list in less than 24 hours from that article,\u201d Terrell said.\nThis weekend, as CEO, Terrell took the AfroTech stage twice: once to interview Mitch and Freida Kapor, the founders of Kapor Capital, and a second to reveal a new app feature: Tea Party, which is similar to Instagram Live. The first user to host a Tea Party was actress Kerry Washington. Terrell\u2019s next dream Tea Party host? Keke Palmer, who is already on Spill. So are other cultural icons like Questlove, Ava DuVernay and Janelle Mon\u00e1e.\n\u201cTea Parties reflect the communities that we have always spoken very clearly that we are here to center,\u201d Kenya Parham, Spill\u2019s Global VP of Community and Partnerships, told TechCrunch. \u201cBlack communities, queer communities, women, non-binary and femme stories are all the way at the forefront, and the community is just eating it up.\u201d\nAnne Griffin can attest to that. She\u2019s a product manager based in New York and signed up for Bluesky, Spill and Threads last year. Out of those three, Spill is the only one she is still consistently using. \u201cIt feels much more rooted in authentic connection,\u201d she told us about the app, praising its product features. \u201cIn a world where many social media algorithms focus on engagement at any cost, it\u2019s refreshing to have an app that is focused on engagement around community in culture.\u201d\nWashington, meanwhile, joined the platform organically; Spill has \u201cnot paid for a single acquisition to date,\u201d Parham said, which speaks to the influence and respect that the app\u2019s leadership has established in the entertainment and tech industries. Before Spill, Terrell led marketing teams at HBO and Showtime; Parham ran her own strategic communications consultancy, working with a laundry list of major production studios. So, already, Spill has wooed advertising partners like Netflix, Lionsgate, VH1, Showtime and Sony Pictures.\nSpill has come to be a bright spot in the post-Twitter era. Users are organizing in-person meetups in Atlanta, New York and \u201cSpillicon Valley.\u201d At AfroTech, Spill gave out customized tea bags created with the help of Nigerian-American tea sommeliers while lines formed to use a Spill-branded 360 camera at a house party, inspired by an actual trend on the app where people share photos of themselves on Fridays.\nThe app is set to exit beta and open to the public next year. As Terrell previously discussed with TechCrunch, the app has plans to pay creators for their cultural contributions to the app, which is especially important for Black creators in the creator economy.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get credit for all the contributions that we make,\u201d Terrell said of Black artists in the space.\nDespite the robust year, however, the story for Spill is just beginning, with AfroTech reminding Terrell of how far they\u2019ve come, but also how far they have to go.\n\u201cTo be able to make something for the community, it\u2019s just really beautiful,\u201d he said.\nUpdate, November 7, 2:20 PM: Spill\u2019s seed extension is $2 million, not $2.75 million.\n\nThis article, authored by Amanda Silberling, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-07 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":488}

If any team achieved that goal, it was Chicago.\nIt wasn't an aesthetically pleasing game, but that was never the expectation. The Bears grinded out a 16-13 victory behind a terrific defensive performance, a solid running game, and a few timely throws by Tyson Bagent.\nThe Panthers jumped out to an early lead on a punt returned for a touchdown by Ihmir Smith-Marsette, but they never found the end zone again. The only offensive touchdown of the night came in the third quarter, when D'Onta Foreman rumbled his way into the end zone to give Chicago a 16-10 lead.\nNFL WEEK 10 PICKS: Straight up | Against the spread\nAs it turned out, 16 points was all the Bears needed. After Eddy Pineiro cut Carolina's deficit to three early in the fourth quarter, Frank Reich put his trust in Pineiro again with the game on the line, sending him out for a 59-yard attempt on fourth-and-10 in the final minutes rather than trusting the offense to pick up the 10 yards. Pineiro's kick was short.\nWhile the decision to kick from 59 yards out might be second-guessed, Carolina's offense didn't give Reich much reason to believe. Bryce Young struggled to develop any kind of rhythm through the first three quarters, and even the Panthers' most successful drives were laborious, consistently requiring conversions on third and fourth down.\nWhile Young got little help from his receivers, who failed to get open all night, his struggles \u2014 including multiple passes that were nearly intercepted \u2014 are a reminder that the Panthers' offense is still a long way from resembling anything like the unit owner David Tepper envisioned when the franchise traded for the No. 1 pick in March.\nMORE: Why Frank Reich's job might already be at risk\nThe Bears (3-7) are hoping to get Justin Fields back in time for their Week 11 game in Detroit, but they've gotten a shot in the arm from Bagent, who improved to 2-2 as a starter with the win.

{"title":"Rollback Policy, a Boon or a Curse? The Controversial System That Might Redefine the Golfing World by the End of 2030","context":"## Rollback Policy, a Boon or a Curse? The Controversial System That Might Redefine the Golfing World by the End of 2030\n\nThe distance golf balls travel has increased multifold. So a change is necessary to address the issue. Otherwise, the golf courses need to be perpetually extended. Not us. This is the opinion of both Royal & Ancient (R&A) and United States Golf Association (USGA) officials who decided it\u2019s time to bring in the golf ball rollback policy. According to them, with new technologies, golf balls are covering far more distance, resulting in lengthening the courses and incurring a greater financial burden on the golf clubs. Moreover, there are a growing number of voices who feel golf has become way less competitive nowadays.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nOn the other hand, there is a chance this might create bifurcation, which no one likes. The rules are non-binding in nature. So, tours and regional governing bodies can decide for themselves whether to implement them or not. Regardless, suppose R&A and USGA, which organize 35 championships between themselves, put this into action, and PGA and other Tours reject them. In that case, amateurs might be playing with \u2018corrected\u2019 balls, while the Tour pros will be playing with the same balls. Steeped in rich irony, indeed. Although the proposed rules are not set to be implemented before at least 2026, let\u2019s explore the existing complications.\nWhat happens to the majors with the rollback policy?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIf they pass the rules, the R&A that organizes The Open and the USGA, the organizer of the U.S. Open, will have the limited-flight balls in these two majors. What about the others? That\u2019s for the Augusta National and PGA of America to decide.\nNotably, Seth Waugh, the PGA of America CEO, in a memo to R&A, denounced the proposals, taking along nine other PGAs across the globe. While Fred Ridley, the chairman of Augusta National, didn\u2019t exactly bang the drum for MLR, the former amateur golfer did stand behind the governing bodies, saying he would much prefer to see the issue finally addressed. Notably, Augusta infamously \u2018Tiger-proofed\u2019 their course to make it \u2018tougher\u2019 for golfers (read Tiger Woods).\nOne thing should be noted here. Although R&A and USGA both organize two LPGA majors, the Women\u2019s Open and the U.S. Women\u2019s Open, respectively, the rules will apply only to two men\u2019s golf. Why? Because the average driving distance on the LPGA Tour is still well within the accepted norm of the two regulatory bodies. We haven\u2019t heard any noise from the female circuit, even though Lexi Thompson shot a 316-yard drive at the Shrines Children\u2019s Open. But the PGA Tour Pros and LIV Golf Pros chimed in with their thoughts.\nWhat do players think of this?\nMost players are less than happy with the change. And that reaction cut across the LIV Golf-PGA Tour divide. Justin Thomas, a fifteen-time winner on the Tour who is also a part of the PGA Tour policy board, termed it \u201cselfish\u201d on the USGA\u2019s part. \u201cI think the USGA over the years has, in my eyes, it\u2019s harsh but made some pretty selfish decisions,\u201d he stated. \u201cThey definitely, in my mind, have done a lot of things that aren\u2019t for the betterment of the game, although they claim it.\u201d\nThe 2022 PGA Championship winner drew an interesting comparison. In the NBA, players now jump much higher than they did in the 1990s. But the hoop height has stayed the same at 10 feet above the playing surface. The two-time Major winner credits the player\u2019s grind for this.\nWhat Is the Model Local Rule? As the Golf Ball Rollback Debate Takes Off Once Again, All You Need To Know About the USGA?s and R&A?s Brainchild\nEchoing similar sentiments, Bryson DeChambeau, who joined LIV Golf in 2022, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a great handicap for us guys that have worked really hard to learn how to hit it farther.\u201d The 2020 U.S. Open Champion regularly crushes drives to 310\u2013320 yards. No wonder he termed the policy \u201catrocious.\u201d\nInterestingly, Rory McIlroy, whose average of 326.7 yards puts him on top of the PGA Tour\u2019s driving distance leaderboard, backed this proposal for elite-level golfers. Speaking to the No Laying Up Podcast, the five-time Major winner said, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to help the overall professional game. I think making guys hit some long irons again and some mid irons and being able to hit every club in your bag in a round of golf.\u201d\nWhat does the Big Cat have to say about this? After all, it was Tiger Woods, whose astounding power behind the shots in the late 90s and early 2000s started the debate. Surprisingly, the fifteen-time major winner feels a course correction is necessary here. \u201cI think this should have happened a long time ago.\u201d\nIn fact, he said something that might not sit well with most, \u201cI\u2019ve been of the position if you play in a pro event or you have a P next to your name, you should be playing a pro ball. If you have an A next to your name and you\u2019re playing an amateur event, you should use an amateur ball.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nHow will the golf ball rollback policy affect LIV golfers?\nThe R&A and USGA have not made it binding on any governing bodies to implement the rules. For the breakaway league, this is the easiest path. One reason is that power hitters such as Bryson DeChambeau will be affected in more ways than one otherwise.\nSecondly, a league that thrives on thrills and excitement will lose its USP if the ball suddenly doesn\u2019t travel 300 yards on most occasions. As of this year, 28 of 48 LIV golfers average over 300 yards driving distance. Dustin Johnson and DeChambeau are both in the top five.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nBut one crucial thing to remember here is that the golf ball rollback policy will render most balls totally \u2018unplayable\u2019. Moreover, the PGA Tour has contradicted itself several times in the past few years. It won\u2019t be surprising if Monahan & Co. eventually decides to agree with the policy change sometime later. So, the question remains: how viable would it be for manufacturers to produce two types of balls, one for Majors and the other for LIV Golf? This just throws the world of golf into uncharted territory.\nWatch This Story: Is Tiger Woods Making Use Of Any Medical Aid After His Subtalar Fusion?\n\nThis article, authored by Parnab Bhattacharya, was published by Essentially Sports on 2023-12-03 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":490}
{"title":"The Apple Watch\u2019s double tap gesture points at a new way to use wearables","context":"## The Apple Watch\u2019s double tap gesture points at a new way to use wearables\n\nThe coolest Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 feature wasn\u2019t actually available when the watches launched last month. Double tap, which finally arrives today via the watchOS 10.1 update, lets you interact with the watch without ever needing to use the touchscreen. With a quick pinching motion, you can use it to scroll through the new smart stack of widgets in watchOS 10, pause or end timers, skip music tracks, and answer phone calls. It\u2019s the sort of feature that you might read about and scoff at \u2014 until you\u2019re unloading groceries from your car, hands full, and an important call comes through on your watch.\nDepending on who you are, this kind of scenario might happen multiple times a day or once in a blue moon. In the past few weeks with the watchOS 10.1 beta, some days I completely forgot double tap existed. Either my hands were free, or muscle memory kicked in and I\u2019d use the watch as I always have. Other days, when my to-do list felt as long as a CVS receipt, I morphed into a double tap fiend, so much so that I sometimes felt like a flamenco dancer snapping away with their castanets.\nDouble tap activates the primary action of an app. GIF by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nI got a rundown of how double tap works when I reviewed the Series 9 and Ultra 2, but it hits differently once you start using it in your day-to-day life. Controlling gadgets with gestures is often gimmicky \u2014 tech that seeks to show off rather than solve a problem. But double tap does solve a genuine problem and is born from accessible design that serves real needs. That, in turn, made me more curious about what went into creating the gesture, the tech behind it, its limitations, and what it implies for the future of smartwatches.\nThe chip behind double tap\nDouble tap technically isn\u2019t a new gesture so much. In 2021, Apple introduced Assistive Touch, an accessibility feature designed for people with limb differences or mobility issues. The idea was to give these folks a way to navigate through menus and control the Apple Watch without needing a second hand.\nOn the surface, it can seem like double tap is a rebadged version of Assistive Touch. That\u2019s led to understandable confusion as to how the two features differ \u2014 and why double tap isn\u2019t available on older Apple Watches that support Assistive Touch (Series 4 or later, including the first-gen SE and Ultra).\nThe short answer is that the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 have a more powerful chip. Specifically, the new S9 features four neural engines for machine learning, which is what powers double tap. On older watches, Assistive Touch was run on the main CPU. But is that distinction really enough to make a difference?\nThe double tap algorithm has to be able to sort through a lot of noisy data to detect when you are \u2014 and aren\u2019t \u2014 making the gesture. GIF by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nYes, according to David Clark, senior director of Apple Watch software engineering. \u201cBecause we\u2019re on a purpose-built part of the processor, we\u2019re not contending with all the other things the CPU is doing at any given time,\u201d says Clark. The result is the Series 9 and Ultra 2 are 15 percent more accurate at detecting the double tap gesture, and the feature itself is much less power intensive.\nI wouldn\u2019t blame anyone for feeling skeptical. But there is an absurd amount of data that needs to be processed for double tap to work. At the most basic level, the algorithm that detects the double tap gesture is trained on data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart rate sensor collected from the wrist.\nApple says that while the double tap gesture evolved out of Assistive Touch, it requires the computing power of the S9 SiP. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nIf you know anything about wearable sensors, that\u2019s not as simple as it sounds. Wrist data is incredibly tricky to work with because there\u2019s a lot of noise in the signal. On top of calculating how light reflects off of blood pumping through your veins, smartwatch algorithms have to account for your arm (plus muscles, veins, and tendons) physically moving around during different activities like walking, running, and gesticulating. Another challenge is no two people have the exact same body. Differences in wrist size and limb length have to be taken into consideration.\nIronically, the years that Apple put into improving heart rate helped cut through that noise. According to Clark, \u201cthe gaps in reliable signals for heart rate\u201d were what his team used to confirm subtler motions like the double tap gesture.\n\u201cReliability also means that when you\u2019re doing things that are almost like a tap, or a double tap, that we\u2019re not erroneously triggering the gesture.\u201d\n\u201cReliability means that when you do the gesture, we\u2019re able to detect it,\u201d Clark says. \u201cReliability also means that when you\u2019re doing things that are almost like a tap, or a double tap, that we\u2019re not erroneously triggering the gesture. We got to make sure we\u2019re able to detect the right thing through by tuning these things with the right scenarios.\u201d\nMeaning, the algorithm also has to be able to differentiate when someone is in motion, the type of activities they\u2019re doing, and what other features they may be using on the watch at a given point in time. Streaming music or taking calls might seem unrelated to double tap, but the algorithm must be able to account for the noise introduced by subsystems like LTE and Bluetooth. That\u2019s harder to do well when everything is done on the main CPU.\nDouble-click for the wrist\nThat\u2019s the technical side of the equation. But practically speaking, it\u2019s easier to see how Assistive Touch and double tap differ once you try using both.\n\u201cAssistive Touch is a comprehensive navigational system,\u201d says Eric Charles, senior manager of Apple Watch Product Marketing. For instance, if you use Assistive Touch, you\u2019ll notice a blue outline that visually cues the parts of a screen you can interact with when you can interact with them. You can enable a motion-based cursor as well. Another difference Charles points out is that with Assistive Touch, you have four gestures: single tap, double tap, clench, and double clench. According to Charles, it became evident early on that not everyone has the full strength to clench their hand, while others may not be able to do two quick, subsequent motions \u2014 such as a double tap.\nClenching is a gesture you can use with Assistive Touch, but it\u2019s there to provide a wider range of options for people who may not be able to make a pinching motion. GIF by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think of it necessarily as \u2018Hey, there are four available gestures here.\u2019 It\u2019s that audience needs the ability to customize those gestures in a way that you don\u2019t because your ability goes further than what they might be able to do.\u201d\nDouble tap isn\u2019t designed to help you navigate anything. The best way I can describe it is Assistive Touch is like the mouse to your computer. It scrolls, it selects, and it\u2019s highly programmable. Double tap is more like the double-click portion of using a mouse. You use it solely to perform the main action of an app. And to do that, Apple had to spend a lot of time researching what people wanted or expected a single double tap to do.\n\u201cWe collected data over hundreds of users, thousands of instances of these gestures internally to create models that represent all the different use cases we think [double tap] will be used in,\u201d explains Clark, noting that Apple cataloged all the potential user experiences that could potentially use double tap. It then solicited feedback from testers about how intuitive the feature was to use and whether it behaved in the way they expected. \u201cThere was an exhaustive list of screenshots, what those screens were, how a user could get to them, and then a detailed discussion through each and every one of those areas.\u201d\nThe answers from that internal research were then iterated multiple times, taking into consideration different types of testers. Some were complete novices, while others were more familiar with the gesture, and others yet were experts in human interaction engineering. That extensive feedback process is also why double tap is no longer called double pinch in Assistive Touch.\n\u201cWe did a lot of testing internally, and one of the things we learned is that when you tell someone to pinch, they hold the lower part of the gesture more than they release. Tap evokes a release,\u201d says Charles, who explained that the simple name change led to testers performing the gesture more accurately.\n(To be clear, we at The Verge will still be unofficially calling it the pinchy pinch.)\nThe limits of simplicity\nIn talking with Clark and Charles, it\u2019s clear Apple went through such a tedious process because this is supposed to be one of those magical features that \u201cjust works.\u201d\nAnd, when double tap performs as intended, it does feel a bit like the watch can read my mind. It\u2019s genuinely cool to see double tap work with not just my index finger but the rest of them as well. To my surprise, it feels less gimmicky than I expected. But despite Apple\u2019s efforts, it doesn\u2019t take long to run into double tap\u2019s limitations.\nDouble tap makes using the Smart Stack more intuitive, but I wish it could scroll AND select. GIF by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nMedia controls are a good example. Should a double tap either pause or play your music? Or should it let you skip to the next track? If you\u2019re someone who uses your smartwatch to control playback on smart speakers, the former makes more sense. If you\u2019re a runner and the wrong song pops up on your playlist, the latter is more useful. I\u2019ve run into this in various scenarios, but this happens to be one of only two instances where you can choose what double tap does. (For me, I\u2019ve set double tap to skip to the next track.)\nThat lack of choice is also apparent in third-party apps. My email app lets me double-tap to start a quick reply using Siri, but even in 2023, I am not dictating my emails. Apps like Spotify and Pocket Casts don\u2019t work with double tap, either. Most third-party apps that do work with double tap just let you dismiss notifications. That\u2019s helpful but still limiting.\nWith watchOS 10, apps like Fitness and Weather have been redesigned to be more glanceable. Instead of one long screen that you scroll endlessly through, information is divided into more digestible chunks. You still scroll, but there\u2019s less of it. This is great, except I often want to use double tap to navigate through menus instead of the digital crown. And I can\u2019t.\nYou can scroll through the new widget Smart Stack, but if I want to select a widget and open it, I still have to use my other hand. If I want to select a widget, I can customize it to do that, but it only ever selects the top widget. You have to just trust that Apple\u2019s algorithms will surface the right widget.\nCustomizability is currently limited to music playback and the smart stack. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge The double tap glyph lets you know when you can and can\u2019t use the gesture to control an action. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nMultitasking is another area where double tap can fall short. If I want to pause a timer but have navigated away from that app, I have to either use my other hand or use Siri. Otherwise, I can wait for the timer to go off and use double tap to end the timer.\nMore customization would be the obvious answer, but it\u2019s one that Apple was wary of for this first iteration of double tap.\n\u201cWhile customization can be a really powerful tool, oftentimes customization is where a lot more complexity can come into the process,\u201d says Clark. I get what Clark means. Not everyone, after all, has the patience to set up dozens of Focus modes or tinker with Shortcuts. If you want to keep things simple, you inevitably have to narrow the focus.\nA future of smartwatch gestures\nDespite the limitations, the combination of glanceable apps, widgets, Siri, and double tap has started to change how I use my Apple Watch. I never used to use the more analog, aesthetically pleasing watchfaces because it meant sacrificing my complications. With double tap, I can use those watchfaces now because all I have to do is flick my wrist and double tap to view my widgets. If I want to launch the app, I can just ask Siri to open it.\nYou can already use multiple fingers for the double tap gesture. It\u2019s not hard to imagine other iterations down the line. GIF by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nIt doesn\u2019t always work that seamlessly. There are times when the primary action isn\u2019t what I want to do, or eventually, I get to the point where I have to use my other hand. (In the above example, once I ask Siri to open the app, I may have to scroll with the digital crown to reach the information I need.) But it\u2019s not hard to imagine future iterations of double tap can both scroll and select. Something that\u2019s not quite as comprehensive as Assistive Touch but strikes a finer balance between simplicity and customizability \u2014 without relying too much on Apple trying to figure out what it is you want to do.\nEven now, with double tap\u2019s existing limitations, I can do more while on the go and without my phone. I find myself reaching for it much less \u2014 or when I do, it\u2019s for much more intentional purposes like reading, shopping, or watching a video. The past few weeks with double tap have felt like a glimpse into a smartwatch future that\u2019s independent of phones \u2014 devices that, instead of triaging notifications and calls, handle them entirely.\n\nThis article, authored by Victoria Song, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-25 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":491}

The Melbourne Rebels are expected to follow.\nRA chief executive Phil Waugh says building trust back between the governing body and states is essential to their plans.\nUnder fire Wallabies coach Eddie Jones also advocated for Australian rugby to move to a centralised model, believing the nation had fallen behind the rest of the world.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a state-based union that\u2019s run by the states, the national union wants to assume more responsibility and when things were going well, no one questioned that,\u201d Jones said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBut over the last period of time, they haven\u2019t been going so well and this tournament\u2019s probably been the icing on the cake where it\u2019s got to a stage where I think people, most people probably think there\u2019s time for change. But it\u2019s not going to go easy.\n\u201c[It\u2019s] one of the key issues. We need to maximize the development of the players. At the end of the day, that\u2019s the key to success and alignment of your resources, for a small country.\n\u201cBecause Australia, if you look at the history of rugby, when we were amateur, we were probably ahead of the game because we had the influence of rugby league. We had the influence of AFL and our players were more professional than the rest of the world.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI know what\u2019s going on and we need to get a better system of developing players. We need to develop better players and we need to develop a larger batch of better players and that only comes through changing the whole system.\u201d\nWhile all five Australian Super Rugby sides fundamentally are on board with regards to moving to a centralised high-performance program, The Roar added that some states, including the ACT Brumbies as well as the QRU, don\u2019t want to give up their commercial assets.\nThe QRU confirmed that on Wednesday morning.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe QRU is committed to working with Rugby Australia to lead reform of our game at a high-performance level, and help Rugby Australia develop an improved game through high-performance centralisation,\u201d the statement read.\n\u201cCentralisation\u201d would include a national player-contracting model, and alignment of key high-performance staff, such as coaching, strength and conditioning, and medical to operate as one national system.\u201d\nThe letter pointed to RA\u2019s involvement in Les Kiss\u2019 appointment as Reds coach, with the former State of Origin winger turned coach, who has spent the best part of two decades coaching in Ireland and England, replacing Brad Thorn.\nAs The Roar has previously reported, the QRU stopped short of wanting to hand over its commercial property.\n\u201cWhile the QRU is very supportive of high-performance alignment, it will not agree to any proposal on centralising commercial or corporate functions,\u201d the letter read.\n\u201cThe very strength of our State unions is the expertise they bring in their own markets.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe are open to work on commercial initiatives together but will always retain our independence for the benefit of Queensland Rugby, its members and stakeholders.\n\u201cQueensland Rugby has built a sustainable business model through the elimination of legacy operating debt, delivered four-straight operating profits and worked in partnership with Governments to successfully deliver $31 million of improvements to Ballymore through the construction of the National Rugby Training Centre, the home of the Wallaroos and Queensland Reds.\u201d\nThe letter also pointed to the 71,000 players across the state, including more than 16,000 of those female participants, 257 schools featuring rugby as part of its program, as well as its Hospital Cup competition and regional club competitions, as evidence that the game was in good health in Queensland.\nThe QRU also expressed its satisfaction that RA was willing to discuss the annual $1.7m being reinstated, which had been withheld because of the Covid pandemic to keep the game afloat.\nMeanwhile, The Roar understands the ACT Brumbies have sent RA confirmation of solvency for the next 12 months.\nRA was forced to take out a $40m loan from Ares to keep the game afloat.\nAdvertisement\nWhile RA has around another $15m left to spend from the loan, the governing body is looking to borrow up to another $60m so they\u2019re in the strongest possible position to capitalise on the two major money-making events \u2013 the 2025 British and Irish Lions series and home men\u2019s World Cup in 2017 \u2013 and succeed.\nRA is also in the early stages of looking to renew its next broadcast deal, with the governing body hoping to at least double its current deal with Nine Entertainment\/Stan Sport, which is seeing them paid $29m per year until the end of 2025.\n\nThis article, authored by Christy Doran, was published by The Roar | Sports Writers Blog on 2023-10-10 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":492}

Horne briefly worked at Saracens as a general manger.\nRA always said they wanted to have the role filled by Christmas, with chief-executive Phil Waugh saying the successful candidate had one of the biggest jobs to change the game\u2019s standing in Australia.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big job,\u201d Waugh said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest job on my leadership team in terms of the impact it has on the general sentiment around the game.\u201d\nHorne will oversee all of Australia\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s high-performance programs.\nAdvertisement\nHe will also be tasked with \u201cintegrating\u201d the programs, with RA trying to centralise all of the Super Rugby\u2019s high-performance programs.\nPerhaps most pressing will be building a list of coaching candidates to take over from Eddie Jones, with RA wanting to have the new Wallabies coach set in stone by the start of Super Rugby.\nHorne\u2019s close relationship with former Ireland coach and All Blacks assistant Joe Schmidt could be one of the keys to landing the 2018 World Rugby coach of the year.\nAfter leaving his Irish post after six years following the 2019 World Cup, Schmidt worked alongside Horne at World Rugby.\nIt\u2019s believed the duo have a strong working relationship.\nWhile Schmidt\u2019s Irish side bombed out in successive quarter-finals under his leadership, the New Zealander took the Emerald Isle to the top of World Rugby\u2019s rankings.\nAlong the way, Schmidt played an instrumental role in not just seeing them become one of the world\u2019s best teams but helped usher through transformational change off the field, as Ireland moved to a centralised system.\nAdvertisement\nSchmidt briefly exited the international coaching scene following the 2019 World Cup, citing a desire to move home to New Zealand to be closer to his family.\nBut after initially moving back into the coaching fray with the Blues in Super Rugby, he joined the All Blacks ahead of last year\u2019s Rugby Championship as New Zealand Rugby shook the All Blacks coaching team up following their historic series loss to Andy Farrell\u2019s Irish.\nSchmidt\u2019s expertise proved telling, with he and Jason Ryan transforming the All Blacks and helping Ian Foster\u2019s side reach the final of this year\u2019s World Cup after stunning wins over Ireland and Argentina in the knockout stages.\nImportantly, the 58-year-old, The Roar understands, is interested in the Wallabies coaching job.\nDan McKellar, Stephen Larkham, Andy Friend and Ian Foster remain interested in the role.\nShould RA move on him, Schmidt\u2019s backing would be largely supported by the Super Rugby franchises, with several sources telling The Roar that the experienced coach is exactly the type of person the Wallabies need.\nAdvertisement\nAfter a year in where the Wallabies\u2019 detail and nous was clearly absent on the field, the highly detailed Schmidt would help bring rugby smarts to the Australian program.\nIndeed, the manipulation and ability to play both sides of the ruck was clearly visible by Ireland during his Irish tenure.\nWhat\u2019s more, should RA go down a path of bringing Schmidt into the fold, his own relationship with Ireland\u2019s long-time director of high-performance David Nucifora could see the Australian reconsider his position with the governing body.\nLast year Nucifora told The Roar he would unlikely consider returning to RA when he leaves his post with Ireland following next year\u2019s Olympics.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d be wise to revisit,\u201d Nucifora said.\n\u201cI think that you have a go at something once, you do your best and then if it\u2019s not good enough or it didn\u2019t work you move on, do something else.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhat\u2019s changed back there that I could think that, what I can offer, can change what they\u2019re doing still?\n\u201cI\u2019ll always love rugby.

{"title":"Fantasy Football RB Rankings Week 12: Who to start, best sleepers at running back","context":"## Fantasy Football RB Rankings Week 12: Who to start, best sleepers at running back\n\nAs we trot into Turkey Day week, only three more regular-season weeks remain until the fantasy football playoffs. Every decision \u2014 from the tough starts to the difficult sits; the savvy waiver adds to the costly drops \u2014 can ultimately decide whether your team is a contender or a pretender. Our Week 12 fantasy RB rankings for standard leagues will help guide you to the right moves and hopefully land you a big \"W\" for which to be thankful.\nTrade deadlines have passed in most leagues, so the majority of fantasy owners must soldier on toward the home stretch with the main core they have built to this point. On a positive note, we have no byes to worry about this \u2014 just plenty of short turnarounds, some potential weather concerns, and of course, the dreaded injury bug. Fortunately for us, we have been ahead of the curve with sleepers and breakouts all season, so we're more prepared to weather any storm than the average fantasy Joe.\nLet's get right to our Week 12 RB rankings so you can fully prepare for Thanksgiving week and put out a lineup with backs who will feast like the rest of us.\nMORE: Watch NFL RedZone live with Sling (50% off first month)\nWhich RBs are on bye in Week 12?\nNone! It's a Thanksgiving miracle! Not only do we not have any byes to worry about this week, but we also have NFL action on four different days (Thursday, Friday, Sunday, Monday).\nWEEK 12 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nIn some ways, however, a bye-free week at this stage of the season presents more challenges than ever. Whereas byes make some start 'em, sit 'em decisions no-brainers, 16-game weeks make it a lot easier to get lineup decisions wrong. Don't worry \u2014 we'll steer you in the right direction and keep you apprised of all the information you'll need throughout the week.\nWEEK 12 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWho are the best fantasy RBs in Week 12?\nAs always, Christian McCaffrey (@ Seahawks in Week 12) heads the list as the most matchup-proof running back in the NFL. Right behind him, Austin Ekeler (vs. Ravens) will look to bounce back after an uncharacteristically rough showing in Green Bay last week.\nAgainst the Commanders last week, Saquon Barkley (vs. Patriots) looked as good as we've seen him this season (140 total yards, two TDs). The Pats have surrendered 116 scrimmage yards per game and nine total TDs to RBs this season, so we like Barkley to pick up where he left off this Sunday (drive up that free-agency value, 'Quon!).\nYou don't see running mates cracking the top five very often, but we had to make the exception for David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs (vs. Packers). Entering Week 11, Green Bay had surrendered nearly 140 all-purpose yards per game to RBs. Between Detroit's o-line, the Lions' high-flying offensive attack, and the ruthless 1-2 punch DMont and Gibbs have been this season, the feast could be on very early for Dan Campbell's guys.\nTake a collective sigh of relief, Tony Pollard (vs. Commanders) owners! TP looked solid against Carolina last week, averaging 5.1 yards per carry and finally getting into the end zone for the first time since Week 1. We have the Cowboys back just outside our top five with a juicy matchup against a Washington D that just got lit up by Saquon and the G-men.\nRaheem Mostert (@ Jets) should continue to eat for Miami, with rookie De'Von Achane (knee) unfortunately getting hurt almost immediately after returning from IR (more on that later). Gang Green hasn't been nearly as good against the run as it has been against the pass, as Jets opponents have averaged 139 rushing yards per game over the past two weeks. 'Fins backup Salvon Ahmed also landed on the IR with a foot injury, so consider stashing Jeff Wilson Jr. as a handcuff.\nRounding out the top 10, the trio of Travis Etienne (@ Texans), Josh Jacobs (vs. Chiefs), and Breece Hall (vs. Dolphins) will be looking to bounce back from disappointing Week 11 outings on the ground. All three of these backs have been mostly solid, and none have much to worry about in terms of backfield competition.\nWEEK 12 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nWho are the best fantasy RB sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 12?\nSleep on Rhamondre Stevenson (@ Giants) at your own peril. 'Mondre has accumulated 231 yards from scrimmage and a TD over New England's past two games, and the Pats are coming off bye. Washington just carved the G-men up like a turkey on the ground last week, surrendering a whopping 174 yards and a TD. Gobble gobble.\nGet Kyren Williams (@ Cardinals) right back into your lineup the moment Los Angeles activates him from IR. Arizona just made Devin Singletary look like Barry Sanders, so Williams (ankle) should enjoy a triumphant return to the field. Keep rolling with Alexander Mattison (vs. Bears), too, against another below-average run defense.\nWelcome to the top 25, Zach Charbonnet (vs. 49ers)! With Kenneth Walker III's oblique injury comes opportunity for the rookie, who already looked strong in the month leading up to Seattle's narrow Week 11 loss to the Rams. Sure, Charbs' 69-yard effort in Los Angeles last week was a bit underwhelming, but we love his upside with a full game as the Seahawks' bell-cow.\nSpeaking of bell-cow backs, things are looking very promising for the short-term workload of Green Bay's AJ Dillon (@ Lions). Veteran Aaron Jones (knee) and rookie Emanuel Wilson (shoulder) both got hurt in Week 11, so Dillon should be the main man in Motown for the Pack. Power backs have enjoyed the most success against the Lions, as evidenced last week by Chicago's Roschon Johnson averaging 5.0 yards per carry and D'Onta Foreman finding paydirt.\nWEEK 12 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nWho are the biggest potential RB busts in Week 12?\nWe don't quite have the intestinal fortitude to bench Derrick Henry (vs. Panthers), but we must absolutely temper our expectations with the dude at this point. Over the past two weeks, he has tallied just 64 total yards on 23 touches (2.8 yards per touch). Carolina served as Tony Pollard's get-right game last week, so fire King Henry up if you have him. If he falters against the Panthers, you better have a backup plan moving forward (picking up Tyjae Spears as insurance is a good place to start).\nBoth Darrell Henderson and Royce Freeman (@ Cardinals) would be decent dart throws in a week filled with byes, but their floors in a zero-bye week seem too low to trust them if Kyren Williams is back and at 100 percent. The matchup is juicy, but we have no idea what to expect from a touch-share perspective, so these guys are no better than desperation, TD-dependent flexes.\nSpeaking of guys coming back from injury, we saw Khalil Herbert (@ Vikings) return to the field for Chicago against the Lions last week. However, his performance left a lot to be desired. He finished with just 35 yards on 16 carries and wound up vastly overshadowed by Justin Field's 100-yard rushing effort. Even worse, D'Onta Foreman scored the Chi's lone rushing TD on the afternoon.\nI don't care what your team looks like \u2014 you shouldn't be starting Chuba Hubbard or Miles Sanders (@ Titans). They weren't awful against Dallas last week on a per-touch basis, but neither finished with more than 12 touches. Even worse, no Carolina back has enjoyed a 60-yard rushing game since Oct. 15. Bad offensive line, negative game scripts, awful coaching \u2014 it's all bad, man!\nWhat are the biggest RB injuries in Week 12?\nSecond-year Seahawks back Kenneth Walker III suffered an oblique injury in Week 11 that the ever-hip Pete Carroll referred to as \"legit.\" KW3 has a better chance of missing multiple weeks than he does at suiting up for Seattle's Thanksgiving Day game against Fred Warner and the 49ers. If Zach Charbonnet somehow finds himself on your waiver wire, an early Merry Christmas to you if you have the FAAB or a high waiver priority.\nThe hits just keep on coming for the Packers' Aaron Jones, who suffered a knee injury but seems to have at least caught a break in the sense that he didn't tear his ACL. However, even a moderate MCL sprain could mean a multi-week absence for the injury-prone veteran back, especially in a lost season for the 4-6 Pack. Rookie Emanuel Wilson also hurt his shoulder in Week 11, so AJ Dillon could be getting the keys to Green Bay's backfield castle (although it's more of an oversized shack, at this point).\nDolphins rookie De'Von Achane, who looked like the runaway Offensive Rookie of the Year earlier this season, looked to have aggravated his MCL injury upon his Week 11 return against the Raiders. Achane has a chance to return for Miami's Week 12 tilt with the Jets on Friday, but we wouldn't be surprised if the 7-3 'Fins play it safe and keep him out until he's back to 100 percent. Meanwhile, Miami placed backup Salvon Ahmed on IR with a foot injury, so Jeff Wilson Jr. could be back in play as a handcuff stash.\nBears veteran D'Onta Foreman injured his ankle in Week 11. He could miss some time now that Khalil Herbert and Roschon Johnson are both back in action for Chicago.

{"title":"A provocative role for technologists in product innovation","context":"## A provocative role for technologists in product innovation\n\nProduct design is in a moment of profound change and redefinition as technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and spatial computing dramatically affect computing experiences. AI, especially, may have only minor impacts on interface design but will significantly impact the holistic product or ecosystem experience. Spatial computing, on the other hand, will change human-computer interactions and unmoor our understanding of what a computer is.\nIn this innovation cycle, product design requires a wider perspective of platforms and interconnections between technologies, creating a strong need for technologists and designers to be in the process together.\nFor successful products and businesses, innovation is perpetual. There is a never-ending search to find the next new thing that enhances the user experience, extends product reach, expands revenue, or all three simultaneously. Product design makes innovation less daunting and increases chances for success because it is a multidisciplinary process with structures and frameworks to catalyze innovation. Technologists have a role in the process that expands beyond simply validating the technology or concept, which is their customary responsibility. Before discussing the nontraditional ways technologists participate in product innovation, let\u2019s conceptually examine innovation and product design.\nThe word innovation has a simple meaning \u2014 to introduce something new or a novel method of doing something \u2014 yet we frequently inflate it to mean something magical, grandiose, and world-changing. Innovation can just as easily be mundane and straightforward. The key to innovation is being \u201cnew.\u201d The \u201cnew\u201d can be localized to a team, product, process, or business unit. The \u201cnovel\u201d can be well-known and established practices not incorporated into your workflow or product. Sometimes, innovation comes from closing small gaps and isn\u2019t always a grand eureka moment.\nInstead of forcing a technology onto a product, the design process flows to the technologies. In this way, the technology becomes a natural solution.\nProduct design is a process and not a discipline or deliverable. It is (understandably) easy to limit the scope of product design to color choices, content layout, and aesthetics. Too often, design is minimized to only the act of making user interfaces pretty. Product design is much deeper and broader in scope than visual design assets. For example, product design can give direction and focus to a business strategy, user experience strategy, or technology explorations.\nThe process establishes a guide rail throughout any innovation initiative. The core of product design is decision-making with an astute instinct for making the best decisions at the most opportune time. Product design helps reduce risk and leads to more effective innovation through quality decision-making.\nA progressive role for technologists\nTechnologists play a strategic role in product innovation and should bring a metaphysical perspective in addition to being punctilious. Our job is to communicate the essence of a technology and think strategically about the application of technologies to problem spaces. We are most constructive when we translate the technicals of \u201chow to make X do Y\u201d to \u201cthese are the types of products and services realizable with technology X.\u201d\nFor most technical leads and software developers, this is a mode inversion from our traditional tactical and direct interaction with technology. The context switch from daily build-and-operate is challenging but is paramount to developing successful and innovative products. We are uniquely positioned to generate strategic insights translated from dense technical minutiae that drive innovative business cases and product experiences.\nA technology innovation must solve a business problem, such as improving operational efficiency, growing existing revenue streams, or generating new ones. The problem space may be customer-facing (e.g., how can we deliver a new feature?) or internal-facing (e.g., how can we make a process more efficient?). The problem is the paramount concern. The specific technologies or innovations used to solve the problem are often less critical. We cannot lose perspective of the business needs; otherwise, the activities become too academic or a paid hobby.\nAn ordinary domestic analogy is hanging a picture. The hole size, bracket, or tools used to hang the picture are immaterial as long as the picture is on the wall and straight. The specifics of the process and technologies are only important as they pertain to how well they solve the problem, the costs to do so, and the overall end user experience.\nProduct innovation is experimental and should not always be expected to yield productive results. It requires a learning curve and patience, as the outcomes are often ambiguous and unknown. Business leadership can struggle with this perspective because it is indefinite (in terms of results and timelines), and it is challenging to translate pure technology innovation into value creation. A gap opens between technology and product teams wherein technology teams strain to articulate the capabilities and value of a technology innovation, leading to unfilled promises and the perception of \u201ctechnology for the sake of technology\u201d or quips like \u201ca solution looking for a problem.\u201d\nThe current hype cycle in AI serves as a great concrete example. For technology or product executives, the challenge is how to do more than check the AI box \u2014 it\u2019s about how to meaningfully incorporate AI into a product. Instead of forcing a technology onto a product, the design process flows to the technologies. In this way, the technology becomes a natural solution.\nAs experts on a technology or technology stack, we can communicate abstract insights or contribute in more conceptual contexts. Technologists add value to the product design process by sharing their expertise on a technology\u2019s characteristics. Designers use this information to shape and exploit technologies in the visual and interaction design process. In this way, technologists inform new interaction models, interface metaphors, and product channels. This involvement gives confidence and conviction to the promises of design.\nThink of digital technologies as a material like paint, stone, or wood. For artisans to create with materials, they must understand the material\u2019s ontology and phenomenology. An artist must know the differences between oil, acrylic, or watercolor paints because each material has different properties that affect how and what can be created. Technologists must \u201cfind the grain\u201d of a technology. In this way, they become an intermediary between the abstract nature of design and the pedantic nature of technology. This philosophical perspective is especially important when a product is in a growth stage or when using emerging technologies.\nRegardless of whether your product is growing or in a stable stage or employs established or emerging technologies, integrating technologists into the product strategy and design process enriches the final outcome. There is a technology perspective extending beyond the operations and mechanics of the code \u201cfactory floor,\u201d which provokes innovation.

NBA prop bets are an easy way to jump into basketball betting.\nProposition bets, or props, are easy to understand, numerous, and cover both player props and team props to give you plenty of variety.\nBelow, we look at betting NBA props at the best NBA betting sites and share some key information to make informed bets.\nWhat are NBA props?\nA prop bet is a side wager on an aspect of a game that usually doesn\u2019t tie directly to the result. In the NBA, prop bets deal with both players and teams.\nSome examples of NBA player props are:\nHow many points a player will score\nNumber of rebounds a player will have\nHow many assists a player will get\nRebounds and assists combined\nPoints, rebounds, and assists combined\nHow many steals a player will get\nNumber of three-pointers made\nSome examples of NBA team props include:\nWhich team will reach 10 points first\nWhich team will have the highest-scoring period\nWhich team will score first\nWhich team will win the first half\nWhich team will win the second half\nWill there be a fourth-quarter comeback victory\nAll of the best sports betting sites have their selection of prop bets for each NBA game, so shop around to find the sportsbooks that best suit your needs.\nHow to bet on NBA props\nThe first step to betting on NBA props is opening an account at an online sportsbook. The process is simple, free, and doesn\u2019t take very long. Below are the steps to opening a new account at an online sportsbook.\nChoose your sportsbook: Any state with legal online sports betting has a variety of sportsbooks. If you aren\u2019t sure which sportsbooks best fit your needs, research and read our reviews on each. And don\u2019t forget that you can have an account with more than one. Once you decide which sportsbook you\u2019re interested in, follow the link from our site to qualify for the best new customer welcome bonus.\nRegister for an account: At the top of the homepage of the sportsbook website, you will find a button that says \u201cregister\u201d or \u201csign up.\u201d Click that, and you\u2019ll be taken to a form you must fill out. It will ask for personal information such as your name, phone number, email address, last four digits of your Social Security number, and more.\nAccept the terms and conditions: Before finalizing your account information, you must accept the sportsbook\u2019s terms and conditions. We recommend you read through these to understand the rules your sportsbook will enforce regarding bets, especially for the sports you intend to wager on. The terms and conditions are also available on the sportsbook website for you to read at any point.\nGet your bonus: At this point, you can accept your welcome bonus. Be sure to read through the bonus requirements before accepting anything. If a bonus code is needed, which you can find on our website, this is where you will input it during the registration process.\nMake a deposit: Now that you\u2019ve signed up for an account, you can start funding your bankroll by making a deposit. Most legal sportsbooks have a variety of ways you can add funds to your account, such as through your bank or an e-wallet.\nStart betting: Go to the basketball section of your sportsbook and select the NBA. From there, you can choose individual games and make bets like money lines, point spreads, totals, props, futures, and more.\nHow to read NBA props odds\nAt first glance, all the positive and negative numbers at US sportsbooks can be daunting. The good news is they are easy to read once you understand what you see.\nNegative numbers, such as -110, represent how much money you need to wager to win $100. In many cases, such as a moneyline bet, the negative number also indicates which side of the bet is the favorite to win.\nFor example, if you were to bet on LeBron James scoring over 15.5 points in a contest at -125 odds, you\u2019d need to wager $125 to win $100. If you did and your bet was correct, then you\u2019d take home $225, which is your original $125 stake returned to you plus your $100 in profit.\nPositive numbers, like +145, show how much you stand to win for every $100 you wager. If you were to bet $50 on Giannis Antetokounmpo to have over 7.5 rebounds and the odds were +130 at the time you finalized your bet slip, you would win $65 in profit if your bet wins.\nPositive numbers also indicate which side of the bet is the underdog in the eyes of the oddsmakers.\nRemember that you can bet as little or as much as you want, and your payout will be calculated based on your wager amount and the odds at the time you make your bet.\nTypes of NBA props\nYou can make two main prop bets on the National Basketball Association:\nTeam props\nPlayer props\nTeam props are typically focused on statistical accomplishments by a particular team and rarely on the game\u2019s result. You\u2019ll often come across NBA team prop bets that are based on a team\u2019s points, such as the first team to reach 20 points, the first team to score in a game, or whether the total points by both teams in a contest will end up being odd or even.\nTeam props, also known as \u201cgame props,\u201d don\u2019t rely on individual players but rather on the team as a whole. Player props, on the other hand, are driven by individual performance.\nThese individual props are focused on statistical milestones during a game. The most popular bets typically focus on points, rebounds, assists, and three-point field goals. You can also bet on combination wagers, such as points and rebounds together.\nIn most cases, you can bet on traditional statistics for the five starters on each team.\nSee more:\nTips for betting on NBA props\nEvery bettor should develop their strategies, but we do have three tips you can use for NBA props.\nPay attention to player and team news: Oddsmakers use various information to develop their lines for games and players, and you should, too. Keep tabs on player news and injuries, when top players are being rested, how they performed in recent games, and more. You can find value in player and team props by gathering information from multiple sources and tracking how players and their teammates perform. For example, if one of the starting guards is questionable for a game, you might want to consider the other guard for increased points or assists since they\u2019ll likely handle a heavier load.\nKeep an eye on usage and minutes: Even slight increases to a player\u2019s average minutes can make a difference when betting player props, especially later in the season when aging veteran players tend to rest more. Keep yourself informed on usage and minutes trends for the players you\u2019re considering betting on, and use them to your advantage. Remember that some of the best players in the NBA were once on the bench for most games until small increases in their playing time gave them a chance to shine.\nShop for the best lines: This tip applies to every bet you make. Using multiple sportsbook accounts lets you find the best odds for every NBA prop bet. Even the smallest differences, like one sportsbook having odds at +125 and another at +135, can make a difference in your profit. By shopping for the best lines, you can make smarter bets and find the best value.\nRelated Pages:\n\nThis article, authored by Sam Eggleston, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-02 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":497}
{"title":"The UK just laid out new rules for the internet \u2014 it only gets harder from here","context":"## The UK just laid out new rules for the internet \u2014 it only gets harder from here\n\nAfter the Online Safety Act\u2019s arduous multiyear passage through the UK\u2019s lawmaking process, regulator Ofcom has published its first guidelines for how tech firms can comply with the mammoth legislation. Its proposal \u2014 part of a multiphase publication process \u2014 outlines how social media platforms, search engines, online and mobile games, and pornography sites should deal with illegal content like child sexual abuse material (CSAM), terrorism content, and fraud.\nToday\u2019s guidelines are being released as proposals so Ofcom can gather feedback before the UK Parliament approves them toward the end of next year. Even then, the specifics will be voluntary. Tech firms can guarantee they\u2019re obeying the law by following the guidelines to the letter, but they can take their own approach so long as they demonstrate compliance with the act\u2019s overarching rules (and, presumably, are prepared to fight their case with Ofcom).\n\u201cWhat this does for the first time is to put a duty of care on tech firms\u201d\n\u201cWhat this does for the first time is to put a duty of care on tech firms to have a responsibility for the safety of their users,\u201d Ofcom\u2019s online safety lead, Gill Whitehead, tells The Verge in an interview. \u201cWhen they become aware that there is illegal content on their platform, they have got to get it down, and they also need to conduct risk assessments to understand the specific risks that those services might carry.\u201d\nThe aim is to require that sites be proactive to stop the spread of illegal content and not just play whack-a-mole after the fact. It\u2019s meant to encourage a switch from a reactive to a more proactive approach, says lawyer Claire Wiseman, who specializes in tech, media, telecoms, and data.\nOfcom estimates that around 100,000 services may fall under the wide-ranging rules, though only the largest and highest-risk platforms will have to abide by the strictest requirements. Ofcom recommends these platforms implement policies like not allowing strangers to send direct messages to children, using hash matching to detect and remove CSAM, maintaining content and search moderation teams, and offering ways for users to report harmful content.\nLarge tech platforms already follow many of these practices, but Ofcom hopes to see them implemented more consistently. \u201cWe think they represent best practice of what\u2019s out there, but it\u2019s not necessarily applied across the board,\u201d Whitehead says. \u201cSome firms are applying it sporadically but not necessarily systematically, and so we think there is a great benefit for a more wholesale, widespread adoption.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also one big outlier: the platform known as X (formerly Twitter). The UK\u2019s efforts with the legislation long predate Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter, but it was passed as he fired large swaths of its trust and safety teams and presided over a loosening of moderation standards, which could put X at odds with regulators. Ofcom\u2019s guidelines, for example, specify that users should be able to easily block users \u2014 but Musk has publicly stated his intentions to remove X\u2019s block feature. He\u2019s clashed with the EU over similar rules and reportedly even considered pulling out of the European market to avoid them. Whitehead declined to comment when I asked whether X had been cooperative in talks with Ofcom but said the regulator had been \u201cbroadly encouraged\u201d by the response from tech firms generally.\n\u201cWe think they represent best practice of what\u2019s out there, but it\u2019s not necessarily applied across the board.\u201d\nOfcom\u2019s regulations also cover how sites should deal with other illegal harms like content that encourages or assists suicide or serious self-harm, harassment, revenge porn and other sexual exploitation, and the supply of drugs and firearms. Search services should provide \u201ccrisis prevention information\u201d when users enter suicide-related queries, for example, and when companies update their recommendation algorithms, they should conduct risk assessments to check that they\u2019re not going to amplify illegal content. If users suspect that a site isn\u2019t complying with the rules, Whitehead says there\u2019ll be a route to complain directly to Ofcom. If a firm is found to be in breach, Ofcom can levy fines of up to \u00a318 million (around $22 million) or 10 percent of worldwide turnover \u2014 whichever is higher. Offending sites can even be blocked in the UK.\nToday\u2019s consultation covers some of the Online Safety Act\u2019s least contentious territory, like reducing the spread of content that was already illegal in the UK. As Ofcom releases future updates, it will have to take on touchier subjects, like content that\u2019s legal but harmful for children, underage access to pornography, and protections for women and girls. Perhaps most controversially, it will need to interpret a section that critics have claimed could fundamentally undermine end-to-end encryption in messaging apps.\nThe section in question allows Ofcom to require online platforms to use so-called \u201caccredited technology\u201d to detect CSAM. But WhatsApp, other encrypted messaging services, and digital rights groups say this scanning would require breaking apps\u2019 encryption systems and invading user privacy. Whitehead says that Ofcom plans to consult on this next year, leaving its full impact on encrypted messaging uncertain.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not regulating the technology, we\u2019re regulating the context.\u201d\nThere\u2019s another technology not emphasized in today\u2019s consultation: artificial intelligence. But that doesn\u2019t mean AI-generated content won\u2019t fall under the rules. The Online Safety Act attempts to address online harms in a \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d way, Whitehead says, regardless of how they\u2019ve been created. So AI-generated CSAM would be in scope by virtue of it being CSAM, and a deepfake used to conduct fraud would be in scope by virtue of the fraud. \u201cWe\u2019re not regulating the technology, we\u2019re regulating the context,\u201d Whitehead says.\nWhile Ofcom says it\u2019s trying to take a collaborative, proportionate approach to the Online Safety Act, its rules could still prove onerous for sites that aren\u2019t tech juggernauts. BBC News notes that Ofcom\u2019s initial set of guidance is over 1,500 pages long. The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit behind Wikipedia, tells The Verge that it\u2019s proving increasingly challenging to comply with different regulatory regimes across the world, even if it supports the idea of regulation in general. \u201cWe are already struggling with our capacity to comply with the [EU\u2019s] Digital Services Act,\u201d the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s VP for global advocacy, Rebecca MacKinnon, says, pointing out that the nonprofit has just a handful of lawyers dedicated to the EU regulations compared to the legions that companies like Meta and Google can dedicate.\n\u201cWe agree as a platform that we have responsibilities,\u201d MacKinnon says, but \u201cwhen you\u2019re a nonprofit and every hour of work is zero sum, that\u2019s problematic.\u201d\nOfcom\u2019s Whitehead admits that the Online Safety Act and Digital Services Act are more \u201cregulatory cousins\u201d than \u201cidentical twins,\u201d which means complying with both takes extra work. She says Ofcom is trying to make operating across different countries easier, pointing toward the regulator\u2019s work setting up a global online safety regulator network.\nPassing the Online Safety Act during a turbulent era in British politics was already difficult. But as Ofcom begins filling in its details, the real challenges may be only beginning.\n\nThis article, authored by Jon Porter, was published by The Verge on 2023-11-09 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":498}

Developer Niantic has said once you have spent 70 Pumpkin Tickets on Jack-o\u2019-Head armor upgrades, further improvements will then only regular crafting materials. As such, this is a good number to aim for if you prefer to continue upgrading after the event ends.\nJack-o\u2019-Head armor skill explained\nOnce equipped, the Jack-o\u2019-Head armor has the skill Solidarity (Pumpkin Hunt). This is a party-based skill where having multiple players with the skill active increases attack power. During the Halloween event, this effect is increased by five.\nAs such, this is a rather situational skill, as not only do you need to be hunting with other players, but doing so during the Halloween event (which ends after Oct. 31) will see the most benefit.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible this skill will appear in future armor pieces to increase its potency (such as during next year\u2019s Halloween event), so crafting one now could be a sound investment for those looking to play with other hunters. Otherwise, for solo players, it might be simply a piece to add to your collection, especially if the ability to transmog (change the appearance of your armor) comes to the game one day.\nWhere to find pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku in Monster Hunter Now\nA Halloween-themed Kulu-Ya-Ku holding a pumpkin rock will \u201cappear in larger numbers than usual\u201d from Saturday, Oct. 28 at 9 a.m. local time until the end of Oct. 31.\nBy its very nature, Kulu-Ya-Ku appears in all three habitats (Forest, Desert, and Swamp) meaning they can appear anywhere on the map.\nBeyond the novelty of battling a Halloween-themed monster, taking down these special pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku will reward you with Pumpkin Tickets.\nNiantic has confirmed any pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku tagged with paintballs during the event will continue to drop Pumpkin Tickets after the event ends \u2014 giving you extra time if needed.\nLooking for more guides?
