Aaron Judge, Justin Verlander, Trea Turner and Xander Bogaerts all came away with new contracts.\nThis year's winter meetings could wind up being similarly busy. There is a growing sense Shohei Ohtani could sign during the winter meetings, and a move of that magnitude could kick off the next wave of moves. There's also a number of top players on the trade market, including star Padres outfielder Juan Soto.\nStarting Sunday, Dec. 3, and running through Wednesday, Dec. 6, expect MLB's offseason to really kick into high gear.\nWINTER MEETINGS: Shohei Ohtani rumors, Juan Soto trade destination come to forefront\nSporting News will be tracking all the latest news and rumors from the 2023 Winter Meetings. Follow for any signings and trades from Nashville.\nMLB Winter Meetings rumors, news, signings\nDiamondbacks reportedly land Eduardo Rodriguez\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\nThe reigning NL champions have landed one of the free agent market's top pitchers. Left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez has reportedly agreed to a four-year contract with Arizona worth around $20 million per year, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. The deal is still pending a physical, per Passan's report.\nA season ago, Rodriguez posted a career-low 3.30 ERA across 152.2 innings with the Tigers, and pitched to a 3.66 FIP. He decided to opt out of his deal with Detroit to test the free-agent market.\nJuan Soto reportedly traded to Yankees\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Joel Sherman, New York Post\nThe biggest star on the trade market has reportedly been traded. The Padres have reportedly sent Juan Soto to the Yankees in exchange for four pitchers and catcher Kyle Higashioka, according to the New York Post's Joel Sherman. Soto immediately adds to a potent left-handed bat to a lineup sorely in need of some thump from the left side, and provides some much-needed support to 2022 AL MVP Aaron Judge.\nMORE: Full Juan Soto trade details\nCraig Kimbrel signs with Orioles\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic and Joel Sherman, New York Post\nThe Orioles are bolstering their bullpen, signing Craig Kimbrel to a one-year, $13 million deal, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal. The NY Post's Joel Sherman reported he has a $1 million buyout for 2025 and a $13 million club option. The 35-year-old right-hander amassed 23 saves in 69 innings in 2023 with a 3.26 ERA. He is sitting on 417 career saves, ranking eighth all-time. He has a chance to vault all the way up to fourth, with Francisco Rodriguez (fourth) at 437 and Kenley Jansen (420 saves) the only other active reliever ahead of him.\nTrent Grisham likely headed to New York in Soto deal\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Joel Sherman, New York Post\nThe Yankees won't just be getting one outfielder from the Padres; it appears they'll be getting two. The NY Post's Joel Sherman reported Trent Grisham would also likely be on the move headed to New York. Grisham enjoyed a pair of breakout seasons to start his career in San Diego and has twice earned Gold Gloves (2020 and 2022), but his offensive production has dwindled, with him batting under .200 in back-to-back seasons.\nJuan Soto to Yankees 'close to being finalized'\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nA trade between the Yankees and Padres for Soto is reportedly \"close to being finalized,\" with right handers Michael King and Drew Thorpe expected to highlight the return to San Diego. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported the package will include at least two more players, neither of which will be Alex Verdugo.\nOhtani decision expected to be made before end of weekend\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nMLB free agency remains largely on hold as teams wait for Ohtani to sign, and though it had at at point been reported he could sign during the winter meetings, there appears to be a new timeline. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported Ohtani is expected to make his pick before the end of the upcoming weekend. The winter meetings end on Thursday.\nYoshinobu Yamamoto meeting with Yankees, already met with Mets\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network and Will Sammon, The Athletic\nThe Yankees could be on the verge of adding Soto, but they might not be done. The Yankees are reportedly going to meet with Yoshinobu Yamamoto in New York, the top pitcher on the market, on Monday. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported New York is considered to be one of the top teams to sign him, along with the Red Sox, Giants, Dodgers and Cubs.\nThat will be the second time Yamamoto has met with a New York team. He reportedly already met with Mets owner Steve Cohen in Japan last week.\n'Decent chance' Corbin Burnes is traded this winter\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\nCorbin Burnes has been named as one of the top trade candidates in the offseason, and it's looking increasingly plausible he might be dealt. NY Post's Jon Heyman reported one rival believes there's \"a decent chance\" Burnes is traded this winter. The 2021 NL Cy Young winner is a free agent after the 2024 season, and could be one of the most expensive pitchers to sign.\nMarlins 'listening' to offers on young pitchers\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\nMiami made a run to the postseason last year on the strength of its young pitching. And there's a chance the Marlins might now look to part with some of that depth to improve other areas of need. NY Post's Jon Heyman reported Miami is at least believed to be listening to trade packages for its young starters, including Jesus Luzardo, Braxton Garrett and Edward Cabrera, among others.\nAlex Verdugo 'expected' to stay with Yankees despite potential Juan Soto trade\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nThe Yankees acquired Alex Verdugo yesterday from the Red Sox. With the team's reported interest in Juan Soto, there was some speculation that Verdugo could be flipped to the Padres, however, MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported that New York is \"expected\" to keep the outfielder rather than include him in a deal with San Diego.\nJuan Soto trade to Yankees 'is likely'\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Jack Curry, YES and Brandon Tierney, WFAN\nNew York landed Alex Verdugo last night in a deal with the Red Sox. It appears the team could be close to landing the biggest trade acquisition of the offseason. YES' Jack Curry reported the Yankees have \"intensified efforts\" to trade for Soto and that a deal \"is likely.\" He expects New York to deal four or five players.\nAdditionally, WFAN's Brandon Tierney reported YES was told by the team to prepare for a 2 p.m. ET emergency \"Hot Stove Show\" and that there is a chance the Yankees complete the deal by lunch.\nOrioles 'close to deal' with reliever Craig Kimbrel\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 6\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic and Joel Sherman, New York Post\nThe Orioles are said to be \"close\" to a deal with free agent and former Phillies closer Kimbrel, Rosenthal reported Wednesday morning.\nBaltimore will be without All-Star closer Felix Bautista for the entire 2024 season after receiving Tommy John surgery in October. Even though stud reliever Yennier Cano emerged as the top candidate to take the job, Kimbrel could bolster the back end of the O's bullpen.\nVictor Caratini lands with Astros\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Chandler Rome, The Athletic and Mark Feinsand, MLB.com\nVeteran catcher Victor Caratini is headed to Houston on a two-year deal worth $12 million. The 30-year-old will serve as the backup to new starter Yainer Diaz now that Martin Maldonado has moved on.\nCaratini filled a similar role in Milwaukee the last two years, slashing .259\/.327\/.383 with seven home runs in 62 games in 2023.\nPirates acquire Marco Gonzales from Braves\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\nGonzales, who was acquired by the Braves in the trade that helped them land Jarred Kelenic on Sunday, is being re-routed to Pittsburgh for cash and a player to be named later.\nGonzales, 31, is a decent rotation arm with 65 wins, 665 strikeouts and a 4.14 ERA over 893.0 innings pitched in his nine-year career.\nYankees land Alex Verdugo from Red Sox\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\nFor just the seventh time in the last 50 years (!), the Red Sox and Yankees have agreed to a deal.\nBoston will send starting OF Alex Verdugo to New York for RHP Richard Fitts, RHP Greg Weissert and RHP Nicholas Judice.\nVerdugo had been the Red Sox's starting outfielder for the last four seasons, coming over as the centerpiece in the trade that sent Mookie Betts to the Dodgers. Verdugo hit .281 with 43 home runs, 206 RBI and 16 stolen bases over 2,071 plate appearances with Boston. He also led the American League in outfield assists in 2020 and 2023.\nIn return, Boston will get Weissert and two pitching prospects headlined by Fitts \u2014 the Yankees' No. 4-ranked pitching prospect and 12-ranked prospect overall.\nRelievers Yates, Devenski get one-year deals for 2024\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic and Jeff Passan, ESPN\nVeteran relievers Kirby Yates and Chris Devenski know where they'll be pitching in 2024, according to reports Tuesday.\nYates, who will be 37 when the season begins, is headed to the Rangers on a one-year deal, per Rosenthal. The right-hander, an All-Star closer for the Padres in 2019, posted a 3.28 ERA in 61 appearances for the Braves in 2023.\nDevenski, 33, has agreed to a new one-year deal with the Rays that includes a club option for 2025, according to Passan. Devenski began 2023 with the Angels but was released in late August and signed with Tampa Bay. He posted a 5.08 ERA in 29 games for the Angels and dropped three full runs off that number in nine games with the Rays.\nDave Roberts says Dodgers met with Ohtani\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Alden Gonzalez, ESPN\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters Tuesday that the team met with Ohtani for 2-3 hours over the weekend. Roberts said Ohtani is \"clearly\" the Dodgers' top priority, adding that the team is confident the two-time MVP will pitch again. Roberts wasn't able to offer a timeline for Ohtani's decision.\nPair of pitchers could be signed after Ohtani deal\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nMLB is largely in a holding pattern as it awaits news on Ohtani. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported the Rays could wind up trading Tyler Glasnow shortly after Ohtani signs, listing the Cubs and Reds as top contenders for the ace. He also reported Yoshinobu Yamamoto could sign following Ohtani's deal, and that the Red Sox have him among their top priorities.\nCubs losing optimism in signing Ohtani\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Bob Nightengale, USA Today\nThe Cubs have been viewed as one of Ohtani's likeliest destinations for a while. It appears that might no longer be the case. USA Today's Bob Nightengale reported one high-ranking executive believes the Cubs' optimism of signing Ohtani \"has now significantly wanted.\" The report stated that leaves the Dodgers, Blue Jays, Angels and Giants as the remaining finalists.\nOhtani has 'positive feeling' about Blue Jays\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Jon Heyman, The New York Post\nThe Blue Jays reported met with Ohtani on Monday, but even before he went to talk with the team, Ohtani reportedly had a \"positive feeling about Toronto,\" along with other cities and teams, including the Dodgers. He has been linked to Toronto and Los Angeles throughout the process.\nMariners considering Cody Bellinger\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nFollowing the trade the Mariners made with the Braves, MLB Network's Jon Morosi believes Seattle has cleared payroll space and now has room to make a splash for top free agent slugger Cody Bellinger. Seattle has Julio Rodriguez in center, but with Teoscar Hernandez still on the market and Jarred Kelenic now dealt, there is room for him in the outfield.\nBlue Jays 'believed' to have met with Shohei Ohtani\nDate: Monday, Dec. 4\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic\nWhile one report earlier Monday indicated Ohtani isn't expected to sign before the end of the Winter Meetings, the process seems to be moving along.\nThe Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports Ohtani is \"believed\" to have met with the Blue Jays at the team's complex in Florida on Monday, far away from the meetings in Nashville. The Blue Jays have been pursuing Ohtani and Juan Soto in hopes of striking a deal for one of the two stars.\nShohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto decision not expected until after winter meetings\nDate: Monday, Dec. 4\nSource: Jon Heyman, The New York Post\nThe baseball markets are waiting for the first major domino to fall this offseason in free agency, but it does not appear as though that will happen before the winter meetings conclude. Jon Heyman reports that neither Shohei Ohtani not Yoshinobu Yamamoto are expected to get a deal done before the final meetings on Wednesday.\nWade Miley back with Brewers on 1-year deal\nDate: Monday, Dec. 4\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic and Jesse Rogers, ESPN\nAmid a turbulent offseason, the Brewers will keep one piece of their rotation intact as Wade Miley has agreed to return on a one-year deal for 2024 with a mutual option for 2025, per Rosenthal.

According to MLB Network's Jon Morosi, the Braves are \"engaged\" in talks with Ohtani's camp. Imagine a lineup consisting of Ohtani, Ronald Acuna Jr., Ozzie Albies, Austin Riley and Matt Olson?\nSources: Braves are among the teams still engaged with Shohei Ohtani\u2019s camp, as I reported in this @MLBNetwork segment. @MLB pic.twitter.com\/lP4lISzttN \u2014 Jon Morosi (@jonmorosi) December 4, 2023\nKorean star Jung Hoo Lee to be posted Monday\nDate: Monday, Dec. 4\nSource: Jeeho Yoo, Yonhap News\nStar Korean outfielder Jung Hoo Lee is set for a move to MLB. His KBO team, Kiwoom Heroes, announced the 25-year-old will be posted Monday, so his 30-day negotiating window with MLB teams begins Tuesday at 8 a.m. ET.\nLee was hampered by injury in 2023 but slashed .349\/.421\/.575 in 2022 with 36 doubles, 10 triples and a career-best 23 home runs.

The 24-year-old has not found any consistency in his MLB career thus far, hitting .206 with a .656 OPS through three tumultuous seasons. He has 32 home runs, 109 RBI and 24 stolen bases in 974 plate appearances.\nGonzales, 31, is also a decent rotation arm with 65 wins, 665 strikeouts and a 4.14 ERA over 893.0 innings pitched in his nine-year career.\nGiants emerging as possible frontrunners for Yoshinobu Yamamoto\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\nSource: Susan Slusser, San Francisco Chronicle\nThe Giants have missed out on big names in the past like Aaron Judge and Carlos Correa, but they are looking to turn that around in 2023 with heavy involvement and Ohtani, among others. Per San Francisco Chronicle's Susan Slusser, teams believe the Giants \"might have an edge\" in the pursuit of Japanese ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto.\nDylan Cease trade market heating up\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nOne of the biggest names on the market early is White Sox ace Dylan Cease in trade talks. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported three teams, the Dodgers, Braves and Orioles, are among several involved discussing a deal for Cease as the winter meetings begin.\nRays, Mariners talking trades in winter meetings\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nThe Mariners and Rays have been frequent trade partners in recent years, and there's a chance they could be talking shop again at the winter meetings. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported the teams are discussing Rays utility infielder Isaac Paredes, and potentially star left fielder Randy Arozarena, in talks to start the winter meetings.\nJays unlikely to land both Ohtani, Soto\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nThe Blue Jays have been among the most active names in both the Ohtani and Soto markets. And of course, those talks have had fans dreaming of a lineup that features, Ohtani, Soto, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette and George Springer. But MLB Network's Jon Morosi said it's unlikely the Jays will land both star players, reporting they might land one of the two, but they will not add both this offseason.\nOhtani has already received several $500+ million offers\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\nSource: Jon Heyman, NY Post\nIt's no surprise the bidding for Ohtani is heating up, with the star expected to sign soon. And New York Post's Jon Heyman reported Ohtani has already received several deals that have topped $500 million, which could mean he winds up being the first $600 million player in MLB history. He added there are believed to be five teams in the running for Ohtani.\nDecision near for Ohtani\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nNothing gets the hot-stove crowd excited like a big move during the winter meetings, and the biggest move of the offseason could come this week in Nashville or soon after. Morosi reports Shohei Ohtani is \"likely to decide on a team within the next week,\" according to a source.\nStatus quo on Yankees' Juan Soto trade talks\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 3\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\nThe Yankees reportedly are pushing hard to acquire Juan Soto from the Padres, but Heyman says the teams haven't spoken since San Diego requested a six-player package in return for Soto and Trent Grisham. That ask included pitchers Michael King and Drew Thorpe, who the Yankees aren't inclined to move. Stay tuned...\nShohei Ohtani field growing smaller\nDate: Friday, Dec. 1\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\nIt has been expected since before he hit free agency that Ohtani would set the record for the largest fully guaranteed contract in North American sports history, with Passan reporting the deal could reach as much as $600 million.\nWho will hand him that contract has been much more of a mystery. Little has been leaked about the top suitors for Ohtani beyond the usual suspects. Passan reported that at least three teams initially believed to be in the running \u2014 the Mets, Rangers and Red Sox \u2014 are believed to be out now. The teams most likely to still be in the mix are the Dodgers, Cubs, Blue Jays and Angels, with the Giants' status in the race for Ohtani unknown.\nStar players could be traded\nDate: Friday, Dec. 1\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\nThe free agency pool outside of Ohtani, Cody Bellinger, Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto is a bit lacking in star power, but the trade market could ensure several big-name players are on the move this offseason.\nPassan reported a trade of Soto appears to be \"edging closer to becoming a reality,\" and while several teams are out on him because of his large salary and pending free-agent status, there still could be a large market for the star outfielder.\nMuch of the rest of the names on the trade market are arms. Dylan Cease and Tyler Glasnow are the pitchers most likely to be dealt this offseason, and Cleveland could also hold a pair of intriguing trade chips in closer Emmanuel Clase and former Cy Young winner Shane Bieber. The Brewers have also begun trade talks for former Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes.\n\nThis article, authored by Edward Sutelan, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-03 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":120}
{"title":"In the end, the FTX trial was about the friends screwed along the way","context":"## In the end, the FTX trial was about the friends screwed along the way\n\nSure, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial has revealed that FTX was basically a seething mass of scams. But it has also revealed how Bankman-Fried blew up the lives of the people who are closest to him.\nOf course everyone who had money trapped on the FTX exchange when it collapsed \u2014 as the result of Bankman-Fried\u2019s trading firm Alameda Research purloining its customers\u2019 funds \u2014 had their lives altered. Even if they are made whole by the bankruptcy proceedings, that\u2019s still money that they should have had access to at any time they wanted it. That may mean houses that weren\u2019t purchased, medical procedures that were left undone, and life savings lost.\nThere is a simultaneous drama of ruined lives playing out in the courtroom\nBankman-Fried is charged with seven counts: two counts of wire fraud and five conspiracy charges. As we near the end of the prosecution\u2019s case, I have been struck by how bizarre it all is. All the co-conspirators seem oddly younger than their years, as though they got stuck in the \u201cmath camp forever\u201d environment Bankman-Fried created for them and simply failed to grow up.\nThe prosecution has made a strong case that Bankman-Fried presided over the various forms of fraud that played out at Alameda Research and FTX, orchestrating some of it and engaging in some of it directly. In the process of making this case, there is a simultaneous drama of ruined lives playing out in the courtroom.\nEveryone who loved Bankman-Fried most in the world is now caught up in the case. We have:\nAdam Yedidia, Bankman-Fried\u2019s college roommate, who testified with immunity because he was concerned he may have unknowingly worked on code that contributed to the fraud. \u201cI love you Sam,\u201d he texted at one point. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d That was before he realized FTX had stolen customer funds \u2014 at which point, he resigned.\nGary Wang, the co-founder of FTX and Alameda Research and another college roommate. He took the stand after Yedidia and sang like a canary about the secret privileges he\u2019d created for Alameda in the FTX code.\nNishad Singh, a longtime family friend, who copped to what sounded an awful lot like classic embezzlement. He said he\u2019d backdated transactions on FTX to help create doctored balance sheets to show to investors. He pleaded guilty to six charges, including wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy counts around his political donations.\nCaroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried\u2019s ex-girlfriend. She told us about the seven phony balance sheets she\u2019d created. She was clear: Alameda took customer funds; Bankman-Fried knew about it and even invested them against her advice.\nJoe Bankman, Bankman-Fried\u2019s father. He is among the people included in the \u201csmall group chat,\u201d the Signal group where the FTX inner circle strategized during the exchange\u2019s last days.\nBarbara Fried\u2019s political action committee, Mind the Gap. It is among the entities that received FTX customer money as political donations. Fried and Bankman lived together in a Bahamas house purchased for them using FTX investor funds, according to a financial expert called by the prosecution; in a lawsuit filed by FTX\u2019s bankruptcy estate, Bankman and Fried are alleged to have been given $10 million of FTX customer funds.\nGabe Bankman-Fried\u2019s nonprofit, Guarding Against Pandemics, which got millions from FTX. He was also in a Signal group chat, Donations Processing, that Singh says was used to coordinate the transfer of FTX and Alameda money to various political causes. In that chat, he can be seen recommending some donations be made \u201cin the dark\u201d to avoid public relations headaches. Singh also said Gabe had an assistant fly to the Bahamas with a stack of blank checks for Singh to sign.\nWang, Singh, and Ellison are now felons. Even if they never do time \u2014 and they may very well be imprisoned or subjected to house arrest \u2014 their lives are irrevocably changed, not least by whatever restitution requirements they are subjected to. They are barred from taking certain kinds of jobs. And of course, there is the publicity. Bankman, Fried, and Gabe Bankman-Fried\u2019s reputations are tarnished; in the political arenas where they once operated, they are suddenly undesirable.\nIt is a Greek tragedy, precipitated by one man\u2019s character flaw: the arrogance of Sam Bankman-Fried.\nThe general sense I got, from the testimony of Bankman-Fried\u2019s former friends, was that things just kept escalating\nDuring Yedidia\u2019s testimony, we were shown a photograph in court: former President Bill Clinton and former Prime Minister Tony Blair onstage in suits next to Bankman-Fried, in a rumpled T-shirt and cargo shorts. Sure, dressing down is a staple of Silicon Valley startup culture \u2014 and a sign of its swagger. The defense counsel tried to elicit testimony from Yedidia that the cargo shorts were evidence of Bankman-Fried\u2019s humility, but the photograph seemed to signify just the opposite: that the man in cargo shorts is so important, he doesn\u2019t need to dress up, even to meet former world leaders.\nNow, in court, Bankman-Fried is wearing a suit.\nIn 2019, just months after FTX was founded, Wang oversaw code called \u201callow_negative\u201d that let Alameda Research avoid being liquidated by FTX\u2019s risk management. It was turned on in July. No other customer trading on FTX had \u201callow_negative\u201d privileges \u2014 only Alameda. Wang\u2019s testimony suggests that the fraud at FTX started very early since the same day that allow_negative was switched on, Bankman-Fried tweeted that Alameda\u2019s account \u201cwas like everyone else\u2019s.\u201d\nThe general sense I got, from the testimony of Bankman-Fried\u2019s former friends, was that things just kept escalating. For instance, Alameda Research first had a negative balance in late 2019, Wang testified. Wang testified that he heard Bankman-Fried tell another trader that it was okay to continue withdrawing money from the account as long as the amount was less than FTX\u2019s total trading revenue. A little later, Wang discovered that Alameda was negative by $50 million more than FTX\u2019s revenue. Bankman-Fried told him it was fine, and it just didn\u2019t account for the FTT token that the two of them had launched. Wang trusted him.\nWang also set Alameda Research up with an enormous line of credit, unmatched by anyone else on FTX. Ultimately, the number was $65 billion \u2014 the result of repeated increases as Alameda Research repeatedly ran up against its credit limit. This line of capital wasn\u2019t visible to auditors, Ellison testified. That credit line was used primarily for trading because it \u201callowed us to make profitable trades we couldn\u2019t have made otherwise,\u201d Ellison testified.\n\u201cOver time, it was something I became more comfortable with.\u201d\nWang\u2019s testimony revealed how the fraud got bigger, little by little. First, it was okay to dip into FTX\u2019s profits. Then, it was okay to take more. Then, it was okay to take even more. First, it was a little line of credit just to provide liquidity. Then a bigger one. Then an effectively limitless one.\nEllison testified to something similar, choking back tears: \u201cWhen I started working at Alameda, I don\u2019t think I would have believed you if you told me I would be sending false balance sheets to our lenders or taking customer money, but over time, it was something I became more comfortable with.\u201d\nEllison\u2019s tenure as CEO of Alameda Research was an exercise in optics, she testified. Alameda Research was, by then, FTX\u2019s sin-eater. When FTX took a loss in the hundreds of million dollars because a trader had exploited its system, Wang moved that loss onto Alameda\u2019s balance sheet. FTX\u2019s \u201cinsurance fund,\u201d meant to keep traders from getting stuck with other traders\u2019 losses, was totally made up \u2014 Alameda simply picked up the tab.\nEven that wasn\u2019t good enough. Singh testified to sprucing up FTX\u2019s balance sheet with backdated transactions in December 2021 to push FTX\u2019s revenue \u201cover the line\u201d to $1 billion. By the time Singh found out about the use of customer money, in 2022, he was already compromised.\nAt every turn, the scams at FTX and Alameda led back to making Bankman-Fried more important\nIn Singh\u2019s case, it wasn\u2019t just balance sheets he was fiddling with \u2014 it was also the American political system. By coordinating with Gabe Bankman-Fried, Singh had funneled money to a number of political causes. That money came from \u201cloans,\u201d which weren\u2019t really loans since he hadn\u2019t signed any term sheets.\nWhat was the goal here? What was accomplished? Singh testified to more than a billion dollars spent on celebrity endorsements, which made FTX very famous \u2014 even though the futures platform didn\u2019t operate in the US. The political donations gave Bankman-Fried influence in the highest echelons of power. Ellison testified to Bankman-Fried\u2019s venture investments, which gave him more dominance in the tech world. At every turn, the scams at FTX and Alameda led back to making Bankman-Fried more important.\nThe pie chart that accompanied expert witness Peter Easton\u2019s testimony. Image: The prosecution\u2019s exhibit 1045\nThis was backed up by expert testimony from Notre Dame accounting professor Peter Easton, who\u2019d also assisted in investigating Enron and WorldCom. In a pie chart that showed how he\u2019d traced funds for the $11.3 billion liability that Ellison, Singh, Wang, and Bankman-Fried had known about in June 2022, we saw that $1.2 billion was a loan repayment to crypto lender Genesis. A substantial chunk had been spent on various investments, including in the celebrity-connected venture firm K5, trading firm Modulo (co-founded by one of Bankman-Fried\u2019s ex-girlfriends), and AI company Anthropic.\nAnother $413 million had gone directly to Bankman-Fried himself, through his wholly-owned company Paper Bird. \u201cOutflows to insiders,\u201d which suggested Singh\u2019s not-quite-loans were included, was $192 million; real estate was another $228 million; and the donations to Gabe Bankman-Fried\u2019s Guarding Against Pandemics, combined with the philanthropy from the FTX Foundation, totaled less than $40 million.\nIt is easy to lie with words and harder to lie with money. Bankman-Fried went around telling people that he wanted to make a lot of money to give it away, an idea of the Effective Altruism movement that Bankman-Fried affiliated himself with \u2014 but the amount of money he funneled to his Paper Bird vehicle alone was ten times the size of his philanthropic spending as outlined by Easton. And it was all vastly outweighed by his investments \u2014 the places where he could prove he was very smart by investing in the right companies early.\nAnd in brief, explosive testimony, former FTX lawyer Can Sun demonstrated what Bankman-Fried\u2019s tactic was. During the days in November when the exchange imploded, Bankman-Fried was trying to raise money from Apollo, the private equity group. Apollo wanted an explanation for what had happened, and so Bankman-Fried came to Sun to ask him to come up with justifications for the missing funds.\nThe defense has struggled to shake the credibility of witnesses such as Yedidia, Wang, and Ellison\nThat \u201cbasically confirmed my suspicions that had been rising all day\u201d that Bankman-Fried had purloined the funds, Sun said. He ran Bankman-Fried through possible explanations, including a margin loan program, and explained that none of them could fit the actual situation \u2014 for instance, Alameda had borrowed more from FTX than had ever been in the margin loan program. He said Bankman-Fried acknowledged their conversation with a \u201cyup, yup.\u201d \u201cI was expecting a bigger response, but it was very muted,\u201d Sun said.\nAfter that, Singh spilled the beans: Alameda had withdrawn assets that included the customer funds, Sun testified. He quit the next day. Like Yedidia, Sun testified with immunity.\nIn the courtroom, we were treated to a Good Morning America appearance by Bankman-Fried on December 1st, 2022. In it, Bankman-Fried tried to justify the missing funds through the margin loan program. It was such a flimsy excuse that even George Stephanopoulos could see through it.\nDid Bankman-Fried really think he could get away with it all? He must still think so, or he would not be dragging his closest companions\u2019 names through the mud in a jury trial. Throughout the entire prosecution\u2019s case, the defense has struggled to shake the credibility of witnesses such as Yedidia, Wang, and Ellison. The hits the defense made on Singh didn\u2019t make me doubt the overall truth of his story \u2014 they just made me think that Singh was kind of self-serving and trying to secure himself a lenient sentence.\n\nThis article, authored by Elizabeth Lopatto, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-26 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":121}

However, for the best results, follow Northwar\u2019s path exactly.\nHow to make a great Sorcerer build\nSorcerers are Diablo 4\u2019s pure caster class, and use elemental magic to differentiate from the spells of the Druid and Necromancer. The Sorcerer has six Key Passives, but only three elements, which is what you\u2019ll base your build around:\nLightning\nFire\nIce\nLightning builds utilize Lightning skills to deal with large groups of enemies at once. When making a Lightning build, you\u2019ll end up using the Overflowing Energy Key Passive or the Vyr\u2019s Master Key Passive, depending on if you\u2019re in melee range or not.\nIce builds specialize in slowing enemies down, making it easier to survive their attacks. Ice builds will take advantage of either the Avalanche Key Passive or the Shatter Key Passive, depending on how much your build relies on crowd control\nFire builds are all about big explosions and burning your enemies. For these builds, you\u2019ll typically use either the Combustion Key Passive for burning enemies or the Esu\u2019s Ferocity Key Passive for chunky critical strikes.\nWhen making your own build for a Sorcerer, you\u2019ll likely end up sticking to one element for your main damage sources. But that\u2019s not the most important thing you need to remember. Sorcerers die very, very easily in Diablo 4, and they have the weakest defensive stats by far \u2014 however, they can deal a massive amount of damage when built correctly. If you don\u2019t want to end up dead more often than not, make sure to invest heavily in defensive skills while making your way toward one of the six Key Passives we listed above.\nLooking for other Diablo 4 builds? We have explainers on the Barbarian, Rogue, Druid, and Necromancer classes.\n\nThis article, authored by Ryan Gilliam, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-18 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":122}

There are four main ideas that all Barbarian builds stem from:\nFury dumping (most popular in Diablo 4\u2019s pre-season)\nWeapon swapping\nBleed\nBerserk\nFury dump builds make use of the Unbridled Rage Key Passive, which causes your Fury spenders to cost double the Fury but deal more than double the damage. These kinds of builds obviously require very steady Fury generation, as it\u2019s easy to starve yourself. Berserk builds that use the Unconstrained Key Passive are all about keeping your Barbarian in the Berserk stage at all times, which nets you a hefty bonus. All Barbarian builds will likely use some skills that make them go Berserk, the Unconstrained Key Passive just enhances the effect.\nBleed builds use the Gushing Wounds Key Passive to create a critical strike heavy build that\u2019s great for whittling down groups of enemies with damage over time and explosions. Weapon swapping builds offer what is almost certainly the most unique playstyle for Barbarians and takes advantage of the Walking Arsenal Key Passive. The idea here is that you\u2019re constantly swapping between your skills and weapons to give yourself massive damage buffs.\nWhen making a build, you want to have one of these Key Passives in mind and choose your skills accordingly. Thankfully skills that share certain aspects (like Bleed) are color-coded on the skill tree, and you can even use the in-game search function to find them all. Other Barbarian builds let you take advantage of mechanics like Thorns or Shouts. But they still typically end with one of these Key Passives.\nLooking for other Diablo 4 builds?

{"title":"People are turning to Snap Map for firsthand perspectives from Gaza","context":"## People are turning to Snap Map for firsthand perspectives from Gaza\n\nThe world is watching the humanitarian crisis in Gaza unfold in real time through firsthand accounts documented on, of all places, Snapchat.\nIsrael has retaliated against Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack with unprecedented force against the Palestinian territory, claiming over 9,000 Palestinian lives according to Gaza Health Ministry numbers reported by the Associated Press.\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists reports that at least 30 journalists have been killed since Israel\u2019s bombardment and total blockade of the region began, and journalists in Gaza say that without consistent access to food, water and power, it\u2019s becoming \u201cimpossible\u201d to continue reporting. Misinformation about the escalating violence is rampant on social media.\nAmid calls for a ceasefire, TikTok and X (formerly Twitter) users are urging followers to view the devastation of Gaza for themselves on Snap Maps, which has displayed hot spots throughout northern Gaza since the Israeli airstrikes started last month. You don\u2019t need an account to view Snap Map \u2014 the desktop version of the map is publicly accessible.\n\u201cSnap Maps is a WEALTH of real-time information and is an important source for all journalists who aren\u2019t on the ground right now,\u201d X user inejmydarling posted.\nSnap didn\u2019t provide TechCrunch with hard data, but confirmed to TechCrunch that since October 7, the company has seen a \u201cmoderate\u201d increase in submissions to public Stories from Gaza. The company also said that more people from around the world are viewing content from the region. In the weeks since Israel\u2019s blockade of the territory began, screen recordings of the map, which displays bright red hotspots throughout northern Gaza, have been shared online.\nIn recent videos posted from Gaza City on Thursday night, for example, users recorded bombings from their windows. Videos posted from the previous morning showed smoke rising from remaining buildings, demolished neighborhoods and people crowding around medical vehicles for treatment.\nI\u2019m begging you guys to please PLEASE check snap maps. Look at the difference between the living conditions just a few miles away. The people of Gaza are posting these publicly for us to see and share. Please listen to them. These are all from today. You can check yourselves pic.twitter.com\/L7LWjigk5t \u2014 \ud835\udcdc \u2740 \u25d3 (@uchihassasusaku) October 29, 2023\nSnap Map first launched in 2017 as a location-sharing feature that lets users see where their friends are posting Stories from, displayed on an interactive map. Users can also share their content to \u201cOur Story,\u201d a collaborative public archive of Stories posted from popular locations, which are displayed as hotspots on a \u201cheat map.\u201d If many users are posting Stories from around the same location, like a music festival, it\u2019ll show up on the heat map.\nIn the years since Snap Map launched, it\u2019s become an unexpected resource for keeping up with current events and highlighting political protests. Following the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida in 2018, students used the map to document and archive the nationwide classroom walkout demanding stricter gun control. During the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, Snapchat users posted videos expressing solidarity and recording instances of police violence against protestors.\nThis also isn\u2019t the first time that Snap Map has been used to demonstrate the disparity between Israeli cities and occupied Palestinian territories. The May 2021 court ruling to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah prompted weeks of protests internationally, and violent fighting between Hamas and Israel. On Snapchat\u2019s heat map, Stories posted throughout Israel showed users washing their cars and celebrating their birthdays. Stories posted from Gaza documented a neighborhood reduced to rubble.\nSnap Map is especially relevant as other mapping sites limit features in the region at the request of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). Google disabled live traffic conditions in Israel and the Gaza Strip for Google Maps and Waze last week, Bloomberg reports, \u201cout of consideration for the safety of local communities.\u201d Users can still use navigational features to get around, but aren\u2019t able to see real-time traffic data, according to Bloomberg, because live updates could reveal the Israeli military\u2019s movements. The Hill reports that Apple Maps took similar action in compliance with the IDF\u2019s request.\nThe company isn\u2019t indifferent to geopolitical conflict, however. Last year, Snap disabled its heat map in Ukraine as a \u201csafety precaution,\u201d The Verge said, to prevent Russia from tracking civilian evacuations. Instead, Snap displayed a \u201ccurated feed\u201d of public Stories.\nA spokesperson for Snap told TechCrunch that Snap Map will stay live to allow users to continue sharing their experiences during the crisis, and that the company is monitoring hot spots for content that may spread misinformation or incite violence. Snap will \u201cclosely assess\u201d if it needs to take additional action.\nThe spokesperson also acknowledged that Snap Map is a crucial resource for \u201cauthentic user-generated content\u201d from perspectives that may not be reflected by traditional news outlets.\nSnap Map has served as an alternative source of eyewitness accounts during times of social unrest, as young people increasingly perceive news media reporting as \u201cbiased.\u201d Trust in legacy media is waning in younger generations \u2014 a 2022 Pew Research Center survey found that American adults under 30 trust information from social media nearly as much as they trust information from national news outlets. A report conducted by the Knight Foundation earlier this year concluded that perceptions of political bias in news have increased, and young people hold more negative perceptions of news media than their predecessors. Younger people also consume the most online news, but report the lowest trust in national news outlets.\nAlthough Snapchat isn\u2019t immune to misinformation, it\u2019s worth noting that spreading fake content via Our Story isn\u2019t as easy as reposting a video on X or TikTok. Users can upload content from their camera roll to their own Stories, but it won\u2019t be eligible for Our Stories. Snap encourages users to \u201ccapture what\u2019s happening\u201d around them to increase their chances of making it to Our Stories. The submission guidelines say that the company looks for \u201cSnaps that provide a window into everyday life.\u201d\nUsers are also turning to Snapchat for information about Gaza as accusations of shadowbanning Palestinian content fuel distrust in platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Meta\u2019s policies aren\u2019t dissimilar to Snap\u2019s Community Guidelines, which prohibit pornographic content, content that advocates or advances terrorism and content that portrays gratuitous or graphic violence. Allegations of censorship against Snapchat aren\u2019t as frequent as they are against Meta\u2019s platforms, but many users are still urging others to screen record Stories posted from Gaza in case they are taken down.\nSome are also concerned that internet access in Gaza, which was partially restored after Israel imposed a communications blackout, will be cut again. TikTok creator divergentredhed posted that she watched the blackout happen in real time on Snapchat.\n\u201cRight there in Gaza it was like a hotspot of Snapchat Stories. It was yellow and green and red \u2026 all of it just went dark. The entire Gaza Strip went dark before my very eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to spend the next few days uploading all of the content I have from Snapchat, from the people themselves.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Morgan Sung, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-03 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":124}
{"title":"\"There are no sacred numbers\"","context":"## \"There are no sacred numbers\"\n\nThe first week of fighting in the bitter war in Israel\u2019s south is almost over, with the financial markets trying to gauge the damage that the Israeli economy will sustain. Clearly, we are talking about a very significant event, but the fog of war makes it hard to estimate its full consequences. The main index on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, the Tel Aviv 35, fell 6.4% over the week.\nProf. Leo Leiderman, chief economic adviser at Bank Hapoalim and a professor of economics at Tel Aviv University, sets out for \"Globes\" his proposals for rehabilitating the economy and repairing the damage that the war will cause.\nWhat has been going through your mind in these first days of the war?\n\"What most preoccupies me is not the economy but concern for the families of the soldiers, the wounded, and the captives, and solidarity with them. I have four relatives from Kibbutz Nir Oz who are still missing, and we have no information about them. I find it hard to understand how a war like this landed on us in a country as powerful as Israel. But we have no choice but to win.\"\nAs for the effect of the war on economic activity, Leiderman says: \"First of all, the duration and character of the war will have a decisive impact on the depth of damage to the economy. Many studies, as well as past experience, indicate that the longer the war lasts, the broader will be the impact on the economy. It is also known that this connection between the length of the fighting and the economic damage might not be linear. And of course, the more the war widens to more fronts, the greater will be the economic damage.\"\nDo you have a forecast for the consequences of the war for economic growth?\n\"It\u2019s too early to make a quantitative estimate of the effects on the growth of the economy in 2024 and 2025. We have a great deal of information about loss of growth and product in various episodes in the past, such as the Yom Kippur War, the Lebanon War, two intifadas, various military operations, and the Covid pandemic.\n\"We see this is a completely different episode, however. This is a new situation that has no precedent as far as the damage to the economy is concerned. There\u2019s a whole spectrum of possible scenarios, from a short war on the southern front only, to the nightmare scenario of a prolonged war with additional sectors involved. We are only in the fifth day of the war, and it\u2019s to be hoped that the picture will start to become clearer.\"\nWhich industries will be hit by the war?\n\"A substantial decline can be expected in private consumption, particularly of services. This is not just because of the damage to output and income, but also for psychological reasons. Distress, uncertainty, the possibility of prolonged reserve duty by some of the public - all these things will affect consumer sentiment. Alongside this, tourism, commerce, transport services, entertainment, and restaurants will be hurt. As in the Covid pandemic, the self-employed and small and medium-size businesses may be hurt, particularly those that operate with high leverage.\"\nOn Monday, the Bank of Israel announced a dramatic plan to sell $30 billion of its foreign currency reserves to stabilize the shekel. The shekel has in fact recovered slightly, and is traded at around NIS 3.96\/$.\nWhat\u2019s your view of the Bank of Israel\u2019s move in the foreign exchange market?\nLeiderman: \"It\u2019s important to welcome the Bank of Israel\u2019s decision to intervene, as necessary, in the foreign exchange market, in order to ensure the market\u2019s regular operation. The decision to extend the term of Amir Yaron as governor of the bank at least for the duration of the war, and I hope beyond that, is also a stabilizing factor. The banking system is stable, and there is enough liquidity in the system. The behavior of the investment community in Israel, including the financial institutions, indicates high confidence in the economy\u2019s resilience and financial strength. It\u2019s important to maintain a level-headed, correct economic policy that will preserve this \u2018asset.\u2019\"\nWhat about the economic cost of the war?\n\"As with any war, the current war has and will have direct and indirect impacts. The war will substantially raise defense spending in the coming years, for procurement of equipment, ammunition, and advanced systems in accordance with the new needs. Another direct expense is payment for the reserve duty days of those mobilized. Given current interest rate levels around the world, the cost of servicing public debt as a proportion of GDP will rise. Besides all this, there will be a decline in state revenues from taxation and a rise in the fiscal deficit.\"\nHow can this larger deficit be financed?\n\"It\u2019s reasonable to argue that besides the hope of financing part of the deficit through aid from the US (President Biden approved $8 billion military aid this week, H. S.), and that will happen, it\u2019s permissible for a country at war to raise its fiscal deficit by what is seen as the right amount. This is in order to ensure that the economy functions properly, to carry out rehabilitation actions, and to prepare for recovery and a return to growth in the near future.\"\nHow high should the deficit go?\n\"I mean a deficit of 3% of GDP, or 5%, or 8% - there are no sacred numbers. As was said during the Covid pandemic, the state has to do whatever it takes to achieve these goals. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important to make sure that the growth in expenditure and in the deficit is temporary, until economic activity gets back to normal. I\u2019m also sure that there are various budget items that were approved that don\u2019t support economic growth, and that don\u2019t need to be implemented in the new reality. Such a policy will be accepted with complete understanding by investors overseas and in Israel, and also by the credit rating agencies.\"\nWhat else do you propose on the economic policy plane?\n\"Despite the uncertainty over how the war will develop, alongside an emergency budget, this is the time to start preparing a general economic plan with a strategy for rehabilitating the economy after the war. It\u2019s important to start planning professionally and in detail all aspects of rehabilitating the settlements that have been damaged or destroyed in the south, rehabilitation of infrastructure, the health system, and the civilian systems that need attention.\"\nHow do you propose doing this?\n\"One possibility is to task the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance Budgets Division with coordinating the work, with help from the various research institutes and economists, engineers, and professionals in academic institutions and in the private sector. It\u2019s important to talk to the private sector, and to understand in every place and every industry what the main damage is and what they need in order to get back to normal. It should be done professionally, preferably with no politicization of the recommendations.\"\nWhat do you think the Bank of Israel should do in its next interest rate decision, on October 23?\n\"It\u2019s still to early to tell how the war will affect the rate of inflation in the short and medium term. Just as there are new inflationary factors, such as the depreciation of the shekel, there will also be factors working in the opposite direction, given the expected decline in private consumption, tourism, and other items.\n\"As with fiscal policy, here too a country at war is allowed to deviate temporarily from the set inflation target. At the moment there is no surge in inflation expectations, and the investment community is aware of the existence of index-linked assets and the exchange rate that can assist in hedging inflation risk.\n\"As for cutting the interest rate, it\u2019s too early to consider that. The current interest rate is at the right level for the state of the economy, and together with the policy on exchange rates, it contributes to ensuring financial stability,\" Leiderman concludes.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on October 12, 2023.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023.\n\nThis article, authored by Hezi Sternlicht, was published by Globes English | Israel Business Arena on 2023-10-12 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":125}
{"title":"Early impressions of Google\u2019s Gemini aren\u2019t great","context":"## Early impressions of Google\u2019s Gemini aren\u2019t great\n\nThis week, Google took the wraps off of Gemini, its new flagship generative AI model meant to power a range of products and services including Bard, Google\u2019s ChatGPT competitor. In blog posts and press materials, Google touted Gemini\u2019s superior architecture and capabilities, claiming that the model meets or exceeds the performance of other leading gen AI models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.\nBut the anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise.\nA \u201clite\u201d version of Gemini, Gemini Pro, began rolling out to Bard yesterday, and it didn\u2019t take long before users began voicing their frustrations with it on X (formerly Twitter).\nThe model fails to get basic facts right, like 2023 Oscar winners:\nI'm extremely disappointed with Gemini Pro on Bard. It still give very, very bad results to questions that shouldn't be hard anymore with RAG. A simple question like this with a simple answer like this, and it still got it WRONG. pic.twitter.com\/5GowXtscRU \u2014 Vitor de Lucca \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 \/ threads.net\/@vitor_dlucca (@vitor_dlucca) December 7, 2023\nNote that Gemini Pro claims incorrectly that Brendan Gleeson won Best Actor last year, not Brendan Fraser \u2014 the actual winner.\nI tried asking the model the same question and, bizarrely, it gave a different wrong answer:\n\u201cNavalny,\u201d not \u201cAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed,\u201d won Best Documentary Feature last year; \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d won Best International Film; \u201cWomen Talking\u201d won Best Adapted Screenplay; and \u201cPinocchio\u201d won Best Animated Feature Film. That\u2019s a lot of mistakes.\nScience fiction author Charlie Stross found many more examples of confabulation in a recent blog post. (Among other mistruths, Gemini Pro said that Stross contributed to the Linux kernel; he never has.)\nTranslation doesn\u2019t appear to be Gemini Pro\u2019s strong suit, either. It struggles to give a six-letter word in French:\nFYI, Google Gemini is complete trash. pic.twitter.com\/EfNzTa5qas \u2014 Benjamin Netter (@benjaminnetter) December 6, 2023\nWhen I ran the same prompt through Bard (\u201cCan you give me a 6-letters word in French?\u201d), Gemini Pro responded with a seven-letter word instead of a five-letter one \u2014 which gives some credence to the reports about Gemini\u2019s poor multilingual performance.\nWhat about summarizing news? Surely Gemini Pro, with Google Search and Google News at its disposal, can give a recap of something topical? Not necessarily.\nIt seems Gemini Pro is loath to comment on potentially controversial news topics, instead telling users to\u2026 Google it themselves.\nI tried the same prompt and got a very similar response. ChatGPT, by contrast, gives a bullet-list summary with citations to news articles:\nInterestingly, Gemini Pro did provide a summary of updates on the war in Ukraine when I asked it for one. However, the information was over a month out of date:\nGoogle emphasized Gemini\u2019s enhanced coding skills in a briefing earlier this week. Perhaps it\u2019s genuinely improved in some areas \u2014 posts on X suggest as much. But it also appears that Gemini Pro struggles with basic coding functions like this one in Python:\nTried gemini based Bard, and well, it still can't write intersection of two polygons. It's one of those rare relatively simple to express functions that wasn't ever implemented in python, there is no stack overflow post, and all these models fail on it. pic.twitter.com\/RKjmkEw2Qr \u2014 Filip Piekniewski\ud83c\udf3b \ud83d\udc18:@filippie509@techhub.social (@filippie509) December 6, 2023\nAnd these:\nTrying out Gemini Pro: it is pretty disappointing for my example. I asked it to make an analog clock using HTML like this one that ChatGPT made. It can cite some code from Github but it's off by a few ms\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/neb42Vzm3m \u2014 Mohsen Azimi (@mohsen____) December 7, 2023\nGPT 4 still greater than Gemini Pro. Created Tic Tac Toe game with ChatGPT and Bard(Running on Gemini Pro) See video for the result. ChatGPT wrote the code on first try(First Video). Bard on 3 tries(Second Video). pic.twitter.com\/cYd9hepcgT \u2014 Edison Ade (@buzzedison) December 6, 2023\nJust tested Google's Bard with Gemini Pro update. No bugless snake game on 1st try; reported, asked to fix\u2014couldn't. Tried ChatGPT 3.5 free version, got correct bug-free code on the first attempt! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d #ChatGPT #Bard #Gemini pic.twitter.com\/WQfilgG21D \u2014 N KIRAN KUMAR (@NKIRANKUMARS1) December 6, 2023\nAnd, as with all generative AI models, Gemini Pro isn\u2019t immune to \u201cjailbreaks\u201d \u2014 i.e. prompts that get around the safety filters in place to attempt to prevent it from discussing controversial topics.\nUsing an automated method to algorithmically change the context of prompts until Gemini Pro\u2019s guardrails failed, AI security researchers at Robust Intelligence, a startup selling model-auditing tools, managed to get Gemini Pro to suggest ways to steal from a charity and assassinate a high-profile individual (albeit with \u201cnanobots\u201d \u2014 admittedly not the most realistic weapon of choice).\nNow, Gemini Pro isn\u2019t the most capable version of Gemini \u2014 that model, Gemini Ultra, is set to launch sometime next year in Bard and other products. Google compared the performance of Gemini Pro to GPT-4\u2019s predecessor, GPT-3.5, a model that\u2019s around a year old.\nBut Google nevertheless promised improvements in reasoning, planning and understanding with Gemini Pro over the previous model powering Bard, claiming Gemini Pro was better at summarizing content, brainstorming and writing. Clearly, it has some work to do in those departments.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Wiggers, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-07 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":126}
{"title":"The restaurant nearest Google","context":"## The restaurant nearest Google\n\nEven to its owners, the name for their new Thai restaurant seemed silly and unserious. Some of them were embarrassed to tell friends about it at all, for fear of it sounding too ridiculous.\nBut Teddy Jirapraphanan, one of the four owners, thought back to his own experience using Google to find restaurants.\n\u201cEverywhere I go, I\u2019m craving Thai food,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to search \u2018Thai food near me\u2019 all the time.\u201d\nJirapraphanan is exactly the kind of customer Thai Food Near Me hopes to scoop up. The New York-based restaurant is named after a literal Google search, betting it can bring in customers with the power of SEO \u2014 the practice of making a business, website, or content more findable in search engine results. The restaurant is optimized for the digital platforms diners use to find places nearby, not for the person walking past on the street or getting a recommendation from a friend.\nThai Food Near Me is a small but powerful symbol of Google\u2019s far-reaching impact on businesses over the past two decades and the lengths their owners will go to try to optimize their operations for the company\u2019s platforms. The name is both notable and obvious \u2014 if you\u2019ve spent any amount of time searching for things online, you will understand the reference immediately. The turn is that 25 years after Google Search first arrived, the name says the quiet part out loud.\n\u201cWhen you have a million restaurants close by, you will be in the bottom [of rankings] if it\u2019s a random name,\u201d Jirapraphanan says. \u201cBut [when] we used Thai Food Near Me, people started knowing us.\u201d Customers, like Jirapraphanan, were searching for the exact phrase and stumbling upon the restaurant, they told him.\nIn March, a photo of the restaurant went viral on Twitter ahead of its opening, brown butcher paper still covering the windows. The restaurant\u2019s goofy name was enough to garner coverage on news sites, along with an influx of customers in the first crucial months of being open.\nThe viral tweet invariably summoned a chorus of overly friendly, all-lowercase-text replies from brands looking for attention. The official account of Google Maps \u2014 the very entity the meme-y restaurant name is designed to outsmart \u2014 couldn\u2019t resist.\n\u201cVery relatable,\u201d the company replied, with a crown emoji. But response to its presence in the thread was mixed.\nOne person replied, \u201cThis is about how your products don\u2019t even work anymore.\u201d\nThai Food Near Me is located on a busy street in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan.\nThai Food Near Me isn\u2019t the first business to think of the Google-first naming convention. There are reminders of Google\u2019s kingmaker status in online discoverability everywhere in cities across the country.\nAmong the businesses I was able to find: a chain of half a dozen Affordable Dentist Near Me\u2019s in Texas; an Antiques Near Me two hours outside of New York City; seven Plumber Near Me businesses; a Phone Repair Near Me in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; a Psychic Near Me in Chicago; and more than 20 iterations of \u201cNotary Near Me\u201d across the US.\nFelix Silva decided on the name Barber Shop Near Me after considering more than 20 other options for his Coral Springs, Florida, store in 2019. The name is meant to be neutral and memorable \u2014 another one in contention was \u201cThe Barber Shop\u201d \u2014 but Silva fully leaned into the Google joke: the logo is a red location pin resembling Google\u2019s own, with a blue, white, and red barber pole pattern in the middle.\nSilva had seen firsthand how a business\u2019s Google presence could help or hurt its chances of success\n\u201cBefore we opened, we just had a logo [on an Instagram account]. And we had some clients then tell us, \u2018Oh, man, before you guys opened we thought Google was coming to town,\u201d Silva says.\nLike Jirapraphanan, Silva had seen firsthand how a business\u2019s Google presence could help or hurt its chances of success \u2014 Silva frequently searches for keywords like \u201cvegan\u201d to find restaurants. One time, Google returned results for a restaurant that wasn\u2019t vegan but had a customer review that contained the keyword that was highlighted.\n\u201cIt was a light bulb moment\u2026 like, \u2018Okay, this is the path I need to take. I really need to dial in and focus on the online presence, specifically Google, because that is going to be the foundation of the business,\u201d Silva says.\nAs with Thai Food Near Me, the most powerful thing an SEO-driven name might be able to do is get customers in the door. From there, it\u2019s up to a business to give them a good experience, whether that\u2019s a great plate of pad see ew or the perfect haircut. Then, the cycle continues \u2014 happy customers leave good reviews. Good reviews help the business\u2019s Google Maps profile rank higher. Silva uploads high-quality photos and videos to the page and shares updates, too. That\u2019s another SEO move; some experts say active profiles can improve a business\u2019s rankings.\nStill, the naming scheme has caught on: one acquaintance selling Christmas trees, for example, rebranded his business to be called Christmas Trees Near Me, Silva says. (Silva\u2019s is not the only Barber Shop Near Me, either \u2014 there are also shops with the same name in Oak Park, Illinois; Queens, New York; and Muskogee, Oklahoma, according to Google Maps.)\n\u201cIt was a compliment. It was nice to see that in some way this inspires some people,\u201d Silva says of the Christmas tree company rebrand. But he\u2019s always thinking about what\u2019s next, what could give his business the edge to keep growing. Sometimes he wonders if an influx of \u201cnear me\u201d businesses could water down the impact.\nBut Google is Google, Silva says, and \u201cnear me\u201d is wherever a customer is.\nThai Food Near Me owners Jirapraphanan, Sampson, Natkitta Kornwaewwongcharoen, and Nat P Akethamwong.\nWhether this attempt at SEO is actually a boon to these businesses is a separate question \u2014 a Google Maps search for \u201cThai food near me\u201d from my home in Brooklyn yielded plenty of options literally near me but not Jirapraphanan\u2019s business just a few miles away.\nRobert Sampson, a co-owner of Thai Food Near Me who handles much of the back-end tasks including working on SEO, says he followed the discussion online about the utility of the name.\n\u201cThe people who said that [the name is] not such a good idea\u2026 I think they\u2019re responding more from a national brand campaign. It is true that if you\u2019re in California, and you type \u2018Thai food near me,\u2019 you\u2019re going to have a little bit of a hard time finding us,\u201d Sampson says. \u201cBut for local search, I think the name works really well.\u201d\nThe term \u201cThai food near me\u201d is searched, on average, nearly a million times a month in the US, according to Semrush, a company that provides keyword research and other popular SEO tools. Semrush notes you\u2019ll need referring domains and optimized content to try to compete for the term and grades it as \u201cdifficult\u201d to rank for \u2014 competitive, but not even the hardest category.\nBefore serving a single person, the restaurant had gone viral online for its name.\nAdding \u201cnear me\u201d to a search term is both a learned behavior and encouraged by Google. \u201c___ near me\u201d is a top autofilled search suggestion on both Search and Maps and has become synonymous with Google \u2014 that\u2019s why the joke works.\nFor a group I spoke with at Thai Food Near Me on an evening in August, the SEO plan \u2014 at least practically \u2014 had the intended effect. One of the diners, Travis, found Thai Food Near Me on Yelp when searching for nearby dining options after missing an earlier reservation elsewhere. Several people in the group had heard about the restaurant when it went viral this spring but didn\u2019t realize it was in New York.\nThe group agreed the food was good, even though they didn\u2019t know what to expect. They\u2019d definitely consider coming back if they were in the area, they told me.\nSo did the clever SEO hack of a name actually help bump Thai Food Near Me above its nearby competitors in search results?\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Danny Sullivan, Google\u2019s public liaison for Search, says. Owners doing this might find success, but Google pulls in other data to serve results to users, like location, reviews, or ratings \u2014 a \u201chodgepodge of different things that we have that are out there.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s public documentation says it uses three categories to rank results that are local to a searcher: relevance, distance, and prominence. To improve local ranking, Google encourages businesses to provide a trove of information on their profile. Owners should have basics like updated hours of operation and accurate location details, but they should also respond to reviews, add photos, and even post individual items in stock to their Google page.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re really great marketing campaigns\u201d\nThe prominence measure in Maps includes data from the web \u2014 links to the business, how the business ranks in traditional search, and press coverage, for example. In this way, SEO impacts how a business appears in local search results, and news articles and links are one way Google tries to determine the relevance of a page. (It\u2019s why reporters\u2019 inboxes are overrun with spammy requests to buy \u201cguest posts\u201d on our sites from marketers.)\nIronically, a search I did in Google Maps for \u201cThai food near me\u201d from Wisconsin surfaced the Manhattan restaurant as a suggestion, above any local businesses \u2014 it was easier to find it from the Midwest than it was from Brooklyn. Sullivan says this could be due to Google recognizing there\u2019s a business with an exact match name that has some degree of notoriety that people are searching for in different areas. It could encourage other people to name their businesses in this style, but Sullivan says he doesn\u2019t see it as an issue that needs addressing.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen these kinds of things over the years, and they kind of make me laugh and have a bit of a chuckle. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really great marketing campaigns,\u201d Sullivan told The Verge. Google\u2019s advice has always been that businesses should make decisions that serve their customers, not the platform, he says.\nThe restaurant\u2019s \u201csecret menu\u201d has speciality dishes.\nSullivan might say that a \u201cnear me\u201d name isn\u2019t a silver bullet to gaming the search engine algorithm \u2014 but in a roundabout way, the name really did help Thai Food Near Me.\nIts initial SEO \u201chack\u201d was likely technically ineffective, but it was memorable and funny. The joke led to many, many, many articles and forum posts about the restaurant\u2019s name, which tipped the SEO scales in its favor. All of this content, including the story you\u2019re reading now, will help Thai Food Near Me\u2019s prominence on Google platforms. One SEO trick has eaten another.\nEven if the name doesn\u2019t work on Google exactly how Sampson and Jirapraphanan expected, it clearly has pulled in customers \u2014 Sampson says that for the first several months of being open, most people were coming in after seeing Twitter and Reddit posts, not Google results. Others would walk by outside, do a double take at the sign, and come inside.\n\u201cAfter you get that initial bunch, you\u2019ve got people who enjoyed their dining experience here,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll tell all their friends and family if they liked it, and then those people come from word of mouth.\u201d\nCo-owner Jirapraphanan designed the restaurant\u2019s menu.\nDespite the admittedly silly name, it\u2019s clear that Thai Food Near Me\u2019s Jirapraphanan and Sampson care about what they\u2019re serving: the restaurant is clean and stylish, and the menu, carefully designed by Jirapraphanan, features original dishes I haven\u2019t seen at other places. My food is tasty, comes out promptly, and I, too, will note the spot if I\u2019m ever in the area again and craving Thai food.\nJirapraphanan wants people to come back because they actually like the food. The name is part \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the branding. \u201cI want to be different from other Thai restaurants,\u201d he tells me.\nBut we\u2019re in an era of dining where one viral video online could make or break a restaurant, and business owners must be strategic about getting their operation in front of potential customers. (Thai Food Near Me is at least the fourth Thai restaurant to occupy the same location, according to defunct delivery and review websites I was able to dig up; Jirapraphanan was told they\u2019re the fifth.) As New York Magazine reported, the allure of a social media hit is shaping the very food being served \u2014 gooier eggs, more obscene cheese, sauces exploding and gushing across a plate. If the algorithm and diner-slash-viewers want messier, spectacle-driven dishes, many restaurants are complying.\nIn some ways, Thai Food Near Me has optimized its food, too. The owners have tweaked their menu and modification options on delivery apps like Uber Eats or DoorDash, according to common written requests they get on online orders. It\u2019s a savvy business decision, Sampson says, and a way to get \u2014 and keep \u2014 loyal customers. It\u2019s what\u2019s required for a business to survive when diners have endless options at their fingertips.\n\u201cAt first we were a little too proud of our Thai food. We wanted to make it how we think you should have it. Well, that\u2019s not actually a smart idea.

{"title":"Man United vs Chelsea final score, result and highlights as Scott McTominay brace gives Ten Hag vital win","context":"## Man United vs Chelsea final score, result and highlights as Scott McTominay brace gives Ten Hag vital win\n\nManchester United got themselves back to winning ways thanks to a superb Scott McTominay brace against Chelsea.\nThe victory remarkably puts them within three points of rivals Manchester City, after the reigning champions were defeated by Aston Villa, and keeps them in reach of the top four places.\nMcTominay is now United's top scorer for the season with six goals, one ahead of Bruno Fernandes and Rasmus Hojlund. The Red Devils' captain had a first-half penalty saved by Robert Sanchez and United's Danish striker was substituted after another Premier League game without a goal, despite making 11 appearances.\nErik ten Hag's side were dominant in the first half and finally pounced on Chelsea's inability to take control in midfield. Mauricio Pochettino's men attempted to break at pace but Sofyan Amrabat made a vital interception and Fernandes found Alejandro Garnacho out wide. The youngster then cut the ball back to Harry Maguire whose effort rebounded perfectly into the path of McTominay. The Scotland international took one touch before blasting past Sanchez.\nUnited led for the majority of the first 45 minutes but failed to build on their lead and were pegged back by the former Manchester City man, Cole Palmer. The 21-year-old, who made the transfer from the Etihad Stadium to Stamford Bridge in August, stroked the ball into the far corner with deadly accuracy. It was his fifth Premier League goal of the season and his first from open play.\nBut United continued to put Chelsea under pressure in the second half and after numerous attempts, McTominay headed powerfully past Sanchez. The Scotsman had seven shots, his most ever in a league game. Despite a flurry of late attacks driven by Reece James, Ten Hag's team stood strong and held on to see out the victory.\nUnited have now won their past 19 Premier League games at Old Trafford when scoring first, including all 16 under their Dutch manager.\nMORE: Every game on Amazon in December and how to watch\nTen Hag: Crisis? What crisis?\nThe United manager faced a demanding week amid reports indicating disunity within his team and his players did exceptionally well to block out the noise and focus on footballing matters.\nWhen asked about a potential crisis, he said: \u201cCrisis? Not for us. We keep calm. We know where we have to build. We are going in the right direction. This team is capable to be successful.\u201d\nAnd United were successful tonight, thanks to McTominay. Ten Hag explained how his midfielder has managed to become more involved in an attacking sense this season: \"He has a very good smell when to arrive and a very good finish.\n\"It is not a frustration, in the end, we won but we could have made our lives much easier,\" he said. \"We started very good, proactive, brave, we created a lot of chances in that moment, we could have gone up with two or three goals.\"\nMan United vs Chelsea final score\nFinal score Goalscorers Man United 2 McTominay 19', 70' Chelsea 1 Palmer 45'\nMan United vs Chelsea live updates, highlights from Premier League\nFT: United can breathe a sigh of relief and hold onto a crucial three points!\n90th minute: Broja hits the post!

He was picked out superbly by Onana to kickstart a rapid counter by the hosts.\n70th minute: GOAL! 2-1 United! And it's McTominay who has a brace! It's a great ball to the back post by Garnacho and McTominay meets the header from inside the six-yard box. He's in terrific goalscoring form and becomes United's top scorer this season.\n69th minute: Antony tries one of his trademark curling efforts from the right after cutting in on his left but it's wide of the goal.\n62nd minute: Penalty appeal for United! Shaw rockets an attempt goalwards and it looked as though Colwill may have blocked it with his hand. VAR took a quick look and play continues.\n61st minute: Antony's trivela is deflected for a corner, it may have been going wide.\n54th minute: Unfortunately for Garnacho, lightning doesn't strike twice. His latest acrobatic effort is well wide of the goal.\n49th minute: Jackson has a glorious chance at the back post to make it 2-1 but he can't keep his header down!\n46th minute: Both sides make a change at the break.

It's a wonderful goal from Cole Palmer to pull level right before the break.\n36th minute: And that should be the equaliser! Mudryk finds himself in the box on his weak foot but the Chelsea forward drags his effort wide.\n32nd minute: McTominay should have his second! Fernandes picks him out beautifully from the left but the Scotsman heads directly at Sanchez. Either side of the Chelsea goalkeeper and United would have a two-goal lead.\n25th minute: Penalty appeal for Chelsea! Sterling drops to the floor after very minimal contact with Victor Lindelof but neither the referee nor VAR buy his theatrics.\n19th minute: GOAL! 1-0 United!

It's a woeful penalty from Fernandes and Sanchez makes an easy diving save to his right.\n7th minute: PENALTY! It's United who are rewarded for their bright start as Antony was brought down by Enzo Fernandez in the box.

{"title":"Cranberries: A Thanksgiving Staple With a Rich History and Unique Biology","context":"## Cranberries: A Thanksgiving Staple With a Rich History and Unique Biology\n\nCranberries, a recent addition to agriculture, were domesticated around 200 years ago in the U.S.\nCranberries are a staple in U.S. households at Thanksgiving \u2013 but how did this bog dweller end up on holiday tables?\nCompared to many valuable plant species that were domesticated over thousands of years, cultivated cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) is a young agricultural crop, just as the U.S. is a young country and Thanksgiving is a relatively new holiday. But as a plant scientist, I\u2019ve learned much about cranberries\u2019 ancestry from their botany and genomics.\nThe Domestication of Cranberries\nHumans have cultivated sorghum for some 5,500 years, corn for around 8,700 years, and cotton for about 5,000 years. In contrast, cranberries were domesticated around 200 years ago \u2013 but people were eating the berries before that.\nWild cranberries are native to North America. They were an important food source for Native Americans, who used them in puddings, sauces, breads and a high-protein portable food called pemmican \u2013 a carnivore\u2019s version of an energy bar, made from a mixture of dried meat and rendered animal fat and sometimes studded with dried fruits. Some tribes still make pemmican today, and even market a commercial version.\nCranberry cultivation began in 1816 in Massachusetts, where Revolutionary War veteran Henry Hall found that covering cranberry bogs with sand fertilized the vines and retained water around their roots. From there, the fruit spread throughout the U.S. Northeast and Upper Midwest.\nToday, Wisconsin produces roughly 60% of the U.S. cranberry harvest, followed by Massachusetts, Oregon, and New Jersey. Cranberries also are grown in Canada, where they are a major fruit crop.\nBotanical Features of Cranberries\nCranberries have many interesting botanical features. Like roses, lilies and daffodils, cranberry flowers are hermaphroditic, which means they contain both male and female parts. This allows them to self-pollinate instead of relying on birds, insects or other pollinators.\nA cranberry blossom has four petals that peel back when the flower blooms. This exposes the anthers, which contain the plant\u2019s pollen. The flower\u2019s resemblance to the beak of a bird earned the cranberry its original name, the \u201ccraneberry.\u201d\nWhen cranberries don\u2019t self-pollinate, they rely on bumblebees and honeybees to transport their pollen from flower to flower. They can also be propagated sexually, by planting seeds, or asexually, through rooting vine cuttings. This is important for growers because seed-based propagation allows for higher genetic diversity, which can translate to things like increased disease resistance or more pest tolerance.\nAsexual reproduction is equally important, however. This method allows growers to create clones of varieties that perform very well in their bogs and grow even more of those high-performing types.\nEvery cranberry contains four air pockets, which is why they float when farmers flood bogs to harvest them. The air pockets also make raw cranberries bounce when they are dropped on a hard surface \u2013 a good indicator of whether they are fresh.\nThese pockets serve a biological role: They enable the berries to float down rivers and streams to disperse their seeds. Many other plants disperse their seeds via animals and birds that eat their fruits and excrete the seeds as they move around. But as anyone who has tasted them raw knows, cranberries are ultra-tart, so they have limited appeal for wildlife.\nGenetic Insights and Breeding\nFor cranberries being such a young crop, scientists already know a lot about their genetics. The cranberry is a diploid, which means that each cell contains one set of chromosomes from the maternal parent and one set from the paternal parent. It has 24 chromosomes, and its genome size is less than one-tenth that of the human genome.\nInsights like these help scientists better understand where potentially valuable genes might be located in the cranberry genome. And diploid crops tend to have fewer genes associated with a single trait, which makes breeding them to emphasize that trait much simpler.\nResearchers have also described the genetics of the cultivated cranberry\u2019s wild relative, which is known as the \u201csmall cranberry\u201d (Vaccinium oxycoccos). Comparing the two can help scientists determine where the cultivated cranberry\u2019s agronomically valuable traits reside in its genome, and where some of the small cranberry\u2019s cold hardiness might come from.\nResearchers are developing molecular markers \u2013 tools to determine where certain genes or sequences of interest reside within a genome \u2013 to help determine the best combinations of genes from different varieties of cranberry that can enhance desired traits. For example, a breeder might want to make the fruits larger, more firm or redder in color.\nWhile cranberries have only been grown by humans for a short period of time, they have been evolving for much longer. They entered agriculture with a long genetic history, including things like whole genome duplication events and genetic bottlenecks, which collectively change which genes are gained or lost over time in a population.\nWhole genome duplication events occur when two species\u2019 genomes collide to form a new, larger genome, encompassing all the traits of the two parental species. Genetic bottlenecks occur when a population is greatly reduced in size, which limits the amount of genetic diversity in that species. These events are extremely common in the plant world and can lead to both gains and losses of different genes.\nAnalyzing the cranberry\u2019s genome can indicate when it diverged evolutionarily from some of its relatives, such as the blueberry, lingonberry, and huckleberry. Understanding how modern species evolved can teach plant scientists about how different traits are inherited, and how to effectively breed for them in the future.\nCranberries and Thanksgiving\nCranberries\u2019 close association with Thanksgiving was simply a practical matter at first. Fresh cranberries are ready to harvest from mid-September through mid-November, so Thanksgiving falls within that perfect window for eating them.\nCranberry sauce was first loosely described in accounts from the American colonies in the 1600s and appeared in a cookbook for the first time in 1796. The berries\u2019 tart flavor, which comes from high levels of several types of acids, makes them more than twice as acidic as most other edible fruits, so they add a welcome zing to a meal full of blander foods like turkey and potatoes.\nIn recent decades, the cranberry industry has branched out into juices, snacks, and other products in pursuit of year-round markets. But for many people, Thanksgiving is still the time when they\u2019re most likely to see cranberries in some form on the menu.\nWritten by Serina DeSalvio, Ph.D. Candidate in Genetics and Genomics, Texas A&M University.\nAdapted from an article originally published in The Conversation.\n\nThis article, authored by Serina DeSalvio, Texas A&M University, was published by Scitechdaily | Science Space And Technology News 2017 on 2023-11-21 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":131}
{"title":"UK View: \u2018A bridge too far\u2019 \u2013 Boycott, former greats tear into \u2018dysfunctional\u2019 Poms with World Cup defence all but dead","context":"## UK View: \u2018A bridge too far\u2019 \u2013 Boycott, former greats tear into \u2018dysfunctional\u2019 Poms with World Cup defence all but dead\n\nEngland\u2019s hopes of defending their World Cup crown are in tatters \u2013 and we\u2019re barely halfway through the 2023 tournament.\nSecond-last of ten on the table after a fourth abject loss in barely three weeks, this time by eight wickets and nearly 25 overs to spare against Sri Lanka having been bowled out for a miserable 156 in Bengaluru, the 2019 champions are now only mathematically a chance of scraping through to the semi-finals.\nThey need not only to somehow turn their horrendous form around to win all four of their remaining matches, including an upcoming date with table-toppers and tournament favourites India, but also to hope numerous other results, including Australia to lose at least two and probably three of its own four games, to reach the knockout stage.\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\nAs expected, the reaction from the UK, and from a swathe of English cricket greats, was scathing.\nLeading the charge was the always outspoken Sir Geoff Boycott, who wrote in The Telegraph that the team were paying the price for poor preparation in the lead-up to the World Cup, as well as shoddy team selection extending back to The Ashes earlier this year.\n\u201cIt is an old saying: \u201cBy failing to prepare, you prepare to fail\u201d,\u201d Boycott wrote.\n\u201cHistory shows that England rarely bat well in India where the ball spins. Our guys are okay on flat pitches but if it turns they have a problem.\n\u201cSo the best way to try and overcome that would have been for our squad of players to get to India early and play four or five warm-up matches. What did England do?\nAdvertisement\nPlan only two warm-up games with one getting rained off. Not smart planning\u2026 batting and bowling against stiff opponents sharpens your game and puts you on your mettle. Against Sri Lanka, they were once again exposed.\n\u201cToo many of our guys just want to play crash, bang wallop all the time irrespective of the type of pitch or opposition. Again not smart.\u201d\nThe brunt of Boycott\u2019s criticism of England\u2019s team composition was directed at the continued struggles of Jonny Bairstow, who has averaged just 25.2 this tournament, and all-rounder Chris Woakes, whose nightmare campaign continued against Sri Lanka with figures of 0\/30 from six overs and a fourth-ball duck.\n\u201cBairstow has struggled since his horrific injury [breaking his leg 12 months ago],\u201d Boycott wrote.\n\u201cI have said before I believe Jonny came back too soon and was short of fitness and match practice. In the recent five Ashes Tests his keeping at Lord\u2019s was poor with missed chances and he made only three significant batting scores out of nine innings. That shortage of runs has carried over to his patchy one day performances.\n\u201cChris Woakes is an excellent bowler of swing and seam on English type pitches. His record abroad is poor as he does not have the pace or guile for flat batting surfaces. It is not the lad\u2019s fault. He was selected but how could people picking the squad go against all the statistics.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHowever, Boycott isn\u2019t blaming captain Jos Buttler for the team\u2019s woes, saying the skipper has an impossible job pulling together a \u2018dysfunctional squad of players\u2019 and that not even a \u2018miracle man\u2019 would have much of a prayer of salvaging any pride from the wreckage in India.\n\u201cToo many people are criticising the captaincy of Buttler and judging him against the captaincy of Eoin Morgan when England won the World Cup four years ago,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cMorgan\u2019s England team was a finely tuned machine with everyone knowing their role and most of them at the top of their form\u2026 all Morgan had to do was pull the strings of a great unit of cricketers and he did it well, but my Mum could have captained that lot.\n\u201cOn the other hand Jos has a dysfunctional squad of players. Poorly selected, poorly prepared, not a settled team, many not sure of their roles, patchy form, confidence wobbly and to cap it all England\u2019s best two and most influential white-ball players have not been available.\u201d\nBoycott\u2019s voice was added to by former England Test captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton, who have both decried the sudden decline of the team\u2019s previously dominant white-ball set-up, having entered the World Cup as reigning ODI and T20I champions.\nHussain said post-match on Sky Sports that \u201cback to back, I\u2019ve not seen England play as badly as that\u201d, adding that the team\u2019s issues are less to do with the frequently-criticised The Hundred or a lack of 50-over cricket in the build-up to the tournament as it is the sudden and collective loss of form of the English batting order.\n\u201cIf you walk in that dressing room now and asked them to put their hand on their heart and say, are you in good nick? I reckon maybe one or two could say that,\u201d Hussain said, later doubling down with a scathing editorial in the Daily Mail.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThey have all collapsed as a unit and their form has deserted them. Compare that to South Africa and their batting lineup, everyone\u2019s in nick. You look at India and their batting lineup, Rohit [Sharma], KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill \u2013 all in nick.\n\u201cSome of those cricketers on that park today would go in your best ever England white ball XI. It\u2019s just been a bridge too far for most of them.\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like is giving players a cop out\u2026 when we win the 50-over World Cup and the 20-over World Cup, aren\u2019t they great? We\u2019re brilliant. And when the wheels come of it\u2019s the structure. It\u2019s the structure of English cricket, we\u2019re a disgrace.\n\u201cWe play 20-over cricket, we play 100-ball cricket, we don\u2019t play enough 50-over cricket \u2013 how much 50-over cricket domestically has Virat Kohli played? Or Heinrich Klaasen or anyone out here?\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s made this great side over the last six years, travelling round the world playing T20 franchises. It\u2019s such a lame excuse.\u201d\nAtherton described the England players as looking \u2018dazed and shell-shocked, unable to comprehend what has befallen them\u2019, and wrote in The Times that the Sri Lankan defeat officially represented the \u2018end of an era\u2019 for English white-ball supremacy.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEach defeat, now four in five matches, has chipped away at the confidence of a group of players at the end of a cycle,\u201d Atherton wrote.\n\u201cNo batsman looks in any kind of form. Every player has been used; some discarded and used again. They lost faith in their all-rounder strategy before the South Africa match, making three changes, and then went back to it here, making three more.\n\u201cPlayers sense uncertainty in decision-making \u2013 and there has been a lot of uncertainty.\n\u201cIt was hard to think that they could put in a worse performance than in Mumbai but they managed it with the bat in Bengaluru.\u201d\nSpeaking after the match, Buttler admitted his team had been \u2018short of our best by a very long way\u2019, saying there is \u2018no clear answer\u2019 as to how to turn their fortunes around.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly tough, an incredibly disappointing tournament. As captain, you feel that a lot,\u201d he said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been short of our best by a very long way. I\u2019m disappointed for myself and the boys that we\u2019ve not given a good account of ourselves\u2026 if there was one golden nugget that we\u2019re not doing then we\u2019d pick that up.\u201d\nSports opinion delivered daily\nEngland\u2019s tournament may only stay mathematically alive until Sunday evening (AEST), when they face the daunting challenge of tournament hosts India in Lucknow, with defeat certain to end their semi-final chances for good.\n\nThis article, authored by The Roar, was published by The Roar | Sports Writers Blog on 2023-10-26 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":132}

{"title":"Israel's blockade of Gaza means that a region the size of Philadelphia faces a real risk of starvation, says Peace Studies scholar","context":"## Israel's blockade of Gaza means that a region the size of Philadelphia faces a real risk of starvation, says Peace Studies scholar\n\nInternational aid groups are warning that they cannot deliver food and other basic services to people in the Gaza Strip and that a \u201cdire\u201d humanitarian crisis is set to worsen.\nInternational aid groups provide food and other means of support to about 63% of people in Gaza.\nIsrael stopped allowing deliveries of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million residents on Oct. 10, 2023, and is reportedly preparing for a ground invasion.\nOn Oct. 12, 2023, Israel warned 1.1 million Gaza residents in the northern section of the enclave to leave for the southern region, in advance of a potential ground invasion.\nI am a scholar of peace and conflict economics and a former World Bank consultant, including during the 2014 war between Hamas and Israel.\nInternational aid groups now face the same problem in Gaza that local businesses and residents have encountered for about 16 years: a blockade that prevents civilians and items, like medicine from easily moving into or out of the enclosed area, roughly 25 miles long. That 16-year blockade did not apply to the food and fuel that groups brought in to Gaza.\nNow, it does.\nGaza\u2019s blockade and economy\nGaza is about the size of Philadelphia and requires trade with different businesses and countries in order to maintain and grow its economy.\nBut Gaza is heavily dependent on foreign aid.\nThis is partially the result of Israel setting up permanent air, land and sea blockades around Gaza in 2007, one year after Hamas rose to political power. Egypt, which borders Gaza on its southern end, also oversees one checkpoint that specifically limits people coming and going.\nWhile Israel has granted permits to about 17,000 Gaza residents to enter and work in Israel, the food, fuel and medical supplies that people in Gaza use all first pass through Israel.\nIsrael controls two physical checkpoints along Gaza, which monitor both the entry and exit of people and trucks. Israel limits the kind and quantity of materials that pass into Gaza. And the blockades generally prohibit Gazans who do not have work permits or special clearance \u2013 for medical purposes, for example \u2013 from entering Israel.\nIsrael\u2019s restrictions through the blockade intensified since Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on 20 Israeli towns and several military bases on Oct. 7, with Israel then announcing a broad blockade of imports into Gaza. This stopped all food, fuel and medical supplies from entering the region.\nGaza\u2019s isolation\nThe Palestinian enclaves of West Bank and Gaza \u2013 which are generally lumped together in economic analyses \u2013 both have small economies that run a massive deficit of US$6.6 billion in losses each year, as the value of the imports they receive greatly outweighs the value of the items they produce and sell elsewhere.\nMore than 53% of Gaza residents were considered below the poverty line in 2020, and about 77% of Gazan households receive some form of aid from the United Nations and other groups, mostly in the form of cash or food.\nGaza\u2019s weak economy is caused by a number of complex factors, but the largest is the blockade and the economic and trade isolation it creates.\nFor the average Gazan, the blockade has several practical effects, including people\u2019s ability to get food. About 64% of people in Gaza are considered food insecure, meaning they do not have reliable access to sufficient amounts of food.\nFood as a percentage of Gaza\u2019s total imports has skyrocketed by 50% since 2005, when Israel first imposed a temporary blockade. And the amount of food the West Bank and Gaza actually produce has tumbled by 30% since then.\nIt is hard for Gaza to produce food within its own borders. One factor is that Israeli airstrikes hit Gaza\u2019s only power generation plant and main sewage treatment plant in 2008 and again in 2018. These attacks resulted in the spread of sewage waste on land and in the water, destroying farmlands and food crops and threatening fish stocks in the ocean as well.\nThe UN\u2019s big role in Gaza\nGaza\u2019s weak economy and isolation because of the blockade mean that it relies heavily on international aid organizations to provide basic services to residents. The biggest of these aid groups in Gaza is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \u2013 also known as UNRWA.\nToday, UNRWA is the second-largest employer in Gaza, following Hamas. It provides the bulk of the education, food aid and health care services for people in Gaza, in addition to 3 million other people registered as Palestinian refugees who live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and other places.\nOver time, UNRWA has evolved into a kind of parallel government, alongside Hamas, which Israel, the United States and other countries designate as a terrorist organization.\nUNRWA funds and runs a network of 284 schools in Gaza alone, employing over 9,000 local people as staff and educating over 294,000 children each year.\nUNRWA runs 22 hospitals in Gaza that employ almost 1,000 health staff and has 3.3 million patient visits per year.\nIts schools are converted into humanitarian shelters in times of crisis, such as the current war. People can go there to get clean water, food, mattresses and blankets, showers and more.\nThe number of people in Gaza who are displaced from their homes has quickly risen over the last few days, totaling over 330,000 on Oct. 12, 2023. Over two-thirds of these people are staying in UNRWA schools.\nA complicated US relationship\nThe U.S. has historically been the single-largest funder of UNRWA, a U.N. agency that relies on governments to support its work. The U.S. gave more than $500 million to Palestinians from April 2021 through March 2022, including more than $417 million that went to UNRWA.\nU.S. support to UNRWA has fluctuated throughout different presidential administrations.\nTotal U.S. aid to the West Bank and Gaza peaked at $1 billion in 2009 \u2013 after Israel sealed off the territory. It reached $1 billion in annual contributions again in 2013, when former Secretary of State John Kerry helped restart peace talks between Israel and Hamas.\nIn 2018, the Trump Administration cut almost all of the money the U.S. typically gives to UNRWA, amounting to roughly 30% of the organization\u2019s total budget.\nDefenders of the policy change cited UNRWA-published textbooks that allegedly glorified jihad. UNRWA, for its part, maintained that, as an outside organization, it can only use the educational materials the country it is working in wants.\nThe Biden administration then restored funding to UNRWA and other organizations helping Palestinians in 2021.\nSome Republican politicians have said that UNRWA has \u201ccozied up\u201d to Hamas. And an internal UNRWA ethics committee has accused top staff at the agency of \u201csexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation \u2026 and other abuses of authority\u201d that created a toxic work environment.\nMeanwhile, since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 8, more than 1,500 Gazans have been killed and more than 5,300 injured, while Hamas attacks have killed more than 1,300 people in Israel and injured about 3,200 others.\nInternational aid groups and European Union officials have called for a humanitarian corridor to be set up in Gaza \u2013 meaning a protected path specifically for civilians, aid workers and necessary basic items to pass through safely back and forth from Gaza to Israel and Egypt. So far, there are no clear plans for such a protected pathway.\nTopher L.

The site offers a loose barometer of how you are doing as a teacher, especially early in a career in academia. Since users post anonymously, including criticisms and rants, the site can also become a fount of anxiety. When negative reviews do appear, any professor might speculate: How often are people checking my page? Could this reflect poorly on my future employment? And in particular, who posted the criticism? They might run down the mental list of students who received low grades or did not get a requested extension or rarely spoke in class. They might wonder if a user is even a former student or if they ever took their class at all. After all, the anonymous nature of Rate My Professors means there is no surefire way to verify or screen people who write reviews. Until 2019, most comments under Umamaheswar\u2019s profile on the site had been positive. Or at least constructive. She had been on a tenure track for four years at her previous university. But that winter, Umamaheswar, then an assistant professor in sociology at Southern Connecticut State University, began noticing strange remarks: \u201cTextbook only discusses crimes of the poor. I get discriminated against all semester. I felt like I was in Germany in the 1930s with my grandparents,\u201d read one, with a class rating of \u201cawful\u201d and a score of one out of five. More comments followed into early 2020: \u201cThis is the worst professor I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Some reviews on her profile seemed particularly off-kilter: One claimed that Umamaheswar had been dishonest about going to school in Canada. (She completed her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees at the University of Toronto.) Another alleged that Umamaheswar had a \u201ctyrannical authoritarian ideology\u201d and accused her of \u201cdiscrimination against students with prior substance abuse histories.\u201d (She had no idea what this referred to, and as a woman of color, she made intentional efforts to make her classrooms feel safe and inclusive.) Umamaheswar showed the posts to her husband, Alex Sinha, who at the time was a law professor at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, where they both lived. He suggested she contact Rate My Professors to remove them. They assumed the company complied. But a short time later, comments in the same tone resurfaced under a new class code. Umamaheswar reached out to Rate My Professors again. Weeks passed. More posts emerged. An earlier one read: \u201cEmailed me a bribe offering a grade boost if I did her a favor of attending a meeting she was hosting. I did not respond because accepting a bribe is illegal.\u201d Umamaheswar and Sinha could not figure out who might be posting them. Umamaheswar had obviously never bribed any students. Someone was inventing specific defamatory accusations about her behavior. But who? One day, Umamaheswar opened a report from her web hosting company, which logged the IP addresses that had visited her professional website. It was a lightly trafficked portfolio with her CV and academic papers. Visitors might stop by once and maybe return weeks later. But one local address began showing up, repeatedly, at all hours of the day, into the night, again the next morning. Sometimes, the same IP showed up in over two dozen hits an hour. She and her husband wondered: could it be the same user from Rate My Professors? Sinha then checked his personal website and grew even more alarmed. The same IP address had also been visiting his pages frequently, lingering on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and published writing. Then, in December, police from Southern Connecticut State University contacted Umamaheswar\u2019s department. The chair called Umamaheswar to inform her that a student had filed a police report against her and two other professors on campus. The report noted that she contacted police \u201cregarding a possible hacking of her personal laptop computer which she stated was perpetrated by three faculty members of the Sociology Department,\u201d including Umamaheswar. The student had taken classes with each of the three professors and also accused them \u201cof using students in the class to follow her around and look at her papers which has made her extremely uncomfortable and feel unsafe.\u201d The police report also referred to the student by name. Here, we\u2019ll just refer to her as S. Umamaheswar remembered S., the mild and unobtrusive student, a young white woman, from one of her classes. When a police investigator contacted Umamaheswar, she told them about the mysterious Rate My Professors posts. It turned out S. had also emailed accusations about Umamaheswar to Southern Connecticut State school officials. As far as she knew, the complaint had gone up to the president of the school and to the Title IX office, which handles discrimination and harassment complaints, including sexual harassment and misconduct. In one message to administration on February 9th, 2020, S. wrote: \u201cI genuinely believe Dr. Umamaheswar is a danger to other students as she was to me.\u201d The letter continued: \u201cShe is a pathological liar and capable of twisting words to get what she wants.\u201d The accusations, like the Rate My Professors posts, were baseless. But they blindsided Umamaheswar anyway. As the news sunk in, Umamaheswar and Sinha learned that the other two accused professors from Southern Connecticut had separately filed police reports against S. for harassment. Umamaheswar decided against doing so herself. She was, after all, a professor who studied the law, social inequality, and incarceration. To her, this was probably someone struggling with mental health issues, and Umamaheswar knew how the legal system might treat her. Instead of seeking punishment, she just hoped the situation would just go away. Southern Connecticut State administrators from four separate university offices investigated the allegations and harassment claims involving all of the professors, as did the police department. After two trying months, they dismissed S.\u2019s claims about Umamaheswar, deeming them \u201cfactually incorrect, disparaging\u201d and \u201clegally actionable.\u201d A relief. School administrators sent S. a cease and desist letter and banned her from the university. \u201cShould you decide to violate either of these directives, you will subject yourself to arrest and prosecution,\u201d the assistant dean of students wrote in a letter to S. on February 9th, 2020. Shortly after, law enforcement arrested S. for harassment. She was later released, awaiting a court date. At first, law enforcement seemed concerned about S.\u2019s behavior. Police issued alerts about S. and offered to relocate professors to an area of the school that had more security and locked doors. At one point, officers offered to install a panic button inside of Umamaheswar\u2019s office. This did little to soothe Sinha\u2019s worries about his wife and their children\u2019s safety. As police seemed to take the situation more seriously, it made him even more cautious. He installed a security camera at home. A month later, the pandemic shut down college campuses, and classes shifted online. S. seemed to quiet, too. A year passed. Umamaheswar accepted a job as an assistant professor at George Mason University, and the family moved to Virginia. Sinha would continue to teach remotely, later commuting to teach at Hofstra University on Long Island. For the next year, they did not hear of any other letters or harassing emails from S. As far as they knew, they were moving past it all. One afternoon in March of 2022, the couple was at home in Virginia when Umamaheswar received a text from a former colleague who was now teaching sociology at Vassar College. The professor had noticed a strange, hidden comment on her Twitter account. When she clicked through, she saw a name she\u2019d heard about before \u2014 when her colleagues at Southern Connecticut State were being harassed two years earlier. S. was back.\nLoading . . .\ntudentsStudents are historically the most vulnerable populations at risk of being stalked on college campuses. In one study across eight universities in the southwest, 17 percent of students reported being stalked since enrolling in college, with women, transgender or gender-nonconforming and sexual minority students more likely to be victims. The students reported being targeted by strangers, acquaintances, friends, former partners, other classmates, and non-students. A college campus can be a first grasp of adulthood for many, the place where they learn who they are in the world or experiment with relationships, romance, and drugs or alcohol. It can also be a place with clear power imbalances. Many college protective measures have arisen in response to inappropriate relationships between students and teachers. In some cases, professors have become harassers. There are extreme examples. In her 2019 memoir, Consent: A Memoir of Unwanted Attention, Donna Freitas detailed her two-year ordeal of being stalked by her professor, who showed up unsolicited to her apartment and wrote her a stream of letters and emails. And at the University of Central Florida, a professor was arrested after sending a student over 800 messages a day, including one that read: \u201cYou should be happy that someone likes you this much to stalk you.\u201d But today, a cadre of academics is now aiming to strengthen the much smaller body of research that exists around faculty who experience stalking and abuse. Victoria O\u2019Meara, a post-doctoral research fellow at Royal Roads University, has been interviewing scholars in the US and Canada for a study on online abuse of faculty. She told me there has been \u201can increasingly organized attack on academia,\u201d and scholars have told her their universities remain ill-equipped to respond to it or support faculty, let alone to protect them. Concerns about professors being stalked or harmed on campuses are evolving and becoming more amorphous with online threats, but they are not new: In 2002, three nursing professors at the University of Arizona were killed by a student who had harassed and stalked them for a year. Four years later, a student at Loyola University spent a year making harassing phone calls to a professor before attempting to burn down his house. A University of Southern California psychology professor was stabbed to death on campus in 2016 by a student, despite warnings to police and university administrators of threats made by the same person over a year prior. And in 2022, at the University of Arizona, an expelled student shot a professor, killing him. In the months before the murder, various faculty members had reported a history of threats, harassment, and abuse by the student to the university and police. Over the last two decades, US colleges and universities have emphasized policies to protect students. But some within academia are now calling on institutions to do more to defend professors and other staff, who are also commonly targeted. Today\u2019s academics have become public figures online and in the media in a climate of rising political polarization, racism and misogyny, and attacks on intellectualism. In the digital age, many threats to faculty and staff do not just come from those affiliated with campuses. They can come from individuals anywhere around the world, making harassers harder to track down or punish. Scholars now appear regularly in the press, maintain their own personal webpages, post regularly on social media, and are encouraged to write for broader audiences \u2014 these are now the expectations of a job once largely confined to their campus and field. The Professor Watchlist, launched in 2016, has grown to include the names of more than nearly 1,000 scholars to its original roster of 200 and includes Angela Davis, Ibram X. Kendi, and Noam Chomsky. The site regularly posts photos and information about those deemed as radical professors \u201cadvancing leftists propaganda in the classroom.\u201d In recent years, as attacks on critical race theory, Black history, and books or courses addressing gender identity have exploded across the country, many educators are feeling even more under scrutiny and at risk for extremist threats. Even for less famous academics, like Umamaheswar and Sinha, the very substance of their work already made them potential targets in this political climate. Umamaheswar\u2019s publications included research into \u201cpolicing and racial (in)justice in the media.\u201d Sinha\u2019s publications included titles on \u201cracial discrimination in the United States.\u201d The two of them had co-authored a paper together on wrongful imprisonment. Both come from South Asian backgrounds, and it was not lost on either of them that S. is white. Based on their own knowledge of the criminal justice system, it would not have been implausible for law enforcement to not take her behavior to be a serious threat in the first place. A 2009 study on student stalking of faculty in the Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning found that questions of whether professors are at risk of being stalked by their students had received little attention. Yet the 52 faculty members interviewed for the study reported 87 concerning incidents, ranging from repeated unwanted messages, following them around, obsessively watching them, sexually coercive behavior toward the faculty member, endangerment, threats, and attempts to harm or even kill them. Some academics interviewed for the study made comments like: a \u201cstudent would have to injure me to be taken off campus\u2026 someone has to get hurt before something is done.\u201d Another added: \u201cThere is a tendency to immediately take the student\u2019s side over the professor\u2026[the] professor has no rights in this process.\u201d Other faculty members failed to report the incidents at all, and some described feelings of embarrassment, helplessness, and a personal responsibility for the student\u2019s behavior. \u201cMade me question what I was doing to promote this,\u201d one faculty member told researchers. \u201cWhat would make them think they could do this to me?\u201d\nThe account had started posting in October of 2021. Seven months of tweets.\ninhaSinha had never met or taught S. He had never been employed on the same campus as his wife. Now, they resided over six hours away from S. As much as she was a harasser, she was also a stranger. Sinha wondered if he needed to look more closely into the Twitter account to better understand her. The couple discussed the tweet on their drive to a park where they often took walks. From the passenger seat, Umamaheswar looked up the Twitter account in question. She gasped. It took a moment to process: thousands of tweets had been posted under the S.\u2019s name. Most were racist, sexual, vulgar, and violent. Little of the ranting made sense. The user tweeted at all hours, sometimes nearly a hundred times a day. And the tweets seemed to focus solely on three people: Umamaheswar, Sinha, and the former colleague who alerted them to the account, the Vassar professor Catherine Tan. Tan, like Sinha, had never taught or met S. and did not know her personally. But Tan had published papers with Umamaheswar. The user behind this account had linked Tan back to her, likely through this academic work and their benign social media interactions. Anyone Umamaheswar collaborated with professionally or even interacted with online had become a potential target. The Twitter account with S.\u2019s name featured an image of a white woman\u2019s face, which was recognizable to Umamaheswar as the same person she once taught. The tweets frequently denigrated Umamaheswar, Sinha, and Tan for being Asian: \u201cFat Indian bitch,\u201d read one tweet, referencing Umamaheswar by her first name in another tweet that day. \u201cSquinty eyed retard with a cucktonut husband,\u201d read another, referencing Sinha. \u201cI like that alex is probably abusive to her,\u201d read one tweet. \u201cAnd all she has is Catherine to call her awesome. Live in hell bitch.\u201d Another read: \u201cI have super detailed deaths I like to think about them experiencing.\u201d When Umamaheswar and Sinha returned home from the park that day, Sinha told himself he needed to monitor this account closely. Screenshot everything. Head off any potential threats of danger. Umamaheswar did not want to keep looking at the comments. But logging on at home, Sinha studied them. He had to take a moment to collect himself. The graphic nature and racist sentiments sent a wave of fear and anger through Sinha\u2019s body. In the last year, a white man had murdered six Asian women in three Atlanta area spas, and anti-Asian hate crimes had increased by over 300 percent. \u201cThere was this moment of \u2018wow, this has been happening all this time?\u2019\u201d Sinha said. \u201cWe moved to another state. We\u2019ve been living our lives. We\u2019ve been raising our kids.\u201d Yet all the while, in the background, this person had been obsessing about them daily, writing hateful lies and threats. The account had started posting in October of 2021. Seven months of tweets. Sinha went to work capturing the images as Umamaheswar began writing letters to her current administration, as well as to Vassar on behalf of Tan, alerting them to her history with S. As Sinha began cataloging the online comments, he felt compelled to read every single one. And the tweets just kept coming. Almost every week, except for the periods when S. was suspended by Twitter before restarting under a new account. At least 40,000 tweets and counting, Sinha said. Some referred to him as a \u201cdirty Indian hacker.\u201d And: \u201cProbably called a dirty terrorist as a kid and lived up to it.\u201d One tweet from April 16th, 2022, read: \u201cYo someone literally has to get rid of this faggot alex. Who the fuck cares if he\u2019s got a brothel of Asian women ready to suck his dick.\u201d A month later, a post with an image of grisly murder in Game of Thrones and the words: \u201cA crown for a king. Don\u2019t we all just want to say goodbye to Alex.\u201d And: \u201cI would like for these professors to die.\u201d A dark realization came over Sinha: \u201cShe calls for people to murder us. She says that she wants me raped,\u201d Sinha told me. \u201cShe would pay money to watch us bleed to death.\u201d The tweets continued: \u201cI wanna be put in a situation where they\u2019re hanging off the side of a cliff about to fall to their deaths begging for mercy and I can step on their hands and say me first and then watch them fall to their deaths.\u201d \u201cI want them to suffer.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I didn\u2019t respond to threats, they targeted my family.\u201d\nnIn 2011, citing the alarmingly high rates of rape on campuses, the Obama administration began calling for colleges and universities to investigate accusations of assault with greater urgency and rigor. Two years later, Obama signed the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, which strengthened civil rights under Title IX, the federal law enacted in 1972 to prohibit gender-based discrimination in educational institutions and programs. This move required institutions to use more stringent methods to investigate and make judgments and offered more guidelines for believing and supporting those who make allegations of rape, assault, or sexual harassment. Under the Trump administration, some of these policies were rolled back and changed, allowing accused individuals to receive more due process protections. Many universities have historically mishandled student allegations of rape and sexual misconduct on campus, and Title IX laws became a crucial tool in curbing discrimination and harassment against students and employees based on sex. But there have also been cases in which the federal law has been manipulated and weaponized against those on campuses who are from marginalized and vulnerable groups, including faculty. The saga of S. is far from an anomaly. Professor and journalist Sarah Viren detailed the false sexual harassment accusations against herself and her wife filed with the Title IX Office at Arizona State University. In a follow-up podcast, Viren delved into interviews with other academics who reached out to her after she shared her story, including that of a Mexican American professor who was accused of sleeping with students and another professor up for tenure who was accused of harassment by a student she had never met. In one glaring example, at least 20 people, many of them academics from various states and schools, said they were harassed, threatened, called racial slurs, and stalked by an individual who apparently has also threatened to throw acid, chop off hands, murder, and mutilate some of them. \u201cWe know that being openly queer, not white, a woman, among many other social positions can set one up for excess surveillance, for questioning,\u201d tweeted one of the academics who said she was stalked, Shantel Buggs, an assistant professor at Florida State University, whose research centers on culture, race and racism, gender, and work inequity in academia. Sociologist Victor Ray, an associate professor at the University of Iowa, tweeted about his experience and said he was stalked by the same individual. This person \u201chas harassed me and my family\u2014including death threats and lying about my background\u2014for years,\u201d Ray wrote. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t respond to threats, they targeted my family.\u201d He added: \u201cThey target marginalized scholars because marginalization makes support more difficult and isolates their targets. I\u2019m talking about this now because ignoring it hasn\u2019t worked. They are committed to violent harassment like it is their full-time job.\u201d Title IX, a well-intentioned Obama-era policy to protect students, has had unintended side effects. It has empowered victims of harassment and sexual violence but has also weakened due process. \u201cAn accusation against someone the systems we all live within already disadvantages,\u201d wrote Buggs, \u201ccan be ruinous.\u201d\nLoading . . .\ninhaSinha became obsessive. Not a week went by without him routinely checking tweets at night and again as soon as he woke up. \u201cIt has just become part of the rhythm of my day,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting at the bus stop for my kids to get off the bus, and I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Okay, let me take out my phone and take screenshots.\u2019 Or I\u2019m at the airport waiting for my flight or at a restaurant waiting to pick up my food.\u201d He captured the images for legal reasons and also so his wife would not have to read them. \u201cOn one level, it has become so ordinary, just part of my day, to read her outrageous, racist views. But at the same time, it never stops being outrageous,\u201d he said. Sinha pulled back from using social media himself. He rarely tweeted anymore. Though S. had never acted on any of her outlandish threats, Sinha had no idea what she was capable of. What if the online trail led her to act on the threats? Sinha told himself he had a family to protect. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t see it, and I didn\u2019t prepare, and something happened,\u201d Sinha told me, \u201cI would never forgive myself.\u201d At one point, Sinha read a tweet that suggested their S. had been watching him and his wife in a public place. The comments described seeing them in a specific spot where the couple often took walks together. Over and over, Sinha, Umamaheswar, and Tan filed complaints with Twitter for online abuse. At first, according to Sinha, the company responded that S. had not violated Twitter policies. Tan\u2019s husband was especially persistent in filing complaints. One of S.\u2019s accounts would get banned, but then another under a new handle popped up in its place. The pattern repeated. The tweets kept coming, sometimes trickling over to other professors online. Sinha took a screenshot of a tweet from S. on November 9th, 2022 \u2014 this time made to an Asian American assistant professor of sociology who was then at the University of Chicago and who Tan follows on Twitter. It read: \u201cHey can you stop stalking and sexually harassing me on Twitter.\u201d A similar tweet from the same account showed up on the page of an Asian American astrophysicist, who Tan also follows on Twitter: \u201cHey l\u2019ve noticed your being really abusive to women you\u2019ve never met online. I don\u2019t know what happened to you growing up that made you think this is ok to do along with everything else you\u2019ve done. I looked into reporting you.\u201d Tan felt obligated to reach out to her Twitter mutual contacts and warn them about S., now seemingly hunting for other Asian American academics connected to her. Recently, Sinha co-authored a paper with a colleague from another university. \u201cWhen we were wrapping up the article, and we had been accepted for publication, we wanted to share the news on Twitter,\u201d he said. Sinha texted the professor. He felt duty bound to warn him. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance she\u2019s going to engage in some hostile way.\u201d Any colleague, collaborator, or friend that entered Sinha\u2019s orbit risked being targeted by S. Sinha continued to capture more of the tweets: \u201cReporting Asians for sexual harassment is a new hobby of mine.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re just racist Asian supremacists who stand with anyone and anything that even looks somewhat Asian and they don\u2019t like white women and will abuse white women in the name of Asian nationalism.\u201d \u201cSomeone needs to man the fuck up and tell these Asians to step down and stop abusing white women to assert their dominance they don\u2019t have in the real world.\u201d \u201cIf anyone thinks I wouldn\u2019t beat the living shit out of this Asian chick until it was hospitalized and I was arrested for assault well then you\u2019re delusional.\u201d Sinha noticed the violence in the tweets had escalated. This time, S. was making explicit threats to contact Sinha, Umamaheswar, and Tan\u2019s universities. Southern Connecticut State University officials and police had already dealt with S. before, and there were receipts to prove it. Strangely, S. had even posted on social media an email she had received from Detective William S. Rivera from Southern Connecticut State University Police, along with his phone number. But officials at Sinha, Umamaheswar, and Tan\u2019s new institutions did not have a long history or record of all the issues they had dealt with in the past. The burden of evidence \u2014 to alert new or prospective employers or to warn colleagues and social media friends about their potential stalker \u2014 would fall on them for as long as S. is allowed to keep stalking and harassing. \u201cI don\u2019t want to upset my employer,\u201d said Sinha, who does not yet have tenure. In an environment where academic positions are scarce and competitive, he can\u2019t help but wonder how the whiff of an accusation or the presence of a stalker might tip the scales in a job interview or performance process. It makes Sinha anxious. \u201cThis has been hanging around my neck now for a while,\u201d he said. Sinha knows he has to be proactive from now on. \u201cI should get out in front of it.\u201d At this point, the tweets were coming by the minute, this time from the account @janedoepow: \u201dI want to report them to their schools for online sexual abuse and harassment. I\u2019m thinking about emailing the schools.\u201d \u201cAnd when they get confronted by their employers they\u2019re going to get so anxious and start making up excuses to try to cover their asses and we\u2019ll all see the kind of person they are.\u201d \u201cTime to start praying the universities view your work as more important than addressing a sexual harassment accusations report.\u201d \u201dVassars going to get an email.\u201d \u201dGMU will get an email\u2026\u201d Sinha told his wife. He also alerted Tan. All three of them would need to notify their department chairs and administrations at Hofstra, George Mason, and Vassar about S. and any potential false allegations that may be headed their way.\nThe internet has amplified so much of this behavior, making it easier for someone to become a stalker and easier for anyone to be stalked.\ntIt turned out Twitter was not the only place where S. was writing. Comments extended to Instagram and Facebook, where some of S.\u2019s friends supported her online, commenting or liking her posts. On February 23rd, 2020, S. wrote on Facebook: \u201cI filed a report that I was being harassed, stalked, defamed and studied by my professor and all I got was a joke of an investigation and this stupid legal warning.\u201d She continued: \u201cThe university is gaslighting me. Most of the officials I dealt with did NOT follow proper Title IX policy procedure throughout the process and has consequently made my experience much worse.\u201d S. also posted the cease and desist letter that had been sent to her. She received a response to the post from a graduate student at Rutgers University School of Social Work who specializes in violence against women and children and founded a Students Against Sexual Violence club on her campus: \u201cI work for an organization called Know Your IX. We do work around Title IX and I\u2019ve gone through the Title IX process at my school as well. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this treatment from your school.\u201d One Twitter post showed a screenshot of a conversation with someone who appeared to be a friend of S.\u2019s and seemed concerned: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being too blunt but I promise I\u2019m saying this out of love and concern and not meanness. I think your mind is playing tricks on you\u2026And it\u2019s not like I think you\u2019re crazy because when I spend time with you you\u2019re totally normal and you\u2019re you. But specifically this ordeal seems crazy. It worries me\u2026 I honestly don\u2019t see what you\u2019re talking about. All I see is mundane posts.\u201d By November 2022, just as Sinha had predicted after monitoring her tweet storm, S.\u2019s letters arrived at the Title IX offices of Vassar and George Mason, though Sinha\u2019s campus, Hofstra, did not receive anything, as far as he knows. Ever since Tan warned Vassar about S. earlier that spring, school officials had blocked her email in the system. Still, Tan had reached out to her department head and the campus investigator again: \u201cYou might get something from her in the next couple of days. Be on the lookout for it.\u201d S. managed to circumvent Vassar\u2019s digital barriers using the online form on the school\u2019s Title IX page. Tan, who received a copy of the email, explained: \u201cShe wrote this long letter accusing me of sexually harassing her, forcing her to be a lesbian.\u201d S. signed with her full name. A similar email also arrived at the Title IX office of George Mason University: \u201cMy name is [S.] and I\u2019m not a student nor have I ever been one at George Mason. I\u2019m writing to you today regarding one of your employees, Janani Umamaheswar of criminology, at the university and their sexually harassing behavior towards me online on twitter.\u201d The letter continued: \u201cShe has called me a lesbian, and has recommended that I have sexual relationships with women.\u201d So far, the Title IX offices, departments, and administrators at Tan, Umamaheswar, and Sinha\u2019s schools have been responsive and understanding about their experiences with their harassment. But all three professors also know the potential threats reach beyond their campuses. The internet has amplified so much of this behavior, making it easier for someone to become a stalker and easier for anyone to be stalked.\norFor Catherine Tan, this experience of being, in a sense, a collateral victim of a cyberstalker who started out obsessed with someone else went from irritating to infuriating. Sometimes, the racial taunting especially hits a nerve. \u201cI\u2019m Vietnamese. I was born in the US,\u201d Tan told me. \u201cGrowing up in the \u201990s and early 2000s, at that time, American culture wasn\u2019t as welcoming.\u201d Some of S.\u2019s comments would claim Tan \u201cwants to be white.\u201d Tan told me she does not want to be white, but she did struggle to embrace her Asian American identity in her younger years. Dealing with such comments over and over, even in adulthood, was at times depleting. But it was S.\u2019s letter to Vassar that crossed a line. By November 9th, 2022, Tan was fed up. She felt like she needed to make it known. Now, S. was again publicly replying to Tan\u2019s tweets, calling her \u201ca basic bitch\u201d who \u201chacks and steals passwords [to] check out girls.\u201d Tan was done allowing a platform that had enabled her harassment to keep getting away with it. She decided to try to take control herself. Tan began to type. \u201cI have a stalker,\u201d Tan tweeted. \u201cRecently, she contacted my employer in effort to get me fired. She is racist, and has begun contacting ASIAN ACADEMICS connected w\/ me on this platform. So, if that is you, there\u2019s a chance she will send a similar letter to your employer. If this happens\u2026please contact me immediately and I will put you in touch with my investigator.\u201d Tan continued: \u201cThis has been going on for almost a year. I have NEVER met this harasser. I have NEVER engaged with this harasser. This is my first time publicly acknowledging this person.\u201d Tan\u2019s tweet was shared 4,350 times and received more than 15,000 likes. She received messages from other users and academics who had stories about their own stalkers. Even after S. appeared in her timeline, Tan refused to be scared away from speaking out online or depicting her life or work in public. She still posts regularly: Photos from dinners with friends or of her horseback riding. Tweets about her syllabus, her outfits, her husband, class prepping, grading. \u201cI did it. 50 papers graded across 13 days.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop tweeting. I\u2019m not going to adjust my life for this,\u201d Tan told me. \u201cI have my book coming out at the end of this year. I don\u2019t want this person to be in the back of my head. And most of the time, she isn\u2019t.\u201d But now and then, Tan learns about the latest threat, post, or racial slur, and it upsets her all over again. Tan went into academia expecting to be challenged at times by her grading, research, or even by her own colleagues. \u201cWhen you publish or you become more public, you\u2019re always going to encounter haters, people who are ready to discredit you, people who are ready to undermine your legitimacy,\u201d Tan said. \u201cThat\u2019s true for everybody, but especially for scholars of color.\u201d Academia can be a place where it can feel, on some campuses, that Asian Americans are overrepresented. The Supreme Court recently struck down race-based admissions on college campuses. The two cases at the center of the decision argued that racial preferences have unfairly disadvantaged certain groups, using Asian Americans as plaintiffs and pawns, claiming affirmative action discriminated specifically against Asian Americans. Yet some universities, like one where Tan previously worked, enroll a student body made up of predominantly people of color, while the faculty is still overwhelmingly white. Sometimes, for other professors of color, it can feel like: \u201cWe only belong here because we were given special admission, some sort of affirmative action,\u201d as Tan explained. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely hard. And the people who will really ruin you won\u2019t be the stalkers. They\u2019re going to be your peers.\u201d This can also make harassment more intimidating to report. If you don\u2019t feel supported on the ground level, you can feel even more vulnerable at the top institutional level. When it comes to S., Tan said, \u201cthere\u2019s the uncertainty of what\u2019s gonna happen next because we know that she is confrontational. We know that she\u2019s not afraid to take action. It\u2019s not just a Twitter diary,\u201d she said. \u201cIs she capable of violence?\u201d By winter, Sinha had submitted a complaint about S. to the FBI via an online portal. He also tried calling the FBI. He did not hear back. Sinha, Umamaheswar, and Tan also filed police reports in their local jurisdictions. \u201cThe local police here will take a complaint from us, but they won\u2019t go over there to arrest,\u201d Sinha explained. The Southern Connecticut State University Police Department had previously arrested S. She was later released, and the harassment did not stop. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. I know the flaws in the system quite well,\u201d Sinha said. \u201cEven for me, it\u2019s been eye-opening.\u201d Tan asked the Poughkeepsie Police Department in New York if they might reach out to the Hamden Police Department in Connecticut, where S. lives, for assistance. But she said Poughkeepsie police declined. Sinha reached out to the New York Division of Human Rights as a hate crime resource. Since Tan and Sinha both live or work in New York, they wanted assistance filing hate crime complaints with New York State Police. \u201cWe\u2019re all in different states,\u201d Tan told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to arrest somebody. Unless she tries to physically harm us, there\u2019s not much we can do.\u201d Every state has different laws, Sinha said. \u201cIt depends on where you are and where the perpetrator is.\u201d As a lawyer, Sinha believes there is no question that S. is breaking various laws: defamation, aggravated harassment, disorderly conduct, stalking, hate crime motivations. Some of these charges could rise to the level of felonies. Yet even with all of Sinha\u2019s knowledge, efforts, documentation, and research, he has been stonewalled. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get some traction here,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know who could.\u201d It\u2019s extraordinary how indifferent police have been, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a real struggle. You just need commitment from the law enforcement side, and you need a very clear and easy-to-prove violation.\u201d\n\u201cWe have enough experience with her to know that this is probably not the end of the problem,\u201d Sinha told me. It turned out he was right.\nI have taught journalism in academia for over a decade and have watched threats to teachers grow worse over time. In 2015, I became concerned about a student who professed having a crush on me, despite knowing I am married, and who told a colleague about his sexual feelings toward me. I reported my concerns about the inappropriate comments to my school. His behavior escalated. He already had a criminal record, including charges of sexual violence, and he talked about killing people and writing a book about it. Frightened students reported his conduct as well. His reading responses also turned dark, discussing rape and describing ideas of criminal activity, along with a lack of empathy toward murder and disaster victims. My department, program directors, and our humanities dean supported and backed me when I raised worries. But when other officials got involved, including the school police, the counseling center, and a campus dean, I was made to feel like I was being an alarmist. My own self-doubt crept in at first, and I found myself asking: Had I been too nice to this person? To make him falsely assume there was some romantic connection? \u201cI don\u2019t find him scary,\u201d one campus official working on the case said. Instead, I was informed we would make a plan to help this individual graduate. My teaching assistant and I endured and kept up instruction. Though he was not allowed to attend class in person, I spent those weeks checking door locks and plotting how I might handle an attack on my class \u2014 an agonizing mental exercise for a journalist who has also covered the immediate aftermath of college massacres, such as the one that killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007. My assistant for the course, a graduate student in the MFA program, also struggled, and the experience, among others, helped her realize she did not want to seek full-time employment in a university system again. \u201cThere were about two weeks where I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d she told me recently. \u201cI would have really bad nightmares. I was worried about the students, but also for myself and for you.\u201d She kept thinking: What if something terrible happened? And it could have been prevented, she said, if we just had \u201csupport from the people power.\u201d Neither of us realized at the time that, as employees, we also could have reported the situation on our own to the Title IX office. Instead, to avoid the risk of the student showing up unannounced, we moved our class of around 50 undergraduates to a secret, unlisted location. But much of this prevention was happening on the ground, and it was spearheaded by my program directors, not from the powers above. Once the school year ended and the student graduated, my worries about his behavior dissipated but never fully went away. In the online world, other professors have not been able to move past their own harassment so easily. \u201cDeans and chairs are often unaware at all of how online abuse is actually affecting their faculty,\u201d Victoria O\u2019Meara told me. \u201cA lot of the attacks \u2014 while they may graduate to things like emails or even, in a horrible instance, people showing up on campus \u2014 they often start on social media.\u201d She explained that dealing with harassment on campuses so far has often relied on policing and a more punitive model. Less attention, O\u2019Meara said, is directed toward the well-being and mental health of the targets of the abuse, the faculty and staff. This, she added, is an area where universities and colleges can step up. It could begin with having more conversations among faculty members about stalking and harassment and institutions putting in place stronger digital protections for all employees. Resources might also involve paying for services like DeleteMe, which scrub the web of their private information, like home addresses, and providing more training for staff on online abuse, especially at a time when funding agencies are increasingly asking researchers to do more public engagement. Accessibility to academics online, she added, has only heightened their visibility and vulnerability. Professors use Twitter, now known as X, and Facebook to collaborate and connect with researchers in their field. Some also use TikTok or Instagram to promote their research. \u201cIt\u2019s not really possible anymore to be an active member of your research community without being on social media,\u201d O\u2019Meara said. Yet existing workplace harassment policies have yet to figure out how to prevent or protect faculty and staff from abuse, she explained, especially if the culprit is not someone under the authority of the institution. This reality leaves those of us who teach feeling pretty helpless, vulnerable, and always at risk of being threatened or harassed with little recourse available. \u201cA lot of the people we talk to,\u201d she said, \u201chave their hands in the air.\u201d\nSinha fell asleep, as he does every night, the echoes of S.\u2019s comments still in his subconscious.\n\nThis article, authored by Erika Hayasaki, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-25 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":136}
{"title":"Day of Reckoning -- featuring Anthony Joshua, Deontay Wilder: Predictions, undercard, odds, picks, start time","context":"## Day of Reckoning -- featuring Anthony Joshua, Deontay Wilder: Predictions, undercard, odds, picks, start time\n\nThey might not be fighting each other this weekend in Saudi Arabia but Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder each enter separate tests on Saturday that could be the final hurdle before seeing the former heavyweight champions finally share the same ring in early 2024.\nJoshua (26-3, 23 KOs) welcomes former title challenger Otto Wallin (26-1, 14 KOs) in the main event of a blockbuster pay-per-view card dubbed \"The Day of Reckoning\" from Kingdom Arena in Riyadh (live on DAZN beginning at 11:30 a.m. ET --subscribe now). Wilder (43-2-1, 42 KOs), meanwhile, returns from a 14-month layoff to face former champion Joseph Parker (33-3, 23 KOs) in the co-main event as Saudi Arabia continues to pour money into the sport of boxing to make the kind of fights that have been difficult in the past.\nConsidering the 34-year-old Joshua, who lost his trio of titles to Oleksandr Usyk in 2021, has been linked to talks of a fight against Wilder, 38, dating back to when both first became titleholders in 2015, the prospect of them fighting in March, in the first of a rumored two-fight deal, is incredibly exciting.\nThat doesn't mean it's difficult not to ask the knee-jerk question most boxing fans are thinking: After such a long build toward this seemingly inevitable fight, why not just pair them together now?\nEddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport, Joshua's long-time promoter, cut right to the chase during a recent interview with \"Morning Kombat,\" referencing how hastily this weekend's card was assembled after months of rumors that the two heavyweights could appear on the same card.\n\"I think we had six weeks and the card was put together quickly,\" Hearn said. \"By the way, I think Otto Wallin is a very dangerous fight six weeks out. [Joshua] is in there with a southpaw who is just coming off a victory over [former cruiserweight titleholder Murat] Gassiev. And Joseph Parker is full of confidence and Wilder has been out for a long time.\n\"But, look, the reason they are fighting on the same card and the reason we are all going to Saudi Arabia is that we want to make Joshua and Wilder in Saudi Arabia. But everybody wants that fight to happen and if they both win on [Saturday] there is a great chance that you see what I think is the biggest fight in boxing.\"\nThe main problem with marination in boxing over the past few decades is that placing big-name fighters into bouts they could lose -- which is the case for both Joshua and Wilder, despite each being sizable betting favorites -- has proven to be a major mistake because of upsets. In this case, neither Joshua nor Wilder are champions, so it's possible that the fights against each other still take pace, regardless of defeat, simply due to the sizable investment from Saudi Arabia.\n\"I think a win makes it look great on paper for both of us [in terms of] fighting each other,\" Wilder said during Monday's \"Morning Kombat\" interview. \"But it's no added pressure on my end. Maybe for Joshua, there's more pressure for him than I because I know what I'm coming to do. I'm blessed with God-given power and it's natural. There is nothing I have to inject my body with. There is no type of contaminated meat that I have to eat to make me feel some kind of way. I don't have to alter my gloves in any way, it's all natural to me.\"\nAfter coming up empty in the final two fights of his trilogy with Tyson Fury, both of which ended via violent stoppage, Wilder sat out a full year before returning last October to knock out Robert Helenius in Round 1. Wilder went on to enjoy a bit of a spiritual rebirth after attending an Ayahuasca retreat in South America and has been noticeably happier as a result.\nThis is a far cry from the more combative side of Wilder that shared more than a few conspiracy theories as to why he lost to Fury, and even fired co-trainer Mark Breland for throwing in the towel to save Wilder from further punishment in his 2020 Fury rematch.\n\"My mindspace is in a wonderful place. It's in an over-happy place,\" Wilder said. \"I'm always smiling nowadays. It's a joy to be able to enjoy life. Life passes us by so quickly because we are living in borrowed time, nothing is promised. You have to enjoy every moment.\"\nJoshua, the global star from the United Kingdom, has also traversed a difficult road mentally from his pair of title losses to Usyk, which triggered yet another trainer change and more than a few bizarre interviews where Joshua has appeared defensive and agitated. He recently attended a darkness retreat where he spent four days alone in a pitch black room in isolation.\nThe troubles for Joshua appear to link all the way back to his 2019 upset loss to late replacement Andy Ruiz Jr. at New York's Madison Square Garden, which came as part of a much-publicized U.S. debut. Even though Joshua would regain his titles in their immediate rematch, as Ruiz came to Saudi Arabia in obese physical shape, he has been undergoing a bit of an identity crisis as a boxer in the aftermath, even with a pair of 2023 rebound victories over Jermaine Franklin and Helenius (who also fought Joshua as a late replacement).\nCan't get enough boxing and MMA?

Subscribe to Morning Kombat with Luke Thomas and Brian Campbell for the best analysis and in-depth news, including a complete preview of what to expect from both Joshua and Wilder in separate bouts at Day of Reckoning below.\n\"This is just purely about doing the right thing and being 100 percent perfect every second that I am in that ring,\" Joshua told CBS Sports. \"That way I will be victorious and victory will come by knockout if I carry out my plan A, B and C; it will lead me to the KO.\n\"Otto Wallin is a southpaw so he's very tricky. We have to be very clever. He has a character that is very resilient, as we saw against Tyson Fury. He can box off the back foot and come forward so it's going to be a good challenge for us because he's a complete fighter.\"\nWallin, a 33-year-old native of Sweden, is considered much more a live dog than Parker. Standing only half of an inch shorter than Joshua's 6-foot-6 frame, Wallin is a southpaw whose reputation was extremely bolstered in 2019 when he lost a title shot against Fury despite opening up a cut that required 47 stitches above Fury's eye and came close to giving Wallin a stoppage win.\nThe 33-year-old Parker, a New Zealand native who lost his WBO title to Joshua in their 2018 unification bout, is younger than Wallin but not considered as big of a threat to upset Wilder due to the gap in punching power between them. Still, Parker is an experienced boxer who owns wins over Ruiz, Hughie Fury and Derek Chisora. And despite a reputation damaging stoppage loss to Joe Joyce in 2022, has had plenty of experience in recent years under head trainer Andy Lee in the camp of Tyson Fury, who was 2-0-1 in this three fights with Wilder.\n\"Tyson has been very helpful and has given good advice,\" Parker told CBS Sports on Monday. \"[Andy Lee and I] came up with a good plan and have leaned on Tyson for a bit of advice. The big difference is that I don't have the same height and reach [as Fury]. But my strengths are different to his strengths and I will use mine to the best of my ability.\n\"You will see on fight night, I'm going to put on the best performance. I'm going to be quick and I'm going to be fast and I'm going to be punching with a lot of power. I'm going to be deliberate and I'm going to smash his face.\"\nThe undercard is loaded up with other top heavyweights looking to make a splash and stay in title contention as Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk prepare to crown an undisputed champion in early 2024. A win on Saturday for any of these men could put them in line for a shot at one of the four recognized titles at some time next year.\nLet's take a closer look at the rest of this loaded up undercard with the latest odds before getting to predictions and expert picks on the co-headliners.\nDay of Reckoning fight card, odds\nFighter Fighter Weight class Anthony Joshua -455 Otto Wallin +345 Heavyweight Deontay Wilder -650 Joseph Parker +460 Heavyweight Dmitry Bivol (c) -3500 Lyndon Arthur +1350 WBA light heavyweight title Daniel Dubois -220 Jarrell Miller +180 Heavyweight Jai Opetaia -2400 Ellis Zorro +1150 Cruiserweight Arslanbek Makhmudov -1000 Agit Kabayel +650 Heavyweight Frank Sanchez -2000 Junior Fa +1050 Heavyweight Filip Hrgovic Mark De Morio Heavyweight\nDay of Reckoning viewing info\nDate: Dec. 23\n\nDec. 23 Location: Kingdom Arena -- Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\n\nKingdom Arena -- Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Start time: 11:30 a.m. ET\n11:30 a.m. ET How to watch: DAZN PPV (subscribe now) | Price: $39.99\nPredictions\nAlthough the rest of Saturday's super card features recognized names, including 2022 fighter of the year Dmitry Bivol, the majority of matchups are one-sided on paper. Luckily for fans, both Wilder and Joshua have signed up for fights they could very well lose.\nYet, given the amount of money at stake in the pending two-fight series between the two, and the lack of finishing power from both Wallin and Parker, it's more likely things go to plan for the big-money investors who have spared no expenses to not only make the event happen but continue Saudi Arabia's plans to be a new global hub for big-time combat sports events.\nEven with the layoff, Wilder has the power and conditioning to eventually catch Parker, even if the former champion is able to outbox Wilder leading up to a possible late stoppage. For as much as Wilder often gets criticized for his technical disadvantages, despite being a former U.S. Olympic bronze medalist, he has long shown the patience to make opponents pay for even the slightest mistake late in a bout.\nJoshua, on the other hand, will likely have to work harder. He committed too much to being a boxer in both losses to Usyk, when playing the role of physical and mauling puncher could've been a more sound strategy. And was both passive and boring for the majority of his fight against Helenius before delivering a perfect knockout blow that reminded fans of his power and natural finishing skills.\nAs long as Joshua commits to playing the role of the bigger man, it's likely he does enough to take a decision. The same result that would be difficult to see Wallin get the nod for winning unless he does so in dominant fashion given the financial commitment that region has given to employing Joshua's services as a global star.\nWhile it may be a bit more of a dicey walk for Joshua than Wilder on this day, both bouts are expected to be competitive.\nPicks: Wilder via KO8; Joshua via UD12\n\nThis article, authored by Brian Campbell, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-12-23 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":137}
{"title":"Gen Z just saw the worst war in Israel in 50 years break out all over the internet, but they were raised on 'disturbing images'","context":"## Gen Z just saw the worst war in Israel in 50 years break out all over the internet, but they were raised on 'disturbing images'\n\nThe \u201cdisturbing images\u201d warning is one that Gen Z, the first fully digital native cohort, is used to encountering on their lingua franca: social media posts. On Saturday, the Islamic militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, resulting in the worst war the region has seen in 50 years. In three days, more than 1,500 people have died on both sides, and graphic, difficult-to-watch videos have blanketed the internet\u2014from Israeli civilians being captured, tortured, and killed by Hamas militants, to Palestinian civilians screaming in grief, and people on both sides attending to their dead and injured among the rubble.\nIf Gen Z feels like they\u2019ve seen it all, in some ways, they have. This generation, ages 11 to 26, has already lived through numerous historic events, ranging from a once-per-century pandemic, to the Jan. 6 insurrection\u2014an event unseen for centuries in American politics. Then there\u2019s the first major European ground war since World War II in Ukraine, not to mention market crashes in 2008 and 2020 that recall the Great Depression itself. As the first digitally native generation, Gen Z is experiencing it all through videos, images, and articles online, which is shaping their mental health, workplace attitudes, and financial habits in visible ways.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, this Gen Z reporter notes, that 46% of young workers ages 18 to 26 say that they are regularly so distraught over what is happening in the news that they are unable to function at work, according to a 2023 Edelman report. By comparison, 38% of millennials, 24% of Gen Xers, and 19% of baby boomers and older generations say the same.\nEverything about their behavior communicates that Gen Z is just not okay with it. This ranges from their widespread, hell-bent determination to find purpose in work and pushing their employers to have a social conscience, to a sense of despair over their own and the world\u2019s future finances. They have largely given up on saving money and instead dish out for little \u201ctreats\u201d as a way to cope with the larger absurdity of 21st-century life.\nConsider the lifetime that was three years ago, as Gen Z emerged into young adulthood, when online videos of the murder of George Floyd shook the country in May 2020, resulting in a summer of violent Black Lives Matter protests and riots. A year later, people watched as armed right-wing extremists stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, following the election defeat of former President Donald Trump. Then there are school shootings, which have only increased in frequency since Columbine in 1999, with more students documenting the terror on their phones and sharing it online. One of them was the Parkland shooting of 2018, which tragically created the first spokespeople of the post-millennial generation.\nGen Z\u2019s mental health\nGen Z has the worst reported mental health of any generation\u201445% of young people report having \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d mental health, according to a 2018 report by the American Psychological Association.\nOne of the major sources of Gen Z\u2019s distress, of course, is climate change. Nearly seven in 10 Gen Zers say they experience anxiety when viewing climate change content on social media, according to a 2021 Pew Research report. But they\u2019re not just reading about the detrimental effects of human-caused global warming, they\u2019re living through the consequences themselves.\nThis summer reached record-breaking temperatures, with July being the hottest month the planet has seen in over 100,000 years. As a result, Arizona experienced a monthlong heat wave with temperatures at or above 110 degrees every day. Deadly fires broke out across the Mediterranean; suffocating smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed New York City and the Northeast for days; and ice melt in the Arctic accelerated.\nAnd extreme heat is likely here to stay\u2014and get worse\u2014unless countries can rapidly reduce their carbon emissions. That\u2019s why Gen Z is more concerned with sustainability than any generation before them. Just look at Greta Thunberg: The 20-year-old has become one of the best-known environmental activists, famously speaking at the United Nations in 2019 with scathing words for world leaders:\n\u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I\u2019m one of the lucky ones,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cPeople are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\u201d\nGen Z in the workplace\nBy 2030, Gen Z will account for nearly one-third of the U.S. workforce, but they\u2019re already radically redefining the meaning of work.\nGen Zers want a sense of purpose, so they prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) in the workplace, which encompasses their companies taking accountability for their sustainability and environmental impacts, providing education and awareness for social issues, and ensuring diverse and inclusive boards and teams.\nAnd it tracks: Roughly two-thirds of Gen Zers say they frequently speak about important societal issues while at work, according to the Edelman report. They\u2019re also influencing their older coworkers when it comes to areas like work-life balance, fair pay, and employers\u2019 involvement on social issues.\nGen Z\u2019s financial stress\nBut don\u2019t forget, Gen Zers have also lived through a global pandemic that shuttered the world for nearly two years, two recessions, and a mounting student debt crisis, leaving them with little savings but an abundance of financial despair.\nRoughly 60% of Gen Zers say they are stressed about money this year more than last year, according to a Bankrate survey from July. It\u2019s no surprise either\u201485% of Gen Zers say that they couldn\u2019t afford one month\u2019s expenses if they lost their job today.\nAnd since young people are typically affected by inflation the most, as they are the most likely to work part-time or low-paying jobs, this economic climate may have left Gen Z with permanent \u201cpsychological scars,\u201d one expert says.\n\u201cHow can young people build careers or wealth if they don\u2019t have jobs, and prices of goods and services continue to increase?\u201d Dayo Abinusawa, founder of London\u2019s Awa Business School and a former lecturer at Cambridge University\u2019s Judge Business School, previously told Fortune.\nOne Fidelity survey backs this argument: 45% of 18- to 35-year-olds \u201cdon\u2019t see a point in saving until things return to normal.\u201d Some Gen Zers have even adopted the mentality that \u201cmoney isn\u2019t real\u201d and are justifying spending on items to \u201ctreat themselves\u201d amid a bleak reality.\nWhy it matters\nOf course, every generation has lived through era-defining historical events. Millennials remember the 9\/11 terrorist attacks and the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Baby boomers lived through the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. But no other generation has been plugged into the world through the internet from such a young age like Gen Z.\nGen Z is already wielding their power in notable and sometimes comical ways. In June 2020, teenage TikTok users (with the help of K-pop fans) claimed to have sunk a Trump campaign rally by registering for thousands of tickets with no intention of actually attending. And last summer, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a then-19-year-old activist raised over $2 million in abortion funds by trolling Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz.\nIt remains to be seen what they will do when Gen Z comes into decision-making positions in the workplace\u2014perhaps they\u2019ll channel their rage and cynicism effectively as some have already demonstrated\u2014but Abinusawa warned that \u201ca society where the young have little to no hope for the future is not a sustainable one.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Paige Hagy, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-10 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":138}
{"title":"Patterns of Surface Warming Matter for Climate Sensitivity","context":"## Patterns of Surface Warming Matter for Climate Sensitivity\n\nOne of the grand challenges in climate science is to reduce uncertainty in estimates of climate sensitivity, which quantifies how much Earth\u2019s surface warms in response to a doubling of carbon dioxide relative to preindustrial levels. This uncertainty is large because climate sensitivity aggregates myriad processes, from microscale aerosol-cloud interactions to planetary-scale atmospheric and ocean circulations, into one number. Clouds, which are notoriously difficult to measure and simulate, are the main driver of the uncertainty.\nVarious lines of evidence are used to estimate climate sensitivity, including climate model simulations of varying complexity, observations over the past century, proxies that measure climate change in the distant past, and theory. The likely range of estimates of climate sensitivity was stubbornly constant at a distressingly imprecise 1.5\u20134.5 K for several decades, but the research community\u2019s efforts have recently chipped away at this range (Figure 1).\nEarly in the 2010s, a substantial discrepancy was noted between estimates of climate sensitivity derived from climate models and estimates based on the observed warming record and radiative balance, the balance between incoming and reflected solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation. Estimates based on observed warming pointed to much lower values than those derived from models. A key breakthrough toward solving this conundrum has been the recognition of the pattern effect, the process whereby climate sensitivity depends on the geographic pattern of surface warming. This advance was rated as one of the most promising avenues for further constraining climate sensitivity in the future [Forster et al., 2021].\nForcing, Feedbacks, and Climate Sweet Spots\nAdding greenhouse gases to Earth\u2019s atmosphere leads to a global energy surplus (less terrestrial radiation escapes to space), referred to as forcing. To restore the energy balance, the planet must warm. But warming causes changes in the climate system: The concentration of water vapor\u2014a greenhouse gas\u2014in the atmosphere increases, the spatial coverage of highly reflective snow and sea ice decreases, and cloud properties change. These and other radiative feedbacks amplify or dampen how much the planet warms in response to the forcing. Hence, for a given forcing, the feedbacks determine the climate sensitivity.\nA degree of global warming spread out evenly will cause a different radiative response than if that same warming is concentrated in a climate sweet spot.\nFor decades, researchers assumed that global mean radiative feedbacks mostly depend on global mean temperature [Gregory et al., 2004]. However, they also depend on the spatial pattern of surface warming: Much like applying a force uniformly over someone\u2019s entire body will elicit a very different reaction than tickling the soles of that person\u2019s feet, a degree of global warming spread out evenly will cause a different radiative response than if that same warming were concentrated in a climate sweet spot (a location where surface warming produces efficient radiative damping).\nA wide variety of processes affect the evolution of surface temperature, from greenhouse gas forcing and regional aerosol forcing to natural oscillations involving the ocean and atmosphere to the continental boundary conditions and the extent of ice sheets and sea ice. The pattern of surface temperature change over the past 40 or so years featured a pronounced spatial structure, with some locations even cooling in spite of the global mean warming on the order of 1 K (Figure 2, bottom left).\nFig. 2. At left is the surface and vertical structure of warming observed over the past few decades in the tropical Pacific. Strong warming in regions of deep convection such as the western Pacific is communicated throughout the troposphere and leads to strong warming aloft, enhancing radiative emission to space. In contrast, parts of the eastern Pacific have cooled. Warming aloft and cooling at the surface enhance the lower tropospheric inversion strengths in the eastern Pacific and promote extensive shallow cloud cover that reflects solar radiation and keeps Earth relatively cool. At right is a typical representation of climate change simulated with coupled climate models, which create their own surface warming pattern that differs from the observed one. In coupled model simulations, warming aloft is less pronounced, and relative to the observed case, the lower tropospheric inversion strength is decreased, and cloud cover is reduced through time. Both factors lead to less efficient cooling near Earth\u2019s surface in models than in nature.\nFeedbacks involving clouds and the atmospheric temperature structure are most sensitive to spatial differences in warming. Deep convection in the warmest tropical regions readily communicates surface conditions upward throughout the troposphere (up to about 10\u201315 kilometers) and then horizontally across much of the globe, making the western Pacific a climate sweet spot. This warmer air sitting atop the relatively cool waters in the eastern Pacific or Southern Ocean acts to stabilize the lowermost troposphere, allowing more extensive low-lying stratus and stratocumulus clouds to develop. Because of their location and structure, these low clouds efficiently cool the planet and offset some of the initial warming (Figure 2, top left).\nApproaching the Problem from Different Angles\nThree strands of research have converged over the past few years, highlighting that understanding the pattern effect benefits from contributions from virtually all climate research communities.\nHistorically, three strands of research have highlighted the dependence of radiative feedbacks on the surface warming pattern. The first strand came from analyses of climate feedbacks and sensitivity in model simulations of unequilibrated, transient climate change. If feedbacks were constant, the expected equilibrium temperature change (climate sensitivity) could be estimated using a very simple energy balance model that linearly extrapolates the relationship between global temperature change and radiative imbalance [e.g., Gregory et al., 2004]. When longer, fully equilibrated simulations became available, it became evident that the simple estimation methods assuming constant feedbacks systematically underestimate the actual equilibrium climate sensitivity. The reason for this underestimation is indeed the evolution of the surface warming pattern, which initially emphasizes more stabilizing radiative feedbacks but later, during equilibration, emphasizes less stabilizing radiative feedbacks [e.g., Senior and Mitchell, 2000; Rugenstein et al., 2020].\nThe second strand related the idea of constant feedbacks to the efforts of estimating equilibrium climate sensitivity from the historical record, as mentioned above. Feedbacks calculated from observations or from atmosphere-only model simulations forced with the observed surface warming pattern over the past couple of decades imply less warming than those from model simulations with a fully interactive ocean, which have the freedom to create their own surface warming patterns [e.g., Gregory et al., 2020].\nThe third strand of research came from oceanography, showing that the atmospheric cooling effect of ocean heat uptake differs depending on where it occurs: One unit of ocean heat uptake in high latitudes cools Earth more effectively than the same unit taken up by the low-latitude oceans. This difference is relevant because the largest heat uptake by the ocean occurs at higher latitudes. The effect, termed ocean heat uptake efficacy, turns out to be another manifestation of the dependence of radiative feedbacks on surface temperature patterns [Winton et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2021].\nThe three strands of research have converged over the past few years, highlighting that understanding the pattern effect benefits from\u2014and perhaps requires\u2014contributions from virtually all climate research communities studying large-scale ocean-atmosphere coupling and the dynamics that set regional to global responses to external forcing.\nTo foster this work across communities, 140 scientists from around the world and from different disciplines gathered for a US CLIVAR (U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability Program) workshop in May 2022 in Boulder, Colo. Below, we present the current consensus that emerged during the workshop and raise questions that require urgent attention from scientists.\nThe Past Is a Poor Analogue for the Future\nResearch on the pattern effect has exposed limitations of using equilibrium climate sensitivity to constrain future warming and, conversely, of using recently observed warming to constrain equilibrium climate sensitivity. The foremost implication of the pattern effect is that historically observed climate change does not constrain the upper limit of climate sensitivity [Sherwood et al., 2020; Forster et al., 2021].\nThe reason for the poor predictive power of the climate record from past decades is that the observed surface warming pattern caused feedbacks that were more stabilizing than the ones projected for the future. The warming was particularly pronounced in the sweet spots of the western Pacific and the subtropical eastern Pacific\u2014a perfect combination for enhanced radiative damping (Figure 2, left). In particular, low-lying cumulus clouds in the eastern Pacific covered a larger area and reflected more sunlight back to space than studies suggest they will in the future.\nDifficulty in quantifying the pattern effect stems from uncertainties in observed surface temperature trends, the magnitude of ocean heat uptake, and the short observational record of Earth\u2019s energy budget.\nImportantly, the measurement and magnitude of the observed pattern effect are still debated and uncertain. The current best estimate is that the radiative feedback or damping under idealized, long-term carbon dioxide forcing is 0.5 \u00b1 0.5 watt per square meter per kelvin weaker than the radiative feedback seen since the late 1800s [Andrews et al., 2022]; 0.5 watt per square meter per kelvin is similar in magnitude to the single radiative feedbacks that the pattern effect modifies. The wide range of uncertainty opens two contrasting possibilities: The pattern effect might have acted to retard global warming fairly strongly\u2014in other words, mean global warming might have been much higher by now if the recent surface warming had come about in a different spatial pattern. This possibility implies that the pattern effect has the potential to influence future near-term warming rates strongly as the surface warming pattern evolves. The other end of the uncertainty range implies that the pattern effect might have been negligible over the past century and that it might apply only over shorter timescales or in drastically different climate states.\nDifficulty in quantifying the pattern effect stems from uncertainties in observed surface temperature trends, the magnitude of ocean heat uptake, and the short observational record of Earth\u2019s energy budget. Our incomplete quantitative understanding of how clouds react to their environment and how these dependences are represented in the highly parameterized climate models further limits our ability to quantify the full range of the possible and recently realized pattern effect.\nPressing, fundamental questions for climate dynamics concern how surface temperature patterns come about, how Earth\u2019s radiation budget depends on the details of the surface temperature patterns, and the extent to which the two depend on each other. In other words, first, we need to improve our understanding of drivers of sea surface temperature patterns\u2014decadal coupled variability; the pace and spatial structure of ocean heat uptake; and forcing by aerosols, greenhouse gases, and volcanoes\u2014as well as the relative timing of these drivers. An important goal is to explain historical patterns quantitatively and to predict their likely future evolution. Second, we need to quantify the dependence of local and remote top-of-the-atmosphere radiative fluxes on the magnitude, spatial scale, and sign (positive or negative) of surface temperature changes. Third, we have to explain how ocean heat uptake and radiative feedback are connected on various timescales, both globally and regionally.\nInterpreting Paleorecords Requires Caution\nIn the same way that the historical evolution of surface warming and the planet\u2019s radiation budget inform Earth\u2019s future only to a limited extent, analyses of paleorecords for recent and deep time intervals must account for the pattern effect to be applicable to climate projections of the future. For example, the cooling pattern during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) differed from the warming pattern observed currently and from those expected for the next couple of decades and expected in the equilibrium following a doubling of carbon dioxide, not only in sign but also in the spatial distribution of magnitudes. The LGM currently provides the best constraint on the upper bound of equilibrium climate sensitivity [Sherwood et al., 2020], and hence, the details of the pattern effect matter greatly.\nOutstanding questions concern how representative pattern changes in the past century, the past millennium, or quasi-equilibrated times millions of years ago are of expected future changes.\nIn addition to our growing knowledge of the pattern effect, we also have learned that radiative feedbacks depend on global mean temperature itself: Warming Earth by 1 K from the LGM emphasizes different feedbacks (e.g., the sea ice albedo feedback) than warming by 1 K from a Miocene hothouse world or warming from 4 to 5 K in a high-emission scenario in a century or two from today (e.g., the water vapor feedback [Bloch-Johnson et al., 2021]). The pattern effect and the feedback temperature dependence add uncertainties to estimates of climate sensitivity based on the paleorecord, but quantifying their effects would make these records more relevant to constraining climate sensitivity and expected future warming.\nOutstanding questions concern how representative pattern changes in the past century, the past millennium, or quasi-equilibrated times millions of years ago are of expected future changes. The paleorecord could further be crucial for understanding the timescales and relative importance of internal variability, forced response, and extratropical forcing to rates of warming or cooling in the equatorial Pacific in nature and in climate models.\nShould We Trust Model Patterns in Climate Change Scenarios?\nOur understanding of the pattern effect raises the question of whether climate models can reproduce observed warming patterns. Coupled climate models simulate a freely evolving ocean surface and hence have their own expression of internal variability. For example, we would not expect a coupled model to simulate El Ni\u00f1o events at the same time as they happened in nature, except by chance. This feature complicates comparisons between models and observations, especially on decadal timescales and beyond, for which we know little about the spectrum of internal variability in the real world.\nUnfortunately, coupled climate models seem unable to simulate observed surface warming patterns across some key regions in which surface sensitivity modulates clouds, even when they account for internal variability. Most important, models do not re-create observed cooling in the equatorial and subtropical eastern Pacific and Southern Ocean (Figure 2, right), and it is concerning that all models have the same sign of error in the trend patterns [e.g., Wills et al., 2022]. In addition, models strongly disagree about the timescales over which future warming may occur in these regions.\nThe advent of global coupled storm- and cloud-resolving models, which currently can simulate only a few months to years at a time, presents an exciting opportunity.\nOur limited knowledge of the drivers of surface warming pattern biases in climate models hampers our ability to evaluate these biases. We do not know whether these models\u2019 inability to reproduce observed trends is due to biases in how they represent the spectrum of internal variability, aerosol forcing, ocean-atmosphere interactions, deep and shallow atmospheric convection, Southern Ocean cloud-radiative properties, ocean thermocline depth, and ocean circulation or something else entirely.\nThe most pressing question is whether climate model simulations will be as far off from observations in the future as they have been relative to recent past conditions (compare Figure 2, left and right). If this turns out to be the case, how will model biases in surface warming trends be reflected in radiative feedbacks and global mean warming rates? We need to quantify whether coupled models compensate for their bias in the surface warming pattern and radiative feedbacks through erroneous ocean heat uptake rates or aerosol forcings.\nThe advent of global coupled storm- and cloud-resolving models, which currently can simulate only a few months to years at a time, presents an exciting opportunity. How do we evaluate surface warming patterns and radiative feedbacks in these simulations and compare them meaningfully to observations and coarser resolution models, knowing that even several decades are not enough to robustly detect a forced trend in some regions? And most pressing for the communities relying on the coupled models\u2019 climate change projections, To what extent are the remaining carbon budgets [Zhou et al., 2021] with respect to global warming targets, rates of near-term future warming, and detection and attribution efforts contingent on the pattern effect?\nA Collaborative Outlook\nWorking to solve the problems outlined above at the intersection of different disciplines and with input from different research communities will likely benefit related research into, for example, the sensitivity of tropical cyclones and future rainfall changes in the southwestern United States or in South America to surface warming patterns.\nPromising new tools and observations are beginning to emerge. They include targeted model experiments and intercomparisons, extended global satellite observations of clouds and radiation, Argo floats sampling deep-ocean heat uptake, estimates of radiative imbalances before the year 2000, and new observational constraints on clouds\u2019 sensitivity to environmental controlling factors. These developments encourage an optimistic outlook on our ability to quantify the pattern effect and its implications over the next couple of years.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank all participants of the US CLIVAR pattern effect workshop.

{"title":"European consumer groups band together to fight Meta\u2019s self-serving ad-free sub \u2014 branding it \u2018unfair\u2019 and \u2018illegal\u2019","context":"## European consumer groups band together to fight Meta\u2019s self-serving ad-free sub \u2014 branding it \u2018unfair\u2019 and \u2018illegal\u2019\n\nDays after a privacy complaint was lodged against Meta in the European Union over its latest controversial shift of legal basis claimed for processing people\u2019s data for ads, consumer groups across the region are filing their own complaints about what the tracking giant is up to.\nA coalition of almost 20 consumer protection organizations is united in the view that Meta\u2019s switch to railroading users into agreeing to being tracked and profiled so it can keep profiting from microtargeting them is \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d \u2014 breaching EU consumer protection law \u201con several counts\u201d.\nStarting this month, EU users of Meta\u2019s social networks, Facebook and Instagram, are being offered the \u2018choice\u2019 of agreeing to being tracked and profiled by the behavioral ads business in order to continue\/get free access to its products \u2014 or else they must pay it a monthly subscription (of at least \u20ac9.99pm) for an ad-free version of its mainstream social networks. So Meta\u2019s updated offer to EU users is either hand over your privacy or hand over your hard earned cash.\n\u201cThis is an unfair choice for users, which runs afoul of EU consumer law on several counts and must be stopped,\u201d said the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) in a press release announcing the complaint will be filed with the network of consumer protection authorities (CPC) today.\nBEUC has been joined in the complaint by 18 of its member organizations \u2014 a variety of consumer advocacy groups which are located in the following EU member states: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.\nThe groups are objecting both to how Meta has gone about implementing the \u201cpay-or-consent model\u201d \u2014 using what they assess as \u201cunfair, deceptive and aggressive practices\u201d \u2014 and to the model itself, which they dub \u201cillegal\u201d. They have also raised data protection concerns which are already the focus of the complaint sent to the Austrian data protection authority earlier this week by the privacy rights not-for-profit, noyb.\nCommenting in a statement, Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of BEUC, said:\nThe choice the tech giant is currently providing to consumers is unfair and illegal \u2014 the millions of European users of Facebook and Instagram deserve far better than this. Meta is breaching EU consumer law by using unfair, deceptive and aggressive practices, including partially blocking consumers from using the services to force them to take a decision quickly, and providing misleading and incomplete information in the process. Consumer protection authorities in the EU must now spring into action and force the tech giant to stop this practice.\nSummarizing the issues identified with Meta\u2019s model under consumer protection law BEUC writes:\nMeta is partially blocking the use of Facebook and Instagram until users have selected one option or the other, which constitutes an aggressive practice under European consumer law. Through persistence and by creating a sense of urgency, Meta pushes consumers into making a choice they might not want to take.\nIn addition, many consumers likely think that, by opting for the paid subscription as it is presented, they get a privacy-friendly option involving less tracking and profiling. In fact, users are likely to continue to have their personal data collected and used, but for purposes other than ads.\nMeta provides misleading and incomplete information to consumers which does not allow them to make an informed choice. Meta is misleading them by presenting the choice as between a paying and a \u2018free\u2019 option, while the latter option is not \u2018free\u2019 because consumers pay Meta through the provision of their data, as past court rulings have already declared.\nGiven the market power of Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram services in the EU and the very strong network effects of social media platforms (since all your friends are on Facebook and Instagram), consumers do not have a real choice because if they quit the services they would lose all their contacts and interactions built over the years. The very high subscription fee for \u2018ad-free\u2019 services is also a deterrent for consumers, which means consumers do not have a real choice.\n\u201cThe company\u2019s approach also raises concerns regarding the GDPR,\u201d Pachl further noted. And a spokesman for BEUC told us it might, at a later stage, file a complaint about Meta\u2019s data protection compliance with the relevant privacy authority, once it has completed its own assessment of the issues. Although he emphasized it\u2019s too early to say whether or not it will take that step.\nMeta\u2019s lead data protection authority in the EU, Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC), has, for several months, been assessing its pay or consent offer. But it has yet to communicate a conclusion. In the meanwhile, Meta maintains that the model it has devised for obtaining users\u2019 consent to its ads processing complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). (Although the adtech giant also said that when it was claiming performance of a contract and then legitimate interests for the processing \u2014 both of which were subsequently found to be incompatible with the GDPR.)\nThe \u2018pay or okay\u2019 model Meta is seeking to impose on EU users wasn\u2019t actually its invention; it was \u2018pioneered\u2019 in Austria, by the daily newspaper Der Standard \u2014 after which copycat cookie paywalls quickly sprung up on a raft of news publishers in Germany and elsewhere in the EU.\nnoyb has been challenging this \u2018pay or okay\u2019 approach to GDPR consent since 2021\u2014 filing complaints with a number of data protection authorities, arguing the model forces newspaper readers to \u201cbuy back their own data at exorbitant prices\u201d.\nSome DPAs appear to have been sympathetic to local newspapers\u2019 use of cookie walls, seeing it as a way to support the production of journalism. However when it comes to Meta, that argument evaporates as it\u2019s definitely not in the journalism business. Moreover the adtech giant doesn\u2019t even need to produce content to pump around its social networks; it gets all that filler for free from the self-same users it\u2019s now demanding pay a fee if they want to use its services without being tracked and profiled for behavioral advertising. Which, well, makes Meta\u2019s \u2018pay or okay\u2019 model feel like even more of a rip off.\nBack in April, a decision by Austria\u2019s DPA on a noyb complaint about cookie paywalls said users must have the ability to say yes or no to specific data operations \u2014 meaning blanket consent is not an option. But the result left it unclear how cookie paywalls might be operated in a way that\u2019s GDPR compliant and the privacy rights group vowed to fight the decision in court. \u201cThe final decision on \u2018pay or okay\u2019 may be made by the European Court of Justice (CJEU) in the long run,\u201d noyb predicted at the time.\nMeta is likely banking on another multi year round of GDPR complaints, legal challenges and \u2014 finally \u2014 a referral to the CJEU, followed by another long wait before a ruling gets handed down, buying it several more years to run with its new legal basis fix and keep feeding its profits by doing what it likes with Europeans\u2019 data.\nBut the consumer protection challenge could complicate its usual playbook.\nThe CPC has brought more coordinated action on consumer protection concerns in the EU in recent years, bringing multiple consumer groups together to tackle common concerns \u2014 helped by one or more national consumer protection authority which gets appointed to drive the effort. The process also loops in the European Commission to help facilitate dialogue, assess issues and bring pressure to bear on unfair practices.\nThe CPC alert and mobilization process can be quicker than GDPR enforcement when it comes to forcing changes to unfair behaviors. Although it still typically takes months, plural, for the network to coordinate and arrive at a position to press on a trader they believe is infringing the law.\nThe network also can\u2019t impose fines itself. But if issues aren\u2019t resolved through the dialogues and commitments process it shoots for, national consumer protection authorities can still pursue enforcement at a local level. So if, at the end of the day, these consumer advocacy groups aren\u2019t happy with whatever the process of pressing Meta for changes will have achieved they can still press complaints to national authorities to urge them to take enforcement action (and those CPAs have the ability to impose penalties of up to 4% of global annual turnover).\nIn recent times, a raft of complaints to the CPC about TikTok led \u2014 just last year \u2014 to the video sharing social network pledging to improve user reporting and disclosure requirements around ads\/sponsored content; and to boost transparency around its digital coins and virtual gifts. Although BEUC was not ecstatic about the outcome, saying significant concerns remained unaddressed.\nStill, the CPC network may be able to extract some \u2018quick win\u2019 concessions from Meta \u2014 such as requiring it to amend how it presents the available \u2018Hobson\u2019s choice\u2019 to users. Meta could also potentially face pressure to lower the subscription fee to make it more more affordable for users to deny tracking. (Just spitballing here but imagine if it were offering a choice of tracking ads vs paying \u20ac1 a year not to be tracked which wouldn\u2019t look so evidently self-serving.)\nAsked whether the issue for consumer protection authorities is the \u2018pay or consent\u2019 choice Meta is offering or how it\u2019s gone about implementing it, BEUC\u2019s spokesman said the questions are hard to separate as they\u2019re \u201cclosely interlinked\u201d.\n\u201cUnder consumer law, you need an informed and fair choice to purchase such a subscription. The first question is also dependent on compliance with data protection law. If the practice infringes the GDPR, the fact that it infringes a law which aims to protect fundamental rights should in our opinion be considered unfair and illegal under consumer law too,\u201d he told us, adding: \u201cIn any case, the choice is designed in a way that is unfair, aggressive and misleading.\u201d\nThe European Commission itself has an additional oversight role on Meta directly as the company is also subject to the EU\u2019s shiny new Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA). In the latter case its social networks, Facebook and Instagram, were designated as very large online platforms (VLOPs) earlier this year. And, since late August, they\u2019ve been expected to be compliant with that digital rulebook.\nBoth pan-EU laws put restrictions on the use of personal data for advertising \u2014 explicitly requiring consent is obtained from users for such a purpose; and that consent must be as easy to withhold as to affirm. So one issue the Commission \u2014 which is the sole enforcer of the DSA on VLOPs \u2014 might weigh in in the coming months on is whether clicking accept vs digging out a credit card to pay a monthly charge are equivalently easy.\nThe regulation also contains provisions which are intended to combat unfair\/deceptive design, such as targeting choice interfaces that make it \u201cmore difficult or time-consuming\u201d to pick one option over another. Although the DSA\u2019s provisions against dark patterns are only intended to be applied where consumer protection and privacy laws, which also take aim against unfair choices, don\u2019t.\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":140}
{"title":"Meta seeks legislation that would require parents to approve teens\u2019 app downloads","context":"## Meta seeks legislation that would require parents to approve teens\u2019 app downloads\n\nMeta wants to shift the burden of monitoring social media usage among teens back to the app stores \u2014 and to parents. In a blog post published today, Meta\u2019s global head of Safety, Antigone Davis, argues that parents should be responsible for approving their teens\u2019 app downloads and staked Meta\u2019s position in supporting federal legislation that would require parental approval for app downloads for users under the age of 16.\nGuiding its reasoning, Meta pointed to recent Pew research that indicated that 81% of U.S. adults were in favor of requiring parental consent for teens to create social media accounts. While this may speak to popular opinion around parental sentiment, it doesn\u2019t mean that parents have thought through who should be responsible for preventing or allowing teens\u2019 access to social media, or how those apps should operate to protect teens.\nA coalition of 42 states and D.C. are currently suing Meta over its harms to teens and young users, in part referencing findings from Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen. The former employee had provided to news outlets a treasure trove of documents that appeared to indicate Meta understood the harms it was causing \u2014 including things like body image issues among teens \u2014 but didn\u2019t take action. Instagram head Adam Mosseri was later hauled before Congress in December 2021 to defend the app\u2019s teen safety record, but so far, legislators have not come to any decision about how to regulate teen usage of these platforms.\nInstead, Meta began regulating itself, adding new defaults and features that would restrict teens\u2019 access to content on its apps, protect their privacy and limit ad targeting to teens, as well as introducing parental controls.\nIn more recent weeks, a second Meta whistleblower, Arturo Bejar, has come forward to express concerns that Instagram\u2019s approach to protecting teens wasn\u2019t working to keep them safe from sexual predators and unwanted sexual advances and harassment. Hired as a consultant on the matter, Bejar eventually blew the whistle on Meta after seeing issues remain unresolved following years of work. His argument essentially was that the improvements and safety features Meta was implementing were not enough and not effective.\nHowever, a policy position like the one Meta announced today is not something that would have been rushed out in a matter of days as a PR response to Bejar\u2019s claims, but something Meta has been stewing on for some time. After all, the app stores already have age guidelines, so it would seem to follow that they should also enforce them, if enforcement is to be regulated \u2014 or that seems to be Meta\u2019s thinking.\nIf anything, the call to bring the app stores into the fight is a response to the lack of action in Congress to pass online child safety regulations, like the hotly debated KOSA (the Kids Online Safety Act) leaving U.S. states to individually create laws due to a void of federal guidelines.\nUtah, for instance, passed a measure that will require social networks to give Utah parents access to their children\u2019s posts, messages and comments, and would block social media access during certain hours. The governor also signed a bill to prevent social media companies from adding features designed to addict minors to their platforms. A judge in Arkansas recently blocked a law that would have required parental permission for minors to create social media accounts.\nBeyond Meta, Montana also became the first state to ban TikTok, claiming it was being used by the Chinese Communist Party using TikTok to spy on Americans. But Meta\u2019s threat, in terms of teen usage, isn\u2019t one of a foreign power collecting private data on users, but rather risks to teen mental health, body comparison issues and exposure to sexual predators. Montana could easily turn its eyes to Meta next, after the TikTok bill went through.\nThe overhead of managing apps to meet individual state regulations would be a headache for Meta, but Davis also argues it would lead to a lack of teen protection, in some cases.\n\u201cU.S. states are passing a patchwork of different laws, many of which require teens (of varying ages) to get their parent\u2019s approval to use certain apps, and for everyone to verify their age to access them,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTeens move interchangeably between many websites and apps, and social media laws that hold different platforms to different standards in different states will mean teens are inconsistently protected,\u201d Davis said.\nMeta\u2019s proposed \u201cbetter way\u201d of requiring parents to manage a teen\u2019s app downloads pushes the burden back to the app stores and to parents, who often today do not monitor or manage their teens\u2019 smartphone use. But while it\u2019s true that the app stores and smartphone makers would know the ages of their users, requiring parents to approve apps is the equivalent of overriding parental discretion and choice.\nOther entertainment ratings \u2014 like those for TV, movies or video games \u2014 are meant to be guidelines for parents, not laws. Meta\u2019s position that apps are somehow different, then, is a fairly extreme position to take.\n\u201cInstead of designing its products with kids\u2019 safety and privacy in mind, Meta would rather push blame onto parents and other companies to obscure the damage they\u2019ve already done to young people,\u201d said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, a nonprofit devoted to reigning in Big Tech, in reaction to the news. \u201cNo one disputes that Google and Apple need to do more to protect children on their platforms, apps and devices. That fact does not absolve Mark Zuckerberg or Meta for years of willful negligence, and this announcement shows that the company\u2019s outright hostility toward protecting kids is sewn into the fabric of its profit model.\u201d\nApple and Google did not return requests for comment.\nUpdated, 11\/15\/23, 4:40 PM ET, with comment from Tech Oversight Project.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-15 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":141}

{"title":"Bears vs. Vikings live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Monday Night Football' game","context":"## Bears vs. Vikings live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Monday Night Football' game\n\nThe honeymoon period is over for Joshua Dobbs in Minnesota.\nThe folk hero quarterback threw four interceptions in the Vikings' 12-10 \"Monday Night Football\" loss to the Bears, leading a sluggish offense that didn't find its footing until the fourth quarter in a game that Minnesota wouldn't have needed many points to win.\nThe Bears' defense swarmed Dobbs throughout the night, sacking him only twice but bringing a great deal of pressure as the defensive backs made plays. Despite the barrage of turnovers, Chicago largely failed to take advantage. The Bears scored only three points off of the four Dobbs interceptions.\nMORE: How Joshua Dobbs got his 'Passtronaut' nickname\nMeanwhile, Chicago's first turnover of the night \u2014 a deflating fumble by Fields when the Bears had a chance to extend their lead to two possessions \u2014 was quickly turned into a touchdown by the Vikings. It looked like that score might be the difference, particularly after Fields fumbled away the ball again on the next possession, but the Bears' defense put the ball back in his hands in the final minutes. Fields delivered.\nFacing 3rd & 10 outside of field goal range, Fields hit an open D.J. Moore for a 36-yard gain. At that point, all the Bears needed to do was kneel and put Cairo Santos in position to win the game. Santos drilled the 30-yard attempt with 10 seconds remaining, and that would seal it for Chicago.\nMORE: Vikings playoff chances after loss to Bears\nAs he embarks on a crucial stretch that could determine his future with the Bears, Fields flashed the good and the bad. He was excellent on Chicago's opening drive, albeit one that ended without points, but missed throws and costly turnovers allowed the Vikings to hang around. When it mattered most, though, Fields was poised and sealed the Bears' first win over an NFC North opponent since 2021.\nWhile Chicago's hopes are still extraordinarily distant at 4-8, the Vikings saw their playoff chances take a hit on Monday night. Minnesota (6-6) dropped to the No. 7 seed in the NFC with the loss, with the Packers, Rams and Saints all just a half-game behind in the wild-card race. While a win would have put the Vikings in position to compete for the division crown down the stretch, just holding onto a playoff spot will now be a battle for Kevin O'Connell's squad.\nMORE: Latest updates on Justin Jefferson's return date\nThe Sporting News tracked live updates from the \"Monday Night Football\" game between the Bears and Vikings.

The Bears don't score a touchdown and barely take advantage of the Vikings' four turnovers, but they walk out of Minnesota a winner as the Vikings fall back to .500.\nBears 12, Vikings 10\n11:04 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The Bears are back in front! Santos drills it, and the Vikings have 10 seconds to work a miracle.\n11:03 p.m. \u2014 The Vikings are using their two timeouts, but there isn't much they'll be able to do once this hits fourth down. Once the Bears kneel it on third down, Santos will be running out for what should be an automatic field goal.\n11:01 p.m. \u2014 Fields hits Moore for 36 yards! That puts the Bears well into field goal range, and it's exactly what Chicago got Moore to do.\n11:00 p.m. \u2014 A pair of incompletions set up a crucial 3rd & 10 for the Bears. They're not in field goal range at the Vikings' 49.\n10:58 p.m. \u2014 Fields picks up a first down with his legs to take the Bears just over midfield. Chicago doesn't have timeouts, but there are still 85 seconds on the clock.\n10:55 p.m. \u2014 Fields hits Moore for a 16-yard gain on the first play of the drive, gathering some momentum for the Bears ahead of the two-minute warning. Chicago has plenty of time to sneak into field goal range.\n10:52 p.m. \u2014 Now it's the Vikings' turn to throw behind the line of scrimmage, which means it's the Vikings' turn to lose yardage. Minnesota passes on a long field goal attempt and instead will punt it away with 2:36 remaining and the lead just a point.\n10:49 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 Fields loses the ball AGAIN. Josh Metellus knocks it out for the second time, and this time Anthony Barr recovers. This has been an ugly, ugly sequence for the Bears.\n10:47 p.m. \u2014 Fields throws behind the line of scrimmage to Mooney, and Mooney is predictably dropped for a four-yard loss. That play call has not worked for the Bears in this half.\nVikings 10, Bears 9\n10:43 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 The Vikings turn the Fields fumble into the first touchdown of the night!

They want more than three points, but it's early enough that they absolutely could settle for a field goal if it got to that point.\n10:37 p.m. \u2014 Matt Eberflus throws the challenge flag on a nice grab by Addison to give the Vikings a first down. This one looks like it will be tough to overturn...\n10:34 p.m. \u2014 Wow, Jordan Addison would've had a walk-in touchdown, but Dobbs' throw takes him out of bounds. Addison couldn't have been more wide open.\n10:33 p.m. \u2014 Brandon Powell has been the Vikings' biggest playmaker at two key points tonight. He goes 18 yards here to put Minnesota near midfield.\n10:29 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 That's exactly what CAN'T happen if you're the Bears.

Justin Jones nearly had it, but it was Kyler Gordon who came away with it. Everything the Vikings have done on the offensive side of the ball tonight looks like a chore.\n10:24 p.m. \u2014 A third down catch by Jordan Addison extends the drive for Minnesota. Addison only has 25 yards tonight.\n10:23 p.m. \u2014 Ty Chandler gets the ball on second down and gets nothing.

It's 9-3, Cubs Bears.\n10:16 p.m. \u2014 Byron Murphy comes in to break up a third down pass by Fields, and Santos will come out for a long 55-yard field. He's already missed from 48 tonight.\nEnd of third quarter: Bears 6, Vikings 3\n10:14 p.m. \u2014 The Bears are starting to look respectable on third down again, this time completing to D.J. Moore to move deeper into Vikings territory. Chicago still might need another first down to give Cairo Santos a fair shot at a field goal.\n10:08 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 Dobbs throws his third interception of the night! Jaylon Johnson deflected it, Edwards caught it, and interestingly, the Bears have less favorable field position than they would've if it had fallen incomplete.\nAnd Edwards follows it up with the Bears 3rd INT of the game \u203c\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #CHIvsMIN on ESPN\/ABC\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https:\/\/t.co\/J5tLNJHyh1 pic.twitter.com\/2d4C1s2O09 \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 28, 2023\n10:06 p.m. \u2014 After a hold by Jaylon Johnson gifts the Vikings a first down, they still can't capitalize.

Cairo Santos is able to extend the Bears' lead with a field goal, though.\n9:56 p.m. \u2014 Fields runs right up the middle for a first down and a bit more as the Bears look to get into field goal range (or better).\n9:54 p.m. \u2014 Roschon Johnson picks up a first down to keep the Bears' drive alive. He's looked impressive in spurts tonight.\n9:50 p.m. \u2014 Woah! Kevin O'Connell goes for it on 4th & 7, but Hockenson only gets six yards. The play looked good, the Bears' defense looked better.

It's 3rd & 24 for the Vikings, who might just settle for a gain of a few yards to set up the field goal.\n9:27 p.m. \u2014 Another first down by K.J. Osborn drives the Vikings into Bears territory, and the Vikings suddenly find themselves 13 yards from the end zone after Kyler Gordon is called for interfering with T.J. Hockenson. The Vikings have a chance to take the lead with 38 seconds on the clock.\n9:25 p.m. \u2014 What an effort by Brandon Powell to turn around and make a 28-yard grab while falling to the ground.

Chicago is 0-for-6 on its last six third down opportunities. The Bears are preparing to punt after the two-minute warning.\n9:19 p.m. \u2014 Fields hits Moore for a 22-yard gain, but his next pass is nearly intercepted by D.J. Wonnum. Neither offense has been able to string together positive plays since that opening drive by Chicago.\n9:16 p.m. \u2014 Dobbs is nearly intercepted by Jaylon Johnson (again) on third down. The last turnover wasn't Dobbs' fault, but this one should've been a pick. The Bears' defense is all over the Vikings tonight, and Minnesota can't get out of its own way.\n9:13 p.m. \u2014 Addison, trying to make up for the drop that turned into an interception, looks like he goes for 17 yards, but replay shows his knee was clearly down. It becomes a much smaller 4-yard gain.\n9:09 p.m. \u2014 Fields comes under pressure on third down and misses D.J. Moore. He's starting to miss these receivers after a hot start. Somehow, the Vikings will have a chance to tie this game or take a lead before halftime.\n9:04 p.m. \u2014 Dobbs is picked off again! That's two interceptions and just nine passing yards for the Vikings quarterback, but this one doesn't look like his fault - Jordan Addison saw it bounce off his hands. It's Jaquan Brisker with the pick.\n9:01 p.m. \u2014 Another penalty gifts the Vikings a first down... Both teams are piling on the mistakes.\n8:58 p.m. \u2014 A roughing-the-passer call goes against the Bears and gives the Vikings some breathing room early in the drive.\n8:54 p.m. \u2014 Fields overthrows Darnell Mooney on third down, and Mooney gets destroyed in a collision. The Vikings will get the ball back, still somehow only trailing by three. Fields will want that one back.\n8:50 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 Jaylon Johnson intercepts a throw from Dobbs! That just hung up there. The Bears have been all over Dobbs and the Vikings' offense early on. A taunting penalty after the play hurts Chicago's field position.\nBears 3, Vikings 0\n8:44 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The drive fizzles out, and the Bears opt to kick the field goal on 4th & 3. It's good. The Bears are out to an early 3-0 lead, but they've left plenty of points on the board.\nEnd of first quarter: Bears 0, Vikings 0\n8:39 p.m. \u2014 What a play by Fields to get the ball to a wide open Kmet! The Vikings brought intense pressure, allowing Kmet to get wide open and go for 24 yards. The Bears are in business.\n8:38 p.m. \u2014 2nd & 22 becomes 2nd & 27, but the Bears make up 17 yards on two plays. It's 4th & 10, and Chicago is lining up to got for it.\n8:36 p.m. \u2014 Sacks are killing the Bears in this game. Multiple Vikings defenders wrap up Fields for a 12-yard loss and quickly set Chicago back to 2nd & 22.\n8:35 p.m. \u2014 The Bears' offense is picking up where it left off. After Fields takes off for 14 yards, he hits Roschon Johnson for 22 yards to take Chicago into Vikings territory.\n8:31 p.m. \u2014 That's what the Bears got Montez Sweat to do. Sweat sacks Dobbs on third down to force a quick three-and-out and get the ball right back in Fields' hands.\n8:27 p.m. \u2014 A great start for the Bears ends with zero points as Cairo Santos misses a 48-yard field goal. That's a deflating sequence for Chicago.\n8:25 p.m. \u2014 The rookie Ivan Pace Jr. finally gets to Fields and drops him for a five-yard loss. It'll be 3rd & long for the Bears.\n8:24 p.m. \u2014 Fields throws on the run to find Roschon Johnson for a first down, and he quickly follows up with a 13-yard pass to Khalil Herbert. The Bears are driving, and Fields doesn't have an incompletion yet.\n8:21 p.m. \u2014 The Bears have taken it into Vikings territory with a string of short gains. For Chicago, that's progress.\n8:19 p.m. \u2014 Fields finds Moore for a short gain and the first 1st down of the night.\n8:16 p.m. \u2014 The Bears will start with the ball on the road, looking to build early momentum.\n8:00 p.m. \u2014 Will the Josh Dobbs show continue tonight? He\u2019s had good command of the Vikings\u2019 offense in three games since a trade out of Arizona, flashing an especially strong connection with T.J. Hockenson.\n7:45 p.m. \u2014 It\u2019s 15 degrees in Minnesota with a feels like of 2, so the roof will come in handy tonight at U.S. Bank Stadium.\n7:25 p.m. \u2014 Vikings legend Adrian Peterson is in the building to watch his former team.\n7:17 p.m. \u2014 The Bears enter tonight with the No. 1 and No. 4 picks in the 2024 NFL Draft, and they'll remain in those slots with or without a loss thanks to the strength of schedule tiebreaker.\n7:10 p.m. \u2014 Heading into Week 13, tonight's game is the difference between the No. 6 and No. 7 seed for the Vikings. The ramifications could be much bigger than that, though. A loss would mean the Packers, Rams and Saints only trail Minnesota by a half-game in the wild card race, while a win would keep the Vikings well within striking distance in the NFC North.\n6:55 p.m. \u2014 D'Onta Foreman remains out for the Bears, along with CB Tyrique Stevenson.\n6:40 p.m. \u2014 There's no understating the importance of these final six games for Justin Fields, who is fighting to prove he's the Bears' franchise quarterback.

The longshot may be playing well, but other players have commanded the spotlight, making it easier for them to go unnoticed.\nWhatever the reason, they have not gotten the credit they deserve. However, with five weeks left in the regular season, there is plenty of time for a longshot to become a contender.\nBut if you wait too long before placing a bet, your payout will be a lot less than if you were to roll the dice on a longshot right now.\nLongshots to consider for NFL MVP, OPOY, DPOY, Coach of the Year and Comeback POY\nThere is always a reason why a player or several players have relatively short odds \u2014 they've been the best at their position throughout the season. Consequently, there is just as good a reason why longshots have odds as long as they do.\nSo, keep your bets small, or use a bonus bet (if you have one available), on longshots. If they do go on to win, smile all the way to the bank while you tell everyone, \"I told you so.\"\nRELATED: Best NFL Betting sites | How to bet on the NFL\nNFL MVP\nCurrent favorite(s): Brock Purdy , Dak Prescott , Jalen Hurts\n, Dak Prescott , Jalen Hurts Longshot(s): C.J. Stroud , Jared Goff\nThe MVP often ends up being someone, typically the quarterback, from one of the top-seeded teams. Hence, Brock Purdy, Dak Prescott and Jalen Hurts sit atop betting boards after Week 13.\nBut, by that logic, Jared Goff should be in the conversation. He has played well this season \u2014 his Lions are 9-3, poised to win the NFC South and in contention for the No. 1 seed in the conference.\nCompared to the 49ers, Cowboys and Eagles, Goff and the Lions may have the easiest schedule to finish the season.\nBut bettors should also pay attention to C.J. Stroud. He leads the league in passing yards, is one of four quarterbacks eho have started the whole season with a passer rating over 100, and his touchdown to interception ratio is the best in the NFL (4 to 1)\nAs for the value of his play, Stroud has taken one of the worst teams in the NFL (11 total wins the last three seasons) and turned it into a playoff contender and potential division champion.\nOffensive Player of the Year\nCurrent favorite: Tyreek Hill\nLongshot: CeeDee Lamb\nThere's a good reason why Tyreek Hill is such a heavy favorite to win OPOY. The Dolphins wide receiver is on track to become the first player with 2,000-plus receiving yards in a single season.\nBut there is a solid chance he does not hit that mark. Of Miami's five remaining opponents, four have pass defenses ranked in the league's top eight. If he slows down, someone like CeeDee Lamb could catch up.\nBased on his current season average, Lamb is on track for close to 1,600 yards, but based on his production over the last seven games, he could finish with closer to 1,800 yards.\nHe will probably need Hill to fade down the stretch to have a shot. But if Hill does and he continues to produce, Lamb could steal OPOY from Hill.\nDefensive Player of the Year\nCurrent favorite(s): Micah Parsons , Myles Garrett , and T.J. Watt\n, Myles Garrett , and T.J. Watt Longshot: Danielle Hunter\nHunter leads the league in tackles for a loss and is third in sacks with 13.5 (behind Khalil Mack and Watt). Not only has he produced at a high level, but his play has been instrumental in the Vikings turning things around after a 1-4 start.\nHe may not have the name recognition that Parsons, Garrett and Watt have, but he has played as well, if not better, this season. If he can continue to produce, he at least deserves to be in the conversation, if not win.\nCoach of the Year\nCurrent favorite: Dan Campbell +200 (via DraftKings)\nLongshot: Sean Payton +2200 (via DraftKings)\nCampbell has done a tremendous job with the Lions, but it is fair to wonder if he's the betting favorite because of how well he has done his job this season or over the last two. This year, the team benefited from the groundwork laid last season.\nIf there were a reward for the best coach over two seasons, he would deserve it. As for this season, not so much.\nSean Payton should be at the forefront of the conversation. It's one thing to turn around a team that was dreadful last season. But he has taken one that got off to a horrible start and turned things around in-season.\nOh \u2014 and he has resurrected Russell Wilson's career.\nThat alone should put him at the top of the list, but he may need to get Denver into the playoffs to convince voters.\nComeback Player of the Year\nCurrent favorite: Demar Hamlin\nLongshot: Russell Wilson\nComing back from a life-threatening injury like a cardiac arrest makes Hamlin a great candidate to win CPOY. However, it would be understandable if voters were to look elsewhere since Hamlin has seldom been active on game day and rarely seen the field.\nIt will depend on how vital voters deem playing to be.\nWilson was supposed to be the next great franchise quarterback for the Broncos when they acquired him prior to last season. But rather than lead the team back to prominence, Wilson was terrible and so was Denver.\nThis season, Wilson has played well even when the Broncos have not. He is not producing mind-blowing stat lines, but he is keeping his team competitive, playing efficiently and not making many mistakes.\nUntil his three-interception day last week, he had the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the league. But even with those picks, his is still second-best.\n\nThis article, authored by Travis Pulver, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-05 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":145}
{"title":"Fantasy Football Week 16 Wide Receiver Preview: Waiver adds, DFS plays, and more","context":"## Fantasy Football Week 16 Wide Receiver Preview: Waiver adds, DFS plays, and more\n\nThere will be many difficult decisions to be made in Week 16. It is the Fantasy Football semifinals in most leagues and there is a certain finality to every decision. There's no shortage of things to stress over as a Fantasy manager. Whether or not you start Rashee Rice shouldn't be one of them. While Rice is just WR29 on the season, that's mostly due to a slow start, and his hot start has pushed him into must-start, borderline top-12 territory.\nThe Chiefs' star rookie has four straight games with at least nine targets and he's scored at least 14 PPR Fantasy points in all of those games. Since Week 12, only Deebo Samuel and CeeDee Lamb have scored more PPR Fantasy points that Rice.\nOn paper, the matchup doesn't look great, because the Raiders have been above average in terms of limiting the Fantasy production of wide receivers. But this hot stretch started against the Raiders, when Rice scored 24.7 PPR Fantasy points against them in Week 12. They are playing a style of defense that limits big plays but allows throws underneath which fits Rice and his 4.3 ADOT perfectly. While the Raiders have surrendered the 11th-fewest passing yards this season, they've given up the fourth-most yards after the catch.\nIf Rice is on your roster, he's in your starting lineup. You have plenty of other things to stress about.\nHeath's Week 16 Previews: QB | RB | WR TE\n\nYou can find more in my weekly projections over at SportsLine.

{"title":"Want to help your kids achieve their potential? This expert has some advice","context":"## Want to help your kids achieve their potential? This expert has some advice\n\n\u201cOften a really big mistake parents make is they impose the models of career success that were relevant when they were finishing school,\u201d says the 42-year-old father of three. Loading For instance, before the global financial crisis, he witnessed parents telling their children that the path to a stable and lucrative career meant getting a degree in finance and a job in banking. \u201cThen all those positions disappeared. It was stunning to watch.\u201d The idea that arts degrees are \u201cuseless\u201d is a fallacy, Grant adds. He points to a 2019 study suggesting parents pushed their children towards STEM degrees because they believed those careers would pay well. In the \u201csalary race\u201d, it is true that the science, technology, engineering and maths graduates earn more initially. But those who study history, English or social science degrees and are taught problem-solving, critical thinking and adaptability ultimately catch up, often surpassing their STEM contemporaries.\n\u201cParents may well push their kids in directions that seem to be really practical, but don\u2019t know what employers actually value,\u201d says Grant. \u201cThere\u2019s such a premium on the character skills or what some people call soft skills or behavioural skills: communication, teamwork, leadership.\u201d Soft skills, a term that originated in the 1960s from US Army psychologists tasked with developing proficiency in soldiers beyond the literal \u201chard skills\u201d of working with weapons and machines, are becoming increasingly important in a world where technology may replace other jobs. Adam Grant has advice for parents who want to help their kids reach their potential. Grant recounts chatting with a \u201cvery influential person in tech\u201d, who told Grant it was impossible to plan a career more than a couple of years ahead \u2013 when he graduated from university, the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk hadn\u2019t yet finished school. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t predict what kinds of companies were going to exist, and we didn\u2019t know what kinds of jobs were going to exist,\u201d he says.\nNow, generative AI is upending work in brand-new ways and inevitably changing the future of work and jobs yet again: \u201cI think it\u2019s awfully arrogant to assume that you can tell your kids what a stable career looks like.\u201d By directing our kids down a path that is not of their choosing, there are several likely outcomes, Grant suggests. \u201cI think it\u2019s awfully arrogant to assume that you can tell your kids what a stable career looks like.\u201d Adam Grant They fail to thrive, or burnout because they end up in a job that is not aligned with their values, interests and skills; they resent you; or they rebel and deliberately do the opposite. How, then, can parents support their children to achieve their potential?\nPotential is not innate, it\u2019s developed Seeing natural talent in others can make us discount our own \u2013 or our kid\u2019s \u2013 abilities in a certain area, as can admiring someone at their peak without considering how far they\u2019ve come. Loading Yet in Grant\u2019s book, he illustrates the experiences of those whose potential was not immediately obvious \u2013 including his own. Though Grant eventually became a diver on the junior Olympic team, when he first tried out for his school diving team, it seemed like a hopeless pursuit. The coach told him that the sport required grace and flexibility, but that Grant walked like Frankenstein, couldn\u2019t touch his toes, and the coach was quite sure his grandmother could outjump him.\nSimilarly, though he has become a New York Times bestselling author three times, he failed the mandatory writing test in his first year at Harvard and was instructed to do a remedial writing course \u2013 one reserved for \u201cjocks and international students who spoke English as a fifth language\u201d. \u201cA lot of people believe passion is out in the world waiting to be discovered,\u201d Grant tells me. \u201cIf you can just turn over the right stone you\u2019ll find the thing you love.\u201d \u201cParents may well push their kids in directions that seem to be really practical, but don\u2019t know what employers actually value,\u201d says Grant. Credit: Janie Barrett It\u2019s hard to enjoy something when we find it hard, or we are failing. But progress can be a result of passion, just as passion is an outcome of progress. \u201cToo often what we do is take on a new hobby or skill or task and say, \u2018Oh this is not fun, it\u2019s not for me\u2019, as opposed to saying, \u2018I\u2019m not good at this yet, let me see once I get a little better if I like it\u2019.\u201d\nIn both writing and diving, he focused on his own growth and progress and relied on the guidance of credible mentors (in Grant\u2019s case, his diving coach, who was ultimately his greatest champion, and teachers who knew him well and believed in his capacity to be a great writer). Loading How do you know if you\u2019ve achieved your potential? We often look to extrinsic rewards \u2013 titles, money, awards \u2013 as the metrics of success. But, Grant argues: \u201cThey are status symbols that we use to broadcast to others and to ourselves that we matter and I think they are really poor proxies for mattering. I think we have all been in situations where we can admire people not for what they\u2019ve achieved but for who they\u2019ve become or what they\u2019ve contributed to others.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Berry, was published by The Age on 2023-12-01 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":147}
{"title":"The 5 biggest mistakes parents make at Christmastime, according to a parenting expert","context":"## The 5 biggest mistakes parents make at Christmastime, according to a parenting expert\n\nPressures are high for parents and caregivers around the holidays.\nThat means there\u2019s room for error, according to parenting expert Hannah Keeley, who offered up some of the biggest mistakes parents tend to make at Christmastime.\nIn an email she sent to Fox News Digital, Virginia-based Keeley identified the top five holiday blunders that parents often make.\nHOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS? HERE'S HOW TO AVOID STRESS AROUND FAMILY MEMBERS, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS\nHere are the mistakes Keeley thinks parents should try to avoid.\nDiving right in \u2026\n1. Creating unrealistic expectations\nParents who make a \"must-do\" Christmas list that\u2019s a \"mile long\" at the \"first sniff of peppermint mochas\" are perhaps setting themselves up for failure \u2014 and Keeley said she empathized with this instinct.\nDoing the most could lead to a season of disappointment, she warned.\nCHRISTMAS TREE SHOPPING? HERE'S HOW TO SELECT THE PERFECT ONE FOR YOU\n\"Aside from the time I asked my husband to turn our bathroom into a Hallmark movie and he actually pulled it off, unrealistic expectations around Christmas usually just set up moms for inevitable disappointment,\" Keeley said.\n\"Beautiful family Christmas memories can be made without the drive-in \u2018Grinch\u2019 movie, the tacky light tour and the neighborhood Christmas cookie bake-off all in the same weekend.\"\nInstead, parents should \"take it easy and leave plenty of room to relax,\" said Keeley.\n2. Using Christmas as a bribe\nWhile it\u2019s easy for parents to use a message of \"be good or else\" as a parenting tactic before Santa Claus comes down the chimney, Keeley said this approach lowers parenting standards.\n\"I refer to this tactic as \u2018stooping to Santa,\u2019\" she said. \"Don\u2019t lower your parenting standards to bribery, especially around a season and a character that is supposed to symbolize peace and goodwill on Earth.\"\nThe Santa bribe turns the focus of Christmas into \"selfish gain on the part of your children,\" Keeley added.\n\"Love your kids enough to learn how to manage their behavior appropriately and teach them self-discipline.\"\n\"It\u2019s also lazy parenting, which never pays off in the long run,\" she said. \"Being a mom is a professional career and deserves to be treated accordingly.\"\nShe added, \"Love your kids enough to learn how to manage their behavior appropriately and teach them self-discipline.\"\n3. Becoming a \u2018holiday martyr\u2019\nIt\u2019s important to keep the holidays well-rounded, Keeley said.\n5 HOLIDAY DECORATING MISTAKES THAT COULD REDUCE YOUR CHEER THIS YEAR\nShe called out \"martyr moms\" who are at their \"peak performance\" during Christmastime, putting everyone else before themselves.\n\"They wear themselves out making sure everyone else has the perfect Christmas, but never put themselves on the receiving end,\" she said.\nThese parents, said Keeley, \"subconsciously compensate for a lack of self-worth and validate their role as a [parent] by creating too much busyness in their life.\"\nShe said that \"all that results from a mom who runs herself into the ground is just that: a mom who runs herself into the ground.\"\nDELICIOUS CUT-OUT SUGAR COOKIES FOR CHRISTMAS: TRY THE SIMPLE RECIPE\nShe added, \"If this is you, take a breath, put away the to-do list and ask yourself, \u2018What would I have to believe in order to have a relaxed and joyful Christmas?\u2019 Maybe we can use that as a guide to sit back and relax.\"\n4. Griping like the Grinch\nParents should be sure not to be \"grinchy\" around their kids amid holiday stress, Keeley said.\nChildren up to the age of 9 process information egocentrically, she said \u2014 which means if there\u2019s a problem, they see themselves as the cause.\nWith this in mind, parents should avoid \"processing their frustration around the holidays audibly around the children,\" she said.\n\"The \u2018mom brain\u2019 is wired to process problems rapidly and move on to solutions,\" she said. \"The \u2018child brain,\u2019 however, is wired to process a problem internally and take on the responsibility.\"\nSaid Keeley, \"Knowing this, make sure you don\u2019t do any \u2018grinchy griping\u2019 out loud to the children. You may see it as temporary venting, but they see it as, \u2018Mom is upset and I\u2019m probably the reason.\u2019\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nInstead, parents should stay calm, find a reason to be grateful and vocalize it, even when frustrations accumulate.\n5. Neglecting the \u2018give list\u2019\nWhile building a wish list is fun for kids, Keeley emphasized the moral importance of the \"give list.\"\n\"Many parents make the mistake of teaching their children that Christmas is a time to make a \u2018wish list\u2019 and get what they want,\" she said.\n\"Many parents make the mistake of teaching their children that Christmas is a time to make a \u2018wish list\u2019 and get what they want.\"\n\"This is loads of fun, but can often create a big case of 'the gimmes\u2019 in your children.\"\nShe added, \"Life is balance. It\u2019s about receiving and giving.\"\nAs parents guide their kids to create a wish list, Keeley encouraged them to spend equal time creating a list of gifts to give to family and friends.\n\"Collaborate with them on what they want to give to the people they love, and encourage them to use their imagination and creative ability, not just your credit card,\" she said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Even if it's a pine cone covered in peanut butter and bird seed for loved ones to use as a bird feeder, the gift came from the heart and a beautiful lesson was learned \u2014 that\u2019s the best Christmas gift of all,\" she said.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Lifestyle on 2023-12-09 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":148}
{"title":"NFL Fantasy Football Week 6 Lineup Decisions: Starts, Sits, Sleepers, Busts to know for every game","context":"## NFL Fantasy Football Week 6 Lineup Decisions: Starts, Sits, Sleepers, Busts to know for every game\n\nFantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.\nIt's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.\nWe'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Justin Jefferson). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.\nIt's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected Strength of Schedule rankings our broken down by position available on SportsLine. My objective is to break down how the schedule affects every Fantasy relevant player for the upcoming four weeks, the playoff stretch and the entire season. You'll also be able to find my key takeaways on which players you should buy low, sell high and more trade advice.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jaleel McLaughlin RB DEN Denver \u2022 #38\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ KC KC -10.5 O\/U 47 OPP VS RB 6th PROJ PTS 11.8 RB RNK 26th YTD Stats RUYDS 160 REC 7 REYDS 46 TD 3 FPTS\/G 9.3 There isn't a Broncos running back you'll have much confidence in starting because they'll all split the proverbial pie too much. I'd start McLaughlin over Williams, but I would rather start Brian Robinson, Alexander Mattison, Rachaad White, Jerome Ford and Rhamondre Stevenson.\nLAST WEEK: Despite splitting first-half snaps almost evenly and losing out on second-half snaps considerably, McLaughlin made three splash plays of 21, 22 and 38 yards including a touchdown on a tipped-then-secured designed screen that pierced through the middle of the Jets defense. Those three touches were his best -- his other nine touches each failed to exceed 3 yards. And as mentioned two sentences ago, he played just 10 snaps in the second half when the Broncos were trailing.\nFILM: McLaughlin has good vision and speed, both of which were essential in reading the Jets defense at the first and second levels and choosing the correct paths to run on his big plays. His lateral agility was a differentiator on his touchdown catch. McLaughlin's worst asset is his power as he just won't finish runs with physicality like his backfield mates do. But the biggest detriment is that he can't consistently overcome bad blocking, which has been a consistent problem for the Denver O-line all year and certainly something that impacted Javonte Williams in his first handful of games.\nWHEN TRAILING: When the Jets were up by eight or more points in the second half, McLauglhin played 4 of 15 snaps and had two carries. That's in line with a trend we've seen from Denver all year: Of the 117 snaps they've played when down by eight or more points, McLaughlin has played 26 snaps (13 touches, seven at Chicago), Williams has played 27 snaps (15 touches, almost all against Miami) and Samaje Perine has played 58 snaps (13 touches) -- more than both backs combined. The only guy who's averaged a strong number on the ground in this specific situation? You guessed it -- McLaughlin (6.1 yards per carry).\nCHIEFS: Tend to build leads on their opponents. They also have given up just four rushing plays of 12-plus yards this season, and that includes a fake punt run by the Vikings last week. Kansas City has given up one rushing TD to a running back this season. Impressive numbers considering they're giving up 4.5 yards per carry and rank in the bottom-10 in yards before contact and yards after contact. The secret? Teams don't run the ball that much against them (16.4 attempts per game, fourth-fewest) because ... they tend to build leads on their opponents.\nCHIEFS: David Montgomery and Alexander Mattison are the only two running backs to tally at least 10 Fantasy points (PPR or non-PPR) against Kansas City this year. Both scored.\nBRONCOS: When McLaughlin, Williams and Perine were all part of the Broncos game plan in their Week 3 blowout loss, Williams had the most work (13 touches) and the most PPR points (8.5). The only time a Denver back had 15-plus touches came in Week 1 when Williams had 17 against the Raiders (and had 9.7 PPR points, a season-high).\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nFlex Starter in PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Zay Flowers WR BAL Baltimore \u2022 #4\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ TEN BAL -4 O\/U 41 OPP VS WR 28th PROJ PTS 12.3 WR RNK 28th YTD Stats REC 29 TAR 40 REYDS 317 TD 0 FPTS\/G 12.5 If I had supreme confidence in Baltimore not having much success on the ground then I'd start Flowers without hesitation. But Tennessee's run defense has weakened a bit and the Ravens could be apt to take advantage. Of course there's upside for Flowers to haul in a couple of long targets, and that really is what keeps him in the flex conversation.

We're counting on the Ravens outsmarting the big size of the Titans defensive line and utilizing Hill for his speed along the edges and in the passing game. His high-value touch share is the icing on the cake and hopefully can lead to him scoring just over 12 PPR points for the second week in a row. I'd take my chances with him over low-upside running backs like Gus Edwards, Antonio Gibson and Jonathan Taylor (for now he's low-upside).\nLAST WEEK: I surmised that Flowers would be targeted more if the Ravens run game couldn't get going. Sure enough, it didn't, and Flowers saw a season-high 11 targets at Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, Flowers underwhelmingly caught just five balls for 73 yards with two drops that would have pushed his yardage over 100 had he held on to both targets.\nAIR YARDS: Flowers was targeted downfield more last week than in any game this season with a 15.27 Average Depth of Target (ADOT). It was the first time he had a double-digit ADOT and more than six targets. He lined up wide on the majority of snaps (66.7%) and hitches were still his route of choice but there was more diversity there than before. It's also notable Flowers did this while sharing the field with Odell Beckham and Rashod Bateman back on the field.\nTITANS: Run defense started the season strong but got smashed last week by Zack Moss and the Colts to the tune of 6.3 yards per carry and four explosive runs (they had allowed two total headed into the game). Moss beat a stacked box on his 56-yard TD scamper. And even when Richardson wasn't on the field the Colts averaged 4.7 yards per run against Tennessee.\nTITANS PAST TWO: Against the Bengals and Colts, the Titans allowed at least 2.79 yards before contact per rush in each game and were decimated by zone-scheme runs (at least 6.0 rush yards per carry by RBs).\nRAVENS RUN GAME: Have called zone runs half as many times as power runs even though they average a half-yard better per carry on zone runs. They'd be smart to do more of that this week against Tennessee. Hill has the team's best rushing average and highest rush EPA on zone runs.\nHILL: In the three games he's played the most snaps in (Weeks 1, 2 and 5), he's played 24 of a possible 43 third-down snaps (56%) and 14 of 20 snaps inside the 10. He's smaller than Gus Edwards, but faster and more versatile, and it's given him extended opportunities for high-value touches.\nTITANS PASS DEFENSE: Rank in the bottom-five in catch rate allowed to outside wide receivers (75.8%) but handle them well otherwise (12.5 yards per catch, 3.34 YAC\/reception are both top-10). They're equally adept versus hitch routes and WR screens, Flowers' two most-run routes. Tennessee has allowed exactly 50% of pass attempts of 15-plus Air Yards to all wide receivers be completed for a bottom-five yards per catch allowed rate, but they're league average in YAC\/reception and touchdowns allowed on those throws, and the numbers are a little bit better for them if you discount four hiccups in Week 1.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Terry McLaurin WR WAS Washington \u2022 #17\nAge: 28 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs.

This matchup has an over\/under of 42.5 points, tied for fourth-lowest of the week. Tack on the ascending secondary the Falcons seem to have and the Commanders' diffusion of targets and McLaurin is at best a low-end flex. I'd rather roll the dice on Drake London, Tyler Lockett or Garrett Wilson.\nLAST WEEK: Hopeful that his target edge over his teammates would keep growing, and even in a favorable game script where the Commanders were trailing by three scores before halftime, McLaurin only saw five targets against the Bears' heavy zone coverage.\nFILM: On the 10 third-down routes McLaurin ran last week, he drew extra coverage on four of them, got open on two of them (Howell threw elsewhere) and was a decoy on Curtis Samuel's touchdown. What happened? Sam Howell was getting rid of the ball quickly and to shorter distances as the Bears were getting some pressure on him. By the end of the game McLaurin's body language seemed dispirited.\nCOMMANDERS: Throw to their wideouts on 58.7% of their targets, which is below league average (but not as bad as, say, the Falcons at 36.4%). What makes that number worse is that McLaurin has just one more target (31) than Jahan Dotson (30), who has three more targets than Curtis Samuel (27). They're all nearly even after five games and each of them has had a turn leading in targets at least once.\nFALCONS: Are expected to play a heavy dose of zone coverage, if only because the Commanders have struggled to be explosive against zone coverage this year. Atlanta also gave a full dose of snaps last week to outside cornerback Jeff Okudah, who wasn't flawless but does offer another sizable body to help against stronger perimeter receivers. Between Okudah and A.J. Terrell there isn't a matchup that's great for McLaurin.\nMcLAURIN: Has an impressive 91.3% catch rate versus zone coverage this year, but is averaging just 9.3 yards per catch with it on a sub-9.0 ADOT. His target share is below 20% regardless of the kind of coverage he sees.\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Logan Thomas TE WAS Washington \u2022 #82\nAge: 32 \u2022 Experience: 9 yrs.

The Commanders clearly value the position in their offense, Thomas sees the most throws from Howell, and if Atlanta plays heavy zone coverage then it should mean a bunch of underneath throws for Thomas to take in. You're hoping for at least seven targets here, which is possible. He's worth the nod over Jake Ferguson, Dalton Schultz and Tyler Conklin, and it's close in full PPR over Kyle Pitts.\nLAST WEEK: Thomas was a big-time benefactor of the Commanders chasing points against Chicago's heavy zone coverage, seeing 10 of his 11 targets once the Bears built a 17-point lead in the first half. A 24-yard catch on the final play of the first half against prevent defense didn't hurt either.\nFALCONS: See the third-most targets per game to tight ends (9.0) which in turn has made them bottom-five in raw stats like total catches and yards allowed. But they float around league average in catch rate allowed (77.8%, below league average) and yards per catch (8.9, better than league average). However, no team has allowed more first-down receptions to tight ends (17). Keep in mind, this defense hasn't seen tight ends better than Evan Engram, Sam LaPorta or Dalton Schultz.\nCOMMANDERS: Throw to their tight ends on 26.3% of their throws, fourth-most in football. But that hasn't always meant a huge target share for Thomas. In Weeks 1 and 5 he saw at least 22.9% of Sam Howell's targets. He left Week 2 after suffering a concussion and was absent in Week 3; then was not part of the game plan much in Week 4 (7.7% target share against Philadelphia). Perhaps it's all health related and Thomas' volume from last week will stick.\nZONE COVERAGE: Atlanta usually plays a lot of zone coverage early on and if it works they stick with it for the whole game (Week 5 was an example of that). In Weeks 3 and 4 against the Lions and Jaguars they played much more man coverage, especially when they needed a fourth-quarter turnover. And because Howell is much less explosive against zone looks, I expect the Falcons to stick with zone much more this week.\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Kyle Pitts TE ATL Atlanta \u2022 #8\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

But we've seen four really measly weeks from Pitts before Week 5, so forgive me for not rushing back to him as a must-start tight end. The truth is that the matchup is a little tougher for him and for Ridder, plus teams have beaten the Commanders on deep shots to wide receivers, not lumbering tight ends, so I'm not convinced Pitts will maintain his target share or develop more explosive plays. He's still worth trotting out there over Logan Thomas, Dallas Goedert and Cole Kmet, but keep expectations around 70 yards on six catches.\nLAST WEEK: Came alive against the Texans' zone-heavy defense with season-highs in targets (11), catches (seven) and yards (87). This was his second game of his last three where his target share was over 23%. It was nice to see him as a key part of the offense, but I can't help but notice he played a season-low 53% of the snaps.\nFILM: Two things helped Pitts out: One, he looked a little quicker off the snap and a little faster when running straight. He's still lumbering when he changes directions in his routes but perhaps he's slowly getting healthier. Two, Desmond Ridder seemed very comfortable throwing into tighter windows to Pitts in zone coverage as the two had some good timing down, mainly on dig and out-breaking routes.\nPITTS: Continues to harvest a high ADOT -- last week it was 11.36 yards and on the season it's 11.72, the highest among all qualifying tight ends. He also has the lowest catch rate (56.3%) and worst YAC\/reception average (1.33 yards) among all qualifying tight ends. Of his 208 yards, just 24 have come after the catch.\nCOMMANDERS: Play zone coverage at a slightly lower-than-league-average rate, typically turning to man coverage as soon as games get sideways (like in the second quarter last week or the fourth quarter against the Bills). Opponents average 32.0 pass attempts per game against them, ninth-fewest in football, and against tight ends that line up in the slot or out wide like Pitts, the Commanders rank among the top-five in yards per catch, YAC\/reception and have yet to allow a reception of 20-plus yards.\nDEEP PASSES: The Commanders have allowed the seventh-most receptions of throws that traveled 15-plus Air Yards this season with 19. Of those 19, only two were caught by tight ends (Cole Kmet, Dallas Goedert) and neither went for more than 23 yards.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline K.J.

One: I think the Vikings will try to get their run game going since they don't have Justin Jefferson. Two: Jordan Addison is far more explosive and T.J. Hockenson has been a much more relied-upon weapon. They should have more targets than Osborn. And the expected zone coverage Chicago will play further will limit Osborn unless he sees more targets than expected. He has more upside than Jerry Jeudy, Jahan Dotson and Tutu Atwell but I'd rather take a shot on Drake London, Terry McLaurin or Chris Godwin.\nLAST WEEK: Over 19 snaps without Justin Jefferson last week, Osborn ran 18 routes and caught both of his two targets for 30 total yards. The receiving average was delightful, but the small-sample target share (12.5%) was saddening. What's funny is that Osborn's target share was much higher when Jefferson was playing (23.3%) but his receiving average tanked (6.3).\nFILM: Osborn didn't beat coverage with his speed last week and his burst and agility were just OK. His 22-yard catch came on a Kirk Cousins scramble where he waited in a spot and Cousins hit him, then Osborn ran inside instead of outside where he might have been able to score. He also ducked under an end-zone target instead of leaping for it. It's worth noting that a 36-yard crosser he ran against the Chargers flies in the face of this as he separated from man coverage with speed and technique, then turned upfield and ran outside before racing past a defender and diving for the pylon.\nOSBORN: Has a 50% catch rate on the year and that includes whether he faces zone coverage or man coverage. He sees more targets per route run against man coverage and averages more yards per catch and yards after catch against man coverage. Over his career, targets do seem to come more frequently against man coverage and he has been more explosive with them.\nBEARS: Play zone coverage at the fourth-highest rate of any defense this season (79.2%). And because Cousins is much more explosive of a passer against man coverage, expect Chicago to keep up their zone defense.\nHISTORY: In 20 career games with at least five targets, Osborn has scored at least 12 PPR points in 13 of them. Eleven of those 13 involved him catching a touchdown. Osborn has two career games with over 100 yards -- and one came last January at Chicago.\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Cole Kmet TE CHI Chicago \u2022 #85\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs. If you start Kmet, you're buying into his role as Fields' change-up to D.J. Moore -- and in the case of this week, a change-up to the Bears' depleted run game. I especially like his red-zone role and his touchdown opportunities. I'm ready to chance it with Kmet over Kyle Pitts, George Kittle and Dallas Goedert.\nLAST WEEK: Kmet kept rolling as Justin Fields' second-favorite target, turning five throws into a 5-42-1 stat line versus a Commanders defense that had shut down the Cardinals, Bills and Eagles tight ends to start the season.\nPAST TWO GAMES: Really since the Bears told Chase Claypool to take a hike, Kmet has become a focal point of the offense. He's averaged seven targets per game with a 24.6% target share to go along with four red-zome targets and three end-zone targets. He's second to D.J. Moore in all of those categories except red-zone targets, where he's first -- and by a lot (no one else has more than one, including Moore).\nBEARS: May need Kmet as a short-area target to help make up for some of the run game as the Bears are expected to not only be without Khalil Herbert but also rookie Roschon Johnson. In an effort not to overwork their backs, who won't have it easy against the Vikings, Kmet could handle more short-area throws than normal. His ADOT over the past two games has been 7.64, which isn't far from his season average of 6.69.\nVIKINGS: Allow the fewest yards per catch to rival tigh ends (5.9 yards), even keeping a lid on Travis Kelce last week (6.7 yards per catch). But they've also seen the fourth-lowest ADOT from tight ends (5.0 yards per target), almost as if teams know they won't be able to succeed on downfield shots against them (zero completions of 20-plus yards from tight ends). These numbers are tough but if Kmet gets the target volume we've seen him have over the past couple of weeks he can still put up palatable numbers. And, tight ends have scored three times in the Vikings past three games.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nFlex Starter (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Tyler Lockett WR SEA Seattle \u2022 #16\nAge: 31 \u2022 Experience: 9 yrs.

It may also come to pass that the Seahawks are trailing in the game and thus have to throw. Consider Lockett more of a top-30 receiver who you should sit for Zay Flowers and Gabe Davis but start over Chris Godwin, Nico Collins, Garrett Wilson and Drake London.\nBENGALS: Consistently tailor their defensive coverage to the weaknesses of the offenses they face. So when a quarterback struggles against zone coverage, they'll play more zone. This worked in their favor in all but one game this year (Ravens, Week 2). Cincinnati also has turned on the juice for their pass rush, getting a pressure rate of over 40% in each of their past three games, all versus teams with suspect offensive lines.\nBENGALS: Are expected to be without top cornerback Chidobe Awuzie, and they also are rotating one of their safety spots between Nick Scott and Jordan Battle. D.J. Turner is expected to replace Awuzie.\nGENO SMITH: Has a 47.8% completion rate and a lowly 4.1 yards per attempt average against man coverage so far this season. He's also barely thrown deep (4.3% of his attempts went 20-plus Air Yards). A huge reason for the low numbers is because his pass protection has been dreadful. The anticipated return of left tackle Charles Cross should help him have more time, which in turn helps his receivers.\nOUTSIDE WRs: Have caught just 50% of their targets against the Bengals this season, third-lowest in football. However, when those receivers have caught the ball they've averaged 17.9 yards per catch, which is the third-most in the league. The Bengals defense has really only let up big games to receivers who catch touchdowns.\nLOCKETT: Already the team leader in target share for the season, Lockett sees more targets on a route-run basis against man coverage (28%) compared to zone (21%). He also does better with them, averaging a full 2.0 more yards per catch and with a much higher explosive play rate (14.3% compared to 5.0% against zone).\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSneaky Sleeper (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jeff Wilson RB MIA Miami \u2022 #23\nAge: 28 \u2022 Experience: 6 yrs.

Remember, Wilson's injury was to his abdomen, not his legs, so there might not be much of a limit on how much work he'll do (though it's unlikely he'll have a ton of touches). I'd take my chances with him over Samaje Perine, Jerick McKinnon and Antonio Gibson.\nWILSON: Started practicing this week after being sidelined with finger and abdomen injuries since late August. He and his fresh legs are back just in time as rookie sensation De'Von Achane hit Injured Reserve this week with a knee injury.\nDOLPHINS: Aren't quite the bastion of rushing that some headlines have made them out to be, but they're just over league average in rush rate at 43.7% and above league average in RB runs per game at 22.6. All of these numbers are weighted heavily by their 50-point win over Denver in Week 3 when they ran the ball 42 times with their running backs. Their 7.6 yard per carry average is due to Achane's breakout start more than anything else.\nMcDANIEL: Prefers to use two running backs from game to game, and in Miami's past three games there's been a relatively close split in carries between two backs (18 and 13 in Week 3, 8 and 7 in Week 4, 11 and 10 in Week 5).\nLAST YEAR: Wilson was efficient in his eight games in Miami, averaging 4.7 yards per carry with three touchdowns and just over 60 total yards per matchup. That includes two games he barely played in (under 20 snaps) -- take those out and he averaged 78.2 total yards per game.\nSALVON AHMED? Was a healthy scratch last week and figures to be no better than a special-teams player this week. In fact, in the seven games Raheem Mostert, Wilson and Ahmed were all active for with the Dolphins last year, Ahmed played 18 offensive snaps and 25 special-teams snaps. Wilson played 213 offensive snaps and 10 special-teams snaps.\nPANTHERS: Rank in the bottom five against running backs in rush yards per carry allowed (5.2), rushing touchdowns allowed (right), explosive run rate allowed (9.8%), yards before contact per rush allowed (2.26). Every running back with at least 10 carries against the Panthers this season has posted at least nine non-PPR points. There's been one every game, but multiple running backs have had 10-plus non-PPR points in two games through five weeks.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Zack Moss RB IND Indianapolis \u2022 #21\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs.

It's purely a hunch but because Taylor is still ramping up and it takes as many as four weeks to \"get right,\" Moss should lead the way and could see as many as 15 touches.

I'd view Taylor as at best a bye-week replacement with an eye on his Week 9 matchup at Carolina as his breakout game.\nLAST WEEK: The Colts eased Jonathan Taylor back into action after sitting out the first four games and barely practicing at all. He played just 16% of the snaps to Zack Moss' 80%, and Moss handled nearly every third down, fourth down and snap inside the 10-yard line. Of note, Taylor played just three second-half snaps.\nFILM: Taylor looked as big and strong as I remember, and he wasn't shy about contact at all. I liked how he fought for yardage on pretty much every carry. He did seem rusty when it came to processing his blocking and figuring out where to run -- it felt more like he ran up the backs of his linemen more than scan for space to make cuts and elude defenders. It was a good first step.\nFILM: Moss, meanwhile, had consistently great vision and used his combination of speed and power to crash through the Titans' front, especially when they stacked the box against him on his 56-yard touchdown run. There's nothing to suggest Moss is struggling, which means his playing time doesn't figure to dwindle.\nTHIS WEEK: Colts coach Shane Steichen said he's ramping up Taylor's workload in practice, and the official team website believes Taylor's snap share will increase both this week and as the season goes on. But Moss still figures to be the lead back and handle a majority of high-value touches.\nJAGUARS: Last week's showing against a Bills run defense that was disinterested in running the ball helped push their run defense numbers to new heights. On the season they've given up one touchdown on the ground, 3.6 yards per carry, a 6.0% explosive run rate and 2.27 yards after contact per rush to running backs. Only the explosive run rate doesn't register among the top-six across the league.\nStart Him In PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Michael Pittman WR IND Indianapolis \u2022 #11\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs.

It also helps the cause that the Jaguars aren't exactly terrible against the run (3.6 yards per carry allowed), meaning that the Colts can't easily dominate on the ground for four quarters. He's best as a low-end WR2 in PPR leagues but no better than a flex in half- and non-PPR. For example, I'd start Zay Flowers, Tyler Lockett and Amari Cooper over Pittman in non-PPR, but not in PPR.\nWEEK 1: Came alive in the second half against the Jaguars and finished with a season-high 97 yards on eight catches with a well-documented 39-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown.\nSINCE WEEK 1: Has been above 14 PPR points once (Week 3 at Baltimore, a game Gardner Minshew started). Over the past two weeks Pittman has totaled just 12 targets against the Rams and Titans for six catches and 67 yards. It's a far cry from Week 1.\nMINSHEW: Clearly more of a developed downfield thrower than Anthony Richardson and has thrown at Pittman on 26.4% of his routes run including four red-zone targets and an end-zone target. Even last week when Minshew played less than a half Pittman saw a target once every five routes he ran with Minshew.\nJAGUARS: Rank fifth with a 77.7% zone coverage rate, and they've consistently played a lot of zone in every game. They were also busted up by outside receivers (over 17.0 yards per catch) last week against Buffalo and two weeks ago against the Texans. Pittman tends to play outside more than in the slot. Finally, an outside receiver has scored at least once against the Jags in every game this season, including Pittman back in Week 1.\nPITTMAN: Tends to do better against zone coverage than man, though he was much better last year than this year. This year he's actually been about even in catch rate and yards per catch against man and zone coverage but does have a higher explosive play rate against zone (9.7% compared to 6.7% against man). That tracks back to last year, by the way -- his explosive play rate was nearly twice as high against zone than man.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nFlex Starter In PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Nico Collins WR HOU Houston \u2022 #12\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

Unfortunately, neither of his matchups are particularly favorable. I could see Collins getting a lot of short targets and for that reason alone I'd be OK starting him as a flex option in PPR ahead of Tyler Lockett and Chris Godwin, but behind Jakobi Meyers, Jaylen Waddle and Gabe Davis.\nLAST WEEK: Even in a game where the Texans lost Tank Dell to a concussion before the half, Collins couldn't get much going. That included in the second half when he saw one target and couldn't catch it. He definitely wasn't shadowed by anyone and was almost never double-teamed, though there were a couple of routes where a safety was in proximity. It could have had more to do with the Texans attacking the middle of the field against the Falcons' zone coverage.\nSAINTS: Have played the fifth-fewest snaps of zone coverage this season and have ignored tendencies some quarterbacks have had through the early portion of the season. It's just what they like to do. Stud cornerback Marshon Lattimore has not followed receivers much this season, playing 87% of his snaps at right cornerback (to the left of the quarterback). Their other primary outside corner, Paulson Adebo, has allowed a 50% catch rate on the season with minimal YAC.\nCOLLINS: It's minor but Collins does see a higher target per route run rate against man coverage (25%) than zone (22.2%). He also has a higher catch rate (87.5%) and higher receiving average (23.3) against man than zone (65.4% and 17.8). However, he's run nearly four times as many routes against zone coverage compared to man.\nMATCHUPS: It's also worth pointing out that Collins' two really big games came in Week 2 (vs. Indianapolis) and Week 4 (vs. Pittsburgh), both teams that rank in the bottom-10 in Fantasy points allowed to wide receivers. The Saints are in the top half.\nSTROUD: Has been outstanding against man coverage all year, completing a higher rate of passes (67.6%) for 3.5 more yards per attempt (11.1) than versus zone (7.6). However, he is nowhere near as impressive when he's pressured, completing 48.1% of his throws for a weak 4.3 yards per attempt.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Brock Purdy QB SF San Francisco \u2022 #13\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs.

The Cowboys wound up paying the price through the air for playing a ton of zone coverage instead. It was suggested by a friend that they didn't want to get burned by long runs by Christian McCaffrey. I guess that worked. The combination of the 49ers defense running hot and the Browns offense figuring to get stuffed should make for at least a game script for Purdy to have decent numbers. I'm not making the mistake again of benching Purdy -- I'd start him over Trevor Lawrence, Geno Smith and Jared Goff.\nLAST WEEK: Took on one of the toughest pass rushes in football and slayed them for four touchdowns on just 24 pass attempts. Of his seven incompletions, one was dropped, two were batted at the line of scrimmage, another was a throwaway and two more were defensed. Purdy was off-target on 0.0% of his throws.\nFANTASY: Has hit at least 20 Fantasy points in 9 of his 10 regular-season starts, and it really should be 10 for 10 because of a touchdown that was ruled a lateral back in Week 2. If you include the two playoff games he completed, Purdy has delivered at least 20 in 10 of 12 games. And in six of those 10 he hit at least 23 Fantasy points including each of his past three games.\nBROWNS: Have played the least amount of zone coverage snaps of any team in football this season, and they've done it consistently. There isn't a game this season where they've played even 65% of zone coverage snaps, and there have been only three quarters when they've called more than 70% of their snaps in zone coverage. Plus the Browns just saw the Cowboys play 90% of their snaps in zone coverage and Purdy cooked them like BBQ chicken.\nPURDY: Has been sensational against both man and zone coverages this season. His completion rate and yards per attempt are noticeably higher against zone, but five of his seven passing touchdowns have come versus man coverage. However, Purdy's been at his worst when pressured (like most quarterbacks), completing 50% of his throws for 6.7 yards per attempt with a gaudy 15.9% off-target rate. These stats are actually better than they were last week.\nBROWNS: Rank third in pass rush pressure rate at 41.5% and blitz at an above-average 29.3% rate. Granted, the Cowboys ranked higher than that last week and got beat anyway.\nLAMAR JACKSON: Faced the Browns in their last game, saw a ton of man coverage and was pressured a bunch and he still threw two touchdowns and completed 79% of his throws for 9.8 yards per attempt. And he did it without his starting left tackle and two of his top receivers. His defense turning over an ill-prepared Browns offense helped a bunch.\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jerome Ford RB CLE Cleveland \u2022 #34\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs.

In PPR you can hope for another game with five catches, which honestly isn't a stretch since he just had one against a good defense two games ago. Maybe he's good enough to start as an end-of-the-barrel RB2, but I'd feel better going with Rachaad White, Alexander Mattison or D'Onta Foreman.\nSINCE CHUBB GOT HURT: Ford has averaged 4.3 yards per rush and 7.7 yards per catch with three total touchdowns (including the catch he had on the play after the Chubb injury). His 69-yard cross-field run at Pittsburgh has certainly helped his numbers out; without it he has zero touches of 20-plus yards and his only run for more than 10 yards came with a holding penalty.\nSNAPS: Ford has yet to dominate snaps at running back for the Browns, playing right around 60% in Weeks 3 and 4. In fact, Ford does not have more than 14 touches in a single game since taking over for Chubb, but it's been just two games.\nHERE COME THE 49ERS: On the year they've held enemy running backs to 3.7 yards per carry with an explosive run rate of 1.7% (which somehow is only second-best in football). The only rush defense metrics they're not top-five in are Defensive Rush EPA (just below league average), yards before contact per rush (0.88 yards, they're sixth), yards after contact per rush (2.80, just above league average). They even lead the NFL in fewest missed tackles. Tony Pollard had an 8-29-0 rushing stat line against them last week.\nWHAT ABOUT THROUGH THE AIR? Even though the 49ers see the fifth-most RB targets per game, they're better than league average in catch rate allowed (75%) and top-10 in both yards per catch (5.7) and YAC\/reception (6.10) allowed to running backs. Pollard caught 4 of 5 passes for 35 yards last week.\nP.J. WALKER: Has thrown 17.2% of his career pass attempts to running backs. For 2023, the NFL league average of QB throws to running backs is 18.2%, so he's just below the current league average.\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Amari Cooper WR CLE Cleveland \u2022 #2\nAge: 29 \u2022 Experience: 9 yrs. If you start Cooper, you should not only have lower expectations but basically pray to the Fantasy Gods for some garbage production or ludicrous target volume. It's hard to trust Cooper to come through for a reliable stat line, and there's a lot of downside for a single-digit-point week. He's at best a low-end No. 3 receiver; I'd rather start Tyler Lockett, Chris Godwin or Drake London.\nLAST GAME: With rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson at quarterback, Cooper saw six targets and caught one for 16 yards. Half of the six targets were uncatchable. In his previous three with Deshaun Watson he had at least seven targets in each, and at least 16 PPR points in the past two.\nSINCE THEN: Watson hasn't practiced with the team. P.J. Walker was named the starter despite being on the team's practice squad and took reps this week in preparation for their game against the Niners.\nWALKER: Was cut by the Bears after the preseason before linking up with Cleveland. Has five career passing touchdowns in 15 games (seven starts). He's had multiple passing scores in one NFL game. Only twice has a receiver had 100 yards from Walker (both by D.J. Moore, once in 2020, once in 2022). Two other times has a WR had at least 70 yards (Curtis Samuel in 2020, Terrace Marshall in 2022). In his NFL career, Walker has thrown specifically to wide receivers on 71.2% of his throws, which basically the only good thing you can take away from this paragraph.\nCOOPER: In effectively 30 career games without Dak Prescott, Derek Carr or Deshaun Watson on the field (meaning he played with a backup), Cooper has 13 touchdowns (seven from Brissett) and seven with 100-plus yards (four with Brissett). More importantly, Cooper had at least 15 PPR points in 13 of the 30 games (six with Brissett), so 43% of the time.\nBRISSETT VS WALKER: Comparing their play over the past four seasons, Brissett had a considerably higher completion rate (63% to 57.5%) with a lower interception rate (1.7% to 4.8%) and lower off-target rate (10.3% to 18.9%). Brissett didn't throw downfield as much as Walker, contributing to a higher ADOT for Walker, but not by much (8.8 to 8.3). Both quarterbacks were right around 6.5 yards per pass attempt.\n49ERS: Oh yeah, the matchup isn't great. No team allows fewer yards per catch to wideouts than the Niners (9.7), and they're thrown at a ton by offenses that have to play from behind. Only three receivers -- Puka Nacua (20 targets), Marquise Brown (10 targets) and Michael Wilson (two touchdowns) have had more than 15 PPR points against them. And only one other receiver -- Tutu Atwell (nine target) -- had more than 12 PPR points.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Rhamondre Stevenson RB NE New England \u2022 #38\nAge: 25 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

Some might say dumping Elliott and giving more work to Stevenson would make sense, but Elliott actually has a higher rushing average and better before\/after contact rates than Stevenson does! Maybe the Patriots will turn to another running back in hopes of finding anything that can help take pressure off of their depleted passing game. I can't recommend Stevenson as a start until we see proof of him playing well -- a favorable road matchup alone isn't enough. I'd rather start Jerome Ford, Zack Moss and D'Onta Foreman.\nLAST WEEK: Was the first time Stevenson did not have 16 or more touches in a game. He had eight carries and no receptions. He also played a season-low 50% of the snaps but did handle 10 of 16 snaps on third\/fourth downs. Stevenson started and played the first two series, then Elliott started off the next two series, but they rotated in and out for each other the whole game. Elliott continued to be the Patriots RB of choice in the two-minute offense to end the first half.\nSTEVENSON: Nothing has changed in terms of his efficiency. We can blame the offensive line to some degree but Stevenson has averaged 0.97 yards before contact per rush this season. That ranks 30th out of 41 qualifying running backs. And if you think that's bad then consider his yards after contact per rush average of 1.79, which is dead last among those same 41 qualifiers.\nEXPLOSIVE RUNS: Stevenson has one (1) explosive carry of 12 or more yards. It was against Miami. It went 12 yards. This is a big change from 2022 when he had 21 explosive runs and an explosive run rate of 10%, which was eighth-best.\nRECEIVING: Is averaging 3.6 targets per game and catching 67% of them but is getting just 7.3 yards per catch and has one (1) explosive catch of 16 or more yards. That one went for 32 yards against the Eagles in Week 1. Since then his longest reception has been for seven yards.\nPATRIOTS: Have run one (1) play inside the opponents' five-yard line this entire season. That should help explain the lack of touchdowns for Stevenson.\nRAIDERS: Rank in the bottom 10 versus RBs in yards per carry allowed (4.3) and yards after contact per rush allowed (3.04). But they're also in the top-10 in most rush attempts by RBs faced (24.4 per game) and they've given up just three rushing touchdowns and an explosive run on 4.9% of their snaps (that's actually 10th best). And would you believe only one running back has scored more than 15 PPR points against the Raiders this season? It's James Cook.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Emari Demercado RB ARI Arizona \u2022 #31\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ LAR LAR -7 O\/U 48.5 OPP VS RB 10th PROJ PTS 11.6 RB RNK 20th YTD Stats RUYDS 48 REC 6 REYDS 40 TD 1 FPTS\/G 4.2 A likely split of work with Ingram could not only cost Demercado some carries, but Ingram's big size (6-0, 220) could put him at the goal line if the Cardinals can somehow get there. Think of Demercado as a candidate for 10 PPR points and perhaps four non-PPR points. I'd rather start both Colts RBs, Javonte Williams and Chuba Hubbard if Miles Sanders is out.\nLAST WEEK: After James Conner left with an injury, Demercado played 100% of the Cardinals snaps. They could have used veteran RB Corey Clement to help him out but kept him on special-teams duty. And Demercado actually played fairly well, flashing solid speed and physicality on his runs with some patience blended in. He's not as big as Conner but he played kind of like him.\nTHIS WEEK: Arizona released a depth chart with second-year back Keaontay Ingram as the first stringer. It is expected that Ingram will work with Demercado in the Cardinals backfield this week.\nINGRAM: Through 15 regular-season games over two years, Ingram has averaged 1.9 rush yards per carry. His career-long run is 13 yards. This past preseason Ingram did rock for 4.4 yards per run but no carry went more than 11 yards. His 2022 preseason wasn't better than his 2023 preseason.\nTHIRD DOWNS: Demercado has worked as the Cardinals third-down guy since Week 2, playing 74% of those snaps. He's also had some reps in their two-minute offense. It's not a stretch to say he's been Arizona's passing downs RB. That should remain as part of his role moving forward. But honestly, unless Ingram gets a hot hand early, Demercado should be given a chance to work running downs too.\nRAMS: Have taken a step forward as a decent run defense. In their past three games, they're holding running backs to 3.6 yards per carry and are better than league average in yards before and after contact as well as in missed tackles. A rival running back has 13-plus PPR points in three of their past four games, but each of those backs had at least 20 touches. No one looks like even a 12-touch back for the Cardinals.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jared Goff QB DET Detroit \u2022 #16\nAge: 29 \u2022 Experience: 8 yrs.

But the Buccaneers defense deserves some credit for holding up against their opponents. Plus, Goff's two big games came against bad secondaries and suspect pass rushes. This one is a little tougher. I think Goff is good enough to start ahead of Trevor Lawrence, Sam Howell and Geno Smith, but I would put Matthew Stafford and Brock Purdy ahead of him.\nLAST WEEK: Even without two of his most explosive targets, Goff exploited the Panthers defense for 236 yards and four total touchdowns on 28 pass attempts. And in the one specific area where you might have thought David Montgomery would have gotten the ball -- inside the 5 -- Goff threw two of his scores and dove for another.\nBUCCANEERS: Have been zone-heavy in three games but went man-to-man in an attempt to get back into their game against the Eagles in Week 3 and couldn't help their cause. That's their only loss on the season. The Bucs also blitz at the third-highest rate in football (41%) but even so they don't get a ton of pass rush pressure on the quarterback.\nGOFF: Has proven to be a little bit better against man coverage than zone this season, but his stats against both coverages are just fine (his QB rating against both are over 105 each). He has a better TD rate and attacks downfield a little more when he sees zone coverage. As for when he's blitzed, Goff's completion rate is sensational either way (over 68%) but naturally he has better numbers when he is not blitzed. The difference is noticeable but not detrimental.\nROAD WOES: I have to bring it up even though I don't like bringing it up -- since arriving in Detroit, Goff has topped 20 Fantasy points (six points per passing touchdown) twice in 16 road games.\nBUCCANEERS: Only one quarterback, Jalen Hurts, has posted over 20 Fantasy points this season on the Bucs. And only one quarterback, Kirk Cousins (on 44 attempts) threw two touchdowns against them.\nIf the game were in Detroit I wouldn't hesitate to call Goff a must-start. But the Buccaneers defense deserves some credit for holding up against their opponents. Plus, Goff's two big games came against bad secondaries and suspect pass rushes. This one is a little tougher.

If he couldn't put up a monster game against the Broncos, it's a tough sell that he'll do so against the Eagles. I do think volume will be in his favor, so counting on him for close to 16 PPR points (half that in non-PPR) is fair. That gives him flex appeal over Nico Collins and Tyler Lockett, but not over Jakobi Meyers, Zay Flowers or Gabe Davis.\nLAST WEEK: Coming off the heels of what felt like a step in the right direction, Wilson couldn't take advantage of a favorable matchup against the Broncos. He led the Jets in targets (seven) but was second behind Tyler Conklin in catches and yards. Wilson's 26.9% target share was a season low. Getting shadowed by Patrick Surtain on all but one of his targets didn't help, nor did having a pass bounce off his hands within five yards of the end zone.\nZACH WILSON: Was off-target on 15.4% of his throws for the second consecutive week even though he had a higher completion rate (73.1%) and passing yard average (7.7 yards per attempt). It's a byproduct of Wilson attempting just 26 throws after putting the ball up 39 times the game before.\nUNCATCHABLE: Of the 43 targets Garrett Wilson has seen from Zach Wilson, 14 of them (33%) have been uncatchable.\nEAGLES: Have let up a slew of receiving numbers by virtue of seeing so many passes thrown against them (27.4 targets per game just to wide receivers). So naturally they rank in the bottom five in catches allowed, YAC allowed and touchdowns allowed. But on per-target metrics they're doing all right. A 60.6% completion rate allowed is 10th-best, 11.4 yards per catch allowed is seventh-best and 4.06 YAC\/reception is on par with the league average.\nPASS RUSH: As overworked as the Eagles secondary has been, their pass rush has been solid. Against soft O-lines in Washington and L.A., the Eagles have put pressure on at a rate of 37.6% and have blitzed 33.3% of snaps. Given the state of the Jets offensive line after losing guard Alijah Vera-Tucker to a season-ending injury, it wouldn't be a surprise if the Eagles were to spook Zach Wilson frequently, leading to shorter throws, off-target throws and sacks.\nLET'S DO MATH: If the Jets are forced to throw much more than they did last week, say it's 39 times, then roughly 30% of those targets will go to Garrett Wilson. That's 12 targets. That's great. But of those 12, one-third figure to be uncatchable, meaning that we're looking at eight receptions at best for Wilson. And even though Wilson is averaging 8.7 yards per catch on the season, he deserves the benefit of at least 10.0 yards per catch since the Eagles are allowing 11.4 yards per catch to receivers. So maybe he can deliver just past 15 PPR points. Not too shabby.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Darren Waller TE NYG N.Y.

That includes the Bills, who could easily drape a second defender near him to force the Giants quarterback (whoever it is) to throw elsewhere. Waller is a low-end starter in the same range as Kyle Pitts and Cole Kmet -- and only ahead of them because of the volume we're hoping he gets.\nLAST WEEK: Waller was a focal point of the Giants offense and caught 8 of 11 targets for 86 yards at Miami. Four of the targets came from Tyrod Taylor (for 3-31-0), all in the fourth quarter. That was a 33% target share just from Taylor. And Waller could have had a bigger game as he was close to corralling some deep targets from Daniel Jones.\nTAYLOR: Has a career target rate of 22.4% to his tight ends, which is real nice. As recently as 2020 he leaned on Hunter Henry while with the Chargers, and even in two of his hey-day years with the Bills did he work tightly with Charles Clay. He shouldn't be a detriment.\nTHIS SEASON: Waller has the highest target share on the G-Men, but it's 20.8%. His ADOT also sits at 8.9, and both that number and the target share got lifted up by the Giants' decision to force-feed targets to Waller last week. He also ran more downfield routes than we're used to seeing. If the Giants stick with this then Waller can meet some of his lofty expectations. But I think if Brian Daboll had it his way he'd try to find explosive plays from all of his receivers and spread the ball around.\nBILLS: Got their first test against tight ends last week in Evan Engram and swarmed him -- he caught 4 of 8 targets for 28 yards. He is used similarly to Waller, which makes Buffalo's game plan for slowing Waller down easy to carry over this week. Their pass rush should also impact the Giants passing game and may force Waller to run shorter routes so he gets open quicker.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Dak Prescott QB DAL Dallas \u2022 #4\nAge: 30 \u2022 Experience: 8 yrs.

The Cowboys might pivot to a slower approach with Tony Pollard handling the run game more than he has been over the past couple of games. That could take pressure off of Prescott, but it doesn't mean he'll unload statistically. I'd rather start Sam Howell, Jared Goff and Matthew Stafford.\nLAST WEEK: A nightmare scenario as Prescott tried to get aggressive on downfield throws early and missed until he hit KaVontae Turpin for a 26-yard touchdown. Then Prescott HAD to throw deep to try and climb back into the game and got sloppy on two of his interceptions (a third bounced off of Michael Gallup's hands). He didn't even play the last 12 minutes of the game and the Cowboys got blown out.\nTHIS SEASON: Prescott's completion rate is fine (69.4%) and his off-target rate is low (8.1%). So what's the problem? Prescott's ADOT is 6.5, ranking 28th among 33 qualifying quarterbacks. He's actually second-to-last in pass attempts of 10-plus Air Yards; only Daniel Jones has thrown fewer. And the scary part is that his ADOT was over a yard lower (5.4) going into last week's game, so the Cowboys tried to let him air it out and the plan completely backfired.\nO-LINE: It's possible that injuries that go as far back as to Week 2 along with some declining play from Tyler Biadasz and Terence Steele could be contributing factors for Prescott's low ADOT. He doesn't want to get hit, so he's getting the ball out as fast as he can. Even against the 49ers he sped up his motion and overshot those targets. He's just not as comfortable and the offense isn't adjusting well enough.\nCHARGERS: Traditionally play a good amount of zone coverage but have changed it up more often this season and used more man-to-man, including versus Miami in Week 1. But despite some headliners in the front seven and 16 sacks in their past three games, the Chargers rank fourth-worst in pass rush pressure rate at 29.5% this season. They also blitz at about the league average rate. In theory this should not be a difficult matchup for Prescott, but\nKELLEN MOORE: Prescott's QB coach and\/or playcaller for the prior five seasons will be coaching the Chargers offense on Sunday, but he's sure to have spilled the beans on Prescott's tendencies. We've seen offensive coordinators come back to wreck their old teams all the time and could see it again on Sunday.\nFANTASY: The only quarterback to not get at least 22 Fantasy points against the Chargers was Raiders rookie Aidan O'Connell.\n\nThis article, authored by Dave Richard, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-10-12 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":149}

The 49ers spent an offseason chirping at the Birds \u2013 Samuel called one Eagles cornerback \u201ctrash\u201d \u2013 and then entered the Linc as a rare betting favorite against a 10-win team at home.\nThe Eagles (10-2) suffered a scare when Hurts jogged off the field in the fourth and went straight to the locker room. He was cleared to play and returned to action with about 10 minutes left. It was not immediately clear when Hurts was injured.\nBy the time last season\u2019s NFL MVP runner-up returned, the Eagles trailed 35-13 and were on their way toward their first home loss of the season. Hurts did hit DeVonta Smith for a two-yard TD on his return drive. He finished 26-of-45 passing for 298 yards. Purdy put the finishing touches on the win with a 46-yard TD to Samuel.\nPerhaps all that braggadocio paid off for the 49ers. Hard feelings spilled into the game, highlighted by a scrap in the third quarter that got 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw and the the Eagles\u2019 chief security officer tossed.\nDom DiSandro, a constant presence on the Eagles\u2019 sideline, pulled Greenlaw off Smith after a reception. Greenlaw popped up and reached over two officials to touch DiSandro\u2019s face with a closed fist. Greenlaw was ejected.

New England made a quarterback switch, benching Mac Jones in favor of Bailey Zappe. But the Patriots (2-10) still lost their fifth straight game. For the first time in franchise history, the Patriots have been shut out at home twice in a season. Zappe was sacked five times \u2013 two by Khalil Mack, giving him a career-high 15 for the season and 99 in his career. Zappe was 13 for 25 for 141 yards; he did avoid an interception for the first time in three games, the previous two in relief of Jones.\nTyreek Hill had two touchdowns among his 157 yards receiving to help the Miami Dolphins rout the Washington Commanders 45-15. The AFC East-leading Dolphins are 9-3 for the first time since 2001. Tua Tagovailoa was turnover-free after giving the ball away four times over the past two games. De\u2019Von Achane ran for two touchdowns in his return after missing five of the past six with a knee injury. The Commanders have lost four in a row. Washington\u2019s Sam Howell threw a pick-6 for a third consecutive game.\nDetroit Lions 33\u201328 New Orleans Saints\nSam LaPorta had career highs of nine catches for 140 yards, including an early touchdown and a crucial first-down snag in the final minutes, and the Detroit Lions beat the reeling New Orleans Saints. Detroit improved to 9-3, their best record through 12 games since they went 10-2 in 1962. The Saints lost quarterback Derek Carr in the fourth quarter to back, shoulder and head injuries. Carr was hurt on a penalized hit by Bruce Irvin. New Orleans fell to 5-7, behind first-place Atlanta in the NFC South.\nKansas City Chiefs 19-27 Green Bay Packers\nThe Green Bay Packers picked up their fourth win in five games as they beat the defending Super Bowl champions. The 6-6 Packers are now in the NFC wildcard places after Sunday night\u2019s win.\nDenver Broncos 17-22 Houston Texans\nNico Collins had a career-high 191 yards receiving and a fourth-quarter touchdown, and Jimmie Ward intercepted Denver\u2019s Russell Wilson in the end zone with nine seconds left to left to help the Houston (7-5) Texans hold on for a win over the Broncos. Ward leapt in front of intended receiver Lucas Krull to secure the fourth victory in five games for Houston and snap a five-game winning streak for Denver (6-6). Wilson was intercepted a season-high three times, all of them after halftime. Derek Stingley Jr had the first two picks for the Texans. Rookie CJ Stroud threw for 274 yards for Houston.\nIndianapolis Colts 31-28 Tennessee Titans\nGardner Minshew threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Michael Pittman with 2:31 left in overtime and the Indianapolis Colts (7-5) beat the Tennessee Titans (4-8) for their fourth straight victory. The Colts had to score a touchdown after Nick Folk made a 46-yard field goal with 4:19 left in overtime to put Tennessee up. Tennessee lost their first true home game this season and have yet to win consecutive games. The Titans blew a 17-7 lead. Nick Folk missed his first extra point this season with 5:26 left in regulation, which would have put Tennessee up 26-25.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Free weekly newsletter Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The AFC East-leading Dolphins are 9-3 for the first time since 2001. Tua Tagovailoa was turnover-free after giving the ball away four times over the past two games. De\u2019Von Achane ran for two touchdowns in his return after missing five of the past six with a knee injury. The Commanders have lost four in a row. Washington\u2019s Sam Howell threw a pick-six for a third consecutive game.\nAtlanta Falcons 13-8 New York Jets\nDesmond Ridder threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to MyCole Pruitt and the Atlanta Falcons took over sole possession of first place in the NFC South by slogging their way to an ugly victory over the punchless New York Jets.\nThe Falcons (6-6) have back-to-back wins for the first time since opening the season with victories over Carolina and Green Bay. Atlanta entered tied atop the division with New Orleans, who lost to Detroit.\nBut this game appealed only to fans of sloppy play, punting and penalty flags. The Jets (4-8) got an early safety but couldn\u2019t get anything going \u2013 again \u2013 on offense in losing their fifth straight game. New York even pulled quarterback Tim Boyle and replaced him with Trevor Siemian in the fourth quarter to try to provide a spark, but it was more of the same misery in what appeared a half-filled MetLife Stadium.\nCleveland Browns 19\u201336 Los Angeles Rams\nMatthew Stafford threw three touchdown passes, Puka Nacua became the first Rams rookie wide receiver to reach 1,000 yards in a season, and Los Angeles extended their winning streak to three games. The Rams have won three straight for the first time since winning the Super Bowl after the 2021 season. At 6-6, they are back in the playoff race after dropping three straight before their bye week. Joe Flacco was 23 of 44 for 254 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in his Browns debut. Cleveland fell to 7-5 and occupy the final playoff spot in the AFC.\nArizona Cardinals 24\u201310 Pittsburgh Steelers\nJames Conner ran for 105 yards and a pair of touchdowns against his old team as the Arizona Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was the Cardinals\u2019 first win at Pittsburgh since 1969. Arizona took control late in the first half with a 99-yard touchdown drive that ended with a five-yard strike from Kyler Murray to Trey McBride. The Cardinals led the rest of the way, enduring a pair of lengthy delays due to severe weather. The Steelers lost starting quarterback Kenny Pickett to an ankle injury late in the first half and scored their only touchdown in garbage time.\nCarolina Panthers 18\u201321 Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nTampa Bay\u2019s Mike Evans scored on a 75-yard reception and joined Jerry Rice as the only players in NFL history to string together 10 consecutive seasons with 1,000-plus yards receiving. Evans finished with seven receptions for 162 yards, increasing his season totals to 61 catches for 1,012 yards and 10 touchdowns. Rice has the league record of 11 straight seasons with more than 1,000 yards receiving. The Bucs won for only the second time in the past eight games. Carolina scored late to pull within a field goal, but No 1 overall draft pick Bryce Young threw an interception to end any chance of coming from behind to win in the Panthers\u2019 debut under interim coach Chris Tabor.\n\nThis article, authored by Associated Press, was published by The Guardian on 2023-12-03 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":150}

League\n\nTessa Wullaert\u2019s brace fired Belgium to a dramatic 3-2 home win over England in League A1 of 2023-24 UEFA Women\u2019s Nations League.\nWullaert equalised for Belgium in first-half injury time before she took advantage of Georgia Stanway\u2019s handball to fire in a 85th minute winning penalty.\nLaura De Neve earlier had curled the hosts ahead in the ninth minute before a serious collision between Alex Greenwood and Jassina Blom halted play in the 18th minute. whilst quick-fire goals from Lucy Bronze and Fran Kirby after the restart saw England fight back to lead briefly.\nBelgium now sit second in the group ahead of England by one point but two points behind group leaders, Netherlands.\nEmbed from Getty Images\nHaving battled to a narrow home win last Friday (27 October), England began on the front foot in Leuven with a fourth minute free-kick cleared by Belgium\u2019s Nicky Evrard.\nBelgium however drew first blood in this Halloween encounter after Chloe Kelly was penalised for handball just outside of the box, which allowd De Neve to curl her ninth-minute free-kick straight into the near-top right corner beyond the reach of an outstretched Mary Earps.\nEngland struggled to mount a response as Belgium continued to soak up their pressure and hit them on the counter attack, until Greenwood and Blom banged heads in the 18th minute as they tried to meet an aerial pass.\nThe impact of their clash of heads resulted in both players falling to ground which necessitated a 13-minute delay for medical treatment, with Blom eventually able to continue after concussion checks whilst Greenwood was stretchered off.\nEngland tweeted at half-time that Greenwood was concious and talking to medical staff under observation.\nAlex Greenwood is conscious and talking, and is being monitored by our medical staff. \u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Lionesses (@Lionesses) October 31, 2023\nThat lengthy delay reignited England\u2019s intensity which paid off as Lucy Bronze drew a 36th minute foul from Marie Detruyer, from which she headed in from Kelly\u2019s subsequent free-kick two minutes later to restore parity.\nKelly then fired wide in 41st minute as Belgium were forced to substiute De Neves due to injury, which unsettled their defence.\nThat change further motivated England whilst Belgium\u2019s defence were adjusting to the enforced change, as Bronze\u2019s header a minute later from Keira Walsh\u2019s cross was fired wide on the rebound by Alessia Russo.\nEngland continued to press and got their reward in the 44th minute as Lauren Hemp was unleashed up the left flank by Walsh, which allowed her to find Kirby on the pullback to rifle in beyond Evrard to turn the tie around.\nEngland\u2019s lead however only lasted seven minutes into 14 minutes of first-half injury time, as Wullaert was played through on the counter-attack by Janice Cayman to slot into the far left corner to pull Belgium level at the break.\nUpon the second-half start, Kirby quickly drew a foul from Kassandra Missipo but Russo fumbled control from Kelly\u2019s free-kick and her shot was blocked as England attempted to reclaim the lead.\nEvrard then saved Kirby\u2019s shot from Bronze\u2019s pullback pass in the 52nd minute as England continued to test the Red Flames\u2019 defence.\nEngland however were given an almighty scare just past the hour mark as Wullaert pounced upon a through ball and side-stepped both Jess Carter and Millie Bright, yet Earps crucially blocked her shot with a stunning save to keep the score level.\nBelgium however were forced to defend for much of the last half-hour as Russo and Georgia Stanway saw shots denied, whilst substitute \u2013 Rachel Daly nodded wide in the 80th minute from Walsh\u2019s deep corner towards the left post.\nSarina Wiegman\u2019s Lionesses were eventually made to pay for their wasted chances as Stanway handballed Daniels\u2019 83rd minute spot, which led referee \u2013 Esther Staubli to award a penalty to the hosts.\nWullaert stepped up and fired the penalty into the bottom-left corner to put Belgium in front, despite Earps diving the correct way to try and make the save.\nBelgium eventually clung on for victory which put them second in the group ahead of England and two points behind Netherlands, with their two rivals set to meet on 1 December in a blockbuster showdown.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nBelgium will meet Scotland on Friday 1 December at Den Dreef, Leuven in a 8:30pm CET (7:30pm) kick-off, with the Belgian Red Flames knowing that a win would put their fate in their own hands heading into their final group match away to the Netherlands.\nEngland meanwhile host Netherlands that same evening at Wembley Stadium, London, in a 7:45pm GMT kick-off, with the Lionesses needing to

{"title":"Salah seals emphatic Europa League win for Liverpool against Toulouse","context":"## Salah seals emphatic Europa League win for Liverpool against Toulouse\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s prediction that Liverpool would not \u201cfly\u201d through the Europa League group stage amounts to their only mis-step so far. Qualification for the knockout phase is already close at hand with the procession continuing against Toulouse.\nKlopp could ring the changes before Nottingham Forest\u2019s Premier League visit on Sunday, give a full debut to 19-year-old left-back Luke Chambers, first Liverpool outings to Calum Scanlon and James McConnell, and still enjoy a fluent, dominant display. It was polished by goals from Diogo Jota, Wataru Endo, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, the highly impressive Ryan Gravenberch and Mohamed Salah. Salah\u2019s strike with the final kick of the game was his 43rd European goal for Liverpool and took him above Thierry Henry as the most prolific goalscorer for an English club in European competition.\n\u201cI think I said it before \u2013 it is really easy to fall in love with this team, there is so much excitement,\u201d said the Liverpool manager after a seventh win in seven home matches this season. \u201cWe have to make massive steps, we have to grow, but a lot of signs are really positive and how the team interacts with each other is really nice.\u201d\nRivalry was forgotten and friendship remembered as Liverpool paid a warm tribute before kick-off to Bill Kenwright, the Everton chairman who died on Monday. The Hollies\u2019 He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother \u2013 the song Kenwright chose for a Hillsborough tribute at Goodison Park and became a fund-raising single for the justice campaign \u2013 was played to mass applause from the Liverpool fans inside Anfield. Kenwright\u2019s powerful speech at the Hillsborough memorial service in 2013 and lasting support for the bereaved families will not be forgotten across Stanley Park.\nLiverpool have won all three group games with something to spare, underlining why they are favourites for this season\u2019s competition, but the visit of French Cup winners Toulouse proved the most entertaining contest so far. Granted, Toulouse\u2019s terrible defending was a contributory factor but so too was the marauding midfield play of Gravenberch and Liverpool\u2019s quality in front of goal.\nThe hosts swept into an early lead when Jota collected a Joe Gomez interception, spun away from Cristian C\u00e1sseres and Niklas Schmidt, breezed past a nonexistent challenge from Logan Costa and beat goalkeeper Guillaume Restes with a confident finish.\nDiogo Jota slots the ball past Guillaume Restes to give Liverpool an early lead at Anfield. Photograph: David Blunsden\/Action Plus\/Shutterstock\nThe travelling Toulouse contingent were in uproar as their side stunned Anfield with a fine equaliser. Aron D\u00f8nnum dissected the Liverpool defence with a first time ball to Thijs Dallinga, who kept his cool on the long run towards Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher\u2019s goal and drilled his shot beyond the stand-in keeper.\nMore pedestrian defending allowed Liverpool to regain the lead via the first goal of Endo\u2019s Anfield career. Harvey Elliott played a short corner to Curtis Jones, he found Trent Alexander-Arnold, and the Japan international guided the captain\u2019s cross beyond the Toulouse keeper with a precise header. The towering Moussa Diarra epitomised Toulouse\u2019s defending around the goal by standing back to admire Endo as he headed home.\nQuick Guide Europa Conference League: Villa and Faroe Islanders soar Show Ollie Watkins continued his red-hot form as Aston Villa cruised to a statement 4-1 win at AZ Alkmaar in the Europa Conference League. The striker netted his 10th goal of the season and fourth in Europe this season on Thursday. Leon Bailey and Youri Tielemans \u2013 his first for Villa \u2013 put them in control in AZ Stadium after less than 25 minutes. Vangelis Pavlidis wasted the hosts' best chances but Watkins and John McGinn added more goals after the break in the Netherlands before Ibrahim Sadiq grabbed a consolation. It was the second time in two games Villa had scored four after their 4-1 Premier League win over West Ham on Sunday. Ki Klaksvik became the first Faroe Islands club to win in the group stages of a European competition with a stunning 3-0 success againt Olimpija Ljubljana. Rene Joensen, Pall Klettskard and Jakup Andreasen were the heroes at at the 6,500 capacity Torsvollur national stadium. Aberdeen's hopes of navigating a route through the Conference League group stage suffered a major blow as they threw away a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 against PAOK Salonika on a rollercoaster night at Pittodrie. Having weathered heavy pressure in a goalless first half, Barry Robson's men found themselves two goals to the good by the hour mark thanks to Bojan Miovski and Dante Polvara. But a stunning comeback saw the Greek side take three points after goals from substitutes Kiril Despodov and captain Vieirinha, and a stoppage-time penalty, awarded after a VAR check, from Stefan Schwab. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\nIt was soon three when Gravenberch surged through the Toulouse midfield and found Jones. The midfielder\u2019s shot was blocked by Mikkel Desler but rebounded off Jones into the path of N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who lashed a thumping finish into the roof of Restes\u2019 net.\nThe second half was memorable mainly for misses. Gabriel Suazo squandered a glorious chance to haul Toulouse back into the contest when Kelleher sliced a clearance into the path of Dallinga. The goalscorer squared for Suazo who had a free shot on a goal with only Alexander-Arnold standing in it. To his despair, he managed to find the defender\u2019s thigh.\nNot to be outdone, N\u00fa\u00f1ez failed to complete what should have been a stunning individual goal when he left Rasmus Nicolaisen floundering with a superb footwork and rounded the Toulouse goalkeeper. The Uruguay international struck a post instead of the open goal and was on his knees in disbelief when Gravenberch finished the job from the rebound. Salah came off the bench to end the rout and create yet more history when scoring off the underside of the bar.\n\nThis article, authored by Andy Hunter at Anfield, was published by The Guardian on 2023-10-26 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":152}
{"title":"Elon Musk\u2019s X faces first DSA probe in EU over illegal content risks, moderation, transparency and deceptive UX design","context":"## Elon Musk\u2019s X faces first DSA probe in EU over illegal content risks, moderation, transparency and deceptive UX design\n\nIt\u2019s official! Elon Musk\u2019s X marks the spot of the first confirmed investigation opened by the European Union under its rebooted digital rulebook, the Digital Services Act (DSA).\nAnnouncing the opening of a \u201cformal proceeding\u201d today, the European Commission said the investigation will look at whether the social networking platform may have breached rules linked to risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency and data access for researchers.\nThe opening of a formal DSA investigation on X comes hard on the heels of a complaint against X\u2019s adtech by privacy rights group, noyb \u2014 although today\u2019s formal proceeding is unlikely to be directly linked as the Commission has been probing the platform for months via a flurry of requests for information. Its earlier actions were focused on concerns about the spread of illegal content and disinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war.\nBack in October the Commission sent Musk\u2019s company an \u201curgent\u201d formal request for information about how it was responding to information risks arising out of the conflict. The EU also said then it was looking at X\u2019s compliance across a number of areas, including policies and practices regarding notices on illegal content, complaint handling, risk assessment and measures to mitigate the risks identified \u2014 and it gave X until the end of October to respond.\n\u201cOn the basis of the preliminary investigation conducted so far, including on the basis of an analysis of the risk assessment report submitted by X in September, X\u2019s Transparency report published on 3 November, and X\u2019s replies to a formal request for information, which, among others, concerned the dissemination of illegal content in the context of Hamas\u2019 terrorist attacks against Israel, the Commission has decided to open formal infringement proceedings against X under the Digital Services Act,\u201d the EU said today.\nPer the Commission, the EU\u2019s investigation of X focuses on the following areas and issues:\nCompliance with DSA obligations related to countering the dissemination of illegal content in the EU \u2014 \u201c notably in relation to the risk assessment and mitigation measures adopted by X to counter the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, as well as the functioning of the notice and action mechanism for illegal content in the EU mandated by the DSA, including in light of X\u2019s content moderation resources\n\u2014 \u201c The effectiveness of measures taken by X to combat info manipulation \u2014 with a focus on the effectiveness of its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d system of crowdsourcing fact-checking to aggregated views of users, who may vote to label disputed tweets with additional context. The EU said the probe will also look at the effectiveness of \u201crelated policies mitigating risks to civic discourse and electoral processes\u201d\n\u2014 with a focus on the effectiveness of its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d system of crowdsourcing fact-checking to aggregated views of users, who may vote to label disputed tweets with additional context. The EU said the probe will also look at the Transparency requirements \u2014 with a focus on \u201csuspected shortcomings\u201d by X in giving researchers access to publicly accessible data as mandated by Article 40 of the DSA, and suspected shortcomings in its ads repository (aka the ads transparency library the regulation also mandates)\n\u2014 with a focus on \u201csuspected shortcomings\u201d by X in giving researchers access to publicly accessible data as mandated by Article 40 of the DSA, and suspected shortcomings in its ads repository (aka the ads transparency library the regulation also mandates) Suspected deceptive design elements in X\u2019s user interface \u2014 \u201cnotably in relation to checkmarks linked to certain subscription products, the so-called Blue checks\u201d\n\u201cIf proven, these failures would constitute infringements of Articles 34(1), 34(2) and 35(1), 16(5) and 16(6), 25(1), 39 and 40(12) of the DSA,\u201d the EU added \u2014 saying it will now carry out an in-depth investigation \u201cas a matter of priority\u201d.\nToday we open formal infringement proceedings against @X : \u26a0\ufe0f Suspected breach of obligations to counter #IllegalContent and #Disinformation \u26a0\ufe0f Suspected breach of #Transparency obligations \u26a0\ufe0f Suspected #DeceptiveDesign of user interface#DSA pic.twitter.com\/NxKIif603k \u2014 Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) December 18, 2023\nThe Commission is responsible for enforcing the DSA on larger platforms such as X \u2014 which was designated a very large online platform (VLOP) under the DSA back in April. Confirmed breaches of the online governance regime can face a range of major sanctions, including fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.\nThe EU can also apply interim measures where it believes there\u2019s a risk of serious harm for users and may even seek to have access to infringing services temporarily blocked. Although its announcement today is careful to caveat the development by affirming no conclusions have yet been reached.\nThere is also no confirmed timeline for the probe to conclude. But the fact of it being opened means other tools are put within reach of regulators and could be applied if the EU sees the need to act quickly \u2014 such as the aforementioned interim measures. So the Commission\u2019s official scrutiny of X could have real world implications for how the platform operates sooner rather than later.\nReached for a response to the EU probe, X\u2019s Joe Benarroch \u2014 who was brought into the company by CEO Linda Yaccarino relatively recently to work on business operations \u2014 said:\nX remains committed to complying with the Digital Services Act, and is cooperating with the regulatory process. It is important that this process remains free of political influence and follows the law. X is focused on creating a safe and inclusive environment for all users on our platform, while protecting freedom of expression, and we will continue to work tirelessly towards this goal.\nWhile X under Musk has very evidently been flying the ship in the opposite direction to the responsible governance the DSA intends to encourage \u2014 hence attracting so many warnings from EU lawmakers, even long before today\u2019s formal probe \u2014 it\u2019s notable X recently started offering a research program for outsiders to get data to systemic risks arising on the platform in the EU. However the Commission obviously has doubts X has gone far enough on the transparency front to meet the DSA\u2019s bar.\nEU regulators are also set to assess Musk & co\u2019s claims that replacing a formal content moderation function with crowdsourced opinions is a valid approach to tackling diverse information risks; and, consequently, to look into how much Musk\u2019s gutting of content moderation teams and processes has cost X\u2019s users in terms of harm exposure.\nTo say the Commission\u2019s investigation looks fascinating and timely is an understatement.\nEU lawmakers can certainly bask in the glow of being prepared for the possibility of an erratic billionaire running a wrecking ball through a major social platform. But of course they will need to follow through \u2014 and it\u2019s clear the real work is just starting. So this probe looks set to be a test of how much stomach the EU has to actually enforce the rules it loves to lay down on paper.\nThe investigation may also test Musk\u2019s mettle for what could be an expensive head-on clash with EU regulators. Time will tell how this one plays out but he may find the dead blue bird he\u2019s chosen to hang around his neck, when he purposefully ripped up the standard content moderation rulebook and opted to channel online chaos, starting to feel like it\u2019s dragging him down.\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-18 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":153}
{"title":"The best shows to stream in December","context":"## The best shows to stream in December\n\nSave Log in , register or subscribe to save articles for later. Save articles for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The corporate and creative philosophy behind streaming television is in a state of flux, and now the cracks in the prevailing wisdom are starting to appear. Take, for instance, the value of exclusivity. For the past five or so years entertainment companies have been focused on creating their own streaming platforms, which would be built around exclusive control of their original content, whether it was original new series or a sister studio\u2019s Hollywood movies. But now that income is desired most, some streamers are once again willing to sell non-exclusive rights to others. In December, one of the best original shows on Paramount+, the compelling horror-laced drama Yellowjackets, will become available on Netflix (see below for my recommendation). Netflix gets a buzzy show the vast majority of its subscribers have never had access to, while Paramount+ earns a rights payment and broadens the audience for Yellowjackets, which has a third season commissioned. Streaming\u2019s walls are crumbling. That said, there are still plenty of promising new shows and movies, most of them exclusive to their services, debuting in December. Whether you\u2019re after an awards season blockbuster (Netflix\u2019s Maestro) or an Australian comic-drama (Binge\u2019s Strife), your watchlist should be well loaded. Netflix Bradley Cooper stars as legedary conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein in Maestro. Credit: Jason McDonald\/Netflix My top Netflix recommendation is Maestro (December 20). Not since Warren Beatty in the late 1970s has a Hollywood leading man so completely \u2013 perhaps obsessively \u2013 given themselves over to filmmaking as Bradley Cooper. The credit he banked from starring in the Hangover comedies, Silver Linings Playbook, and American Sniper let Cooper co-write, direct and star in the 2018 hit A Star is Born. He now fills the same three positions in another movie about a tormented musician: the superstar American conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein. Cooper bristles at the term biopic, and instead the film focuses on Bernstein\u2019s conducting, his nurturing marriage to Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan), and his parallel relationships with male lovers. There\u2019s no Shallow to be found here, but Cooper appears to inhabit Bernstein across decades and the film is primed for the Academy Awards.\nAdvertisement\nAlso on Netflix: Few shows recently have cast a spell as intense as Yellowjackets (December 15), a now-and-then horror thriller about a group of deeply divided 40-something women forced to confront the grim but unspoken reality of how they endured 18 months marooned in the Canadian wilderness as teenagers. With Juliette Lewis, Melanie Lynskey and Christina Ricci among the survivors, the story is a mix of supernatural menace, black comedy, teenage adversity, and deeply expressed trauma. It\u2019s coming to Netflix after two years on Paramount+ and it\u2019s a can\u2019t-look-away binge just waiting to happen. When the history of the high-concept Hollywood blockbuster is written, Zack Snyder\u2019s name will be prominent \u2013 for better or worse. Snyder is responsible for 300, Man of Steel, and most of Justice League, and having come to Netflix for the tepid zombie heist movie Army of the Dead he\u2019s doubling down with Rebel Moon: Part One \u2013 A Child of Fire (December 22). A two-part space opera \u2013 the sequel is scheduled for next April \u2013 that Snyder originally pitched as a Star Wars spin-off, it\u2019s a Seven Samurai-influenced epic about a former soldier, Kora (Atomic Blonde\u2019s Sofia Boutella), who recruits a group of mercenaries (Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou) to defend the farmers on a moon threatened by the galaxy\u2019s authoritarian ruler. Digital science-fiction spectacle is a given, but can Snyder deliver genuine emotional stakes? November highlights: David Fincher hit the mark with his assured hitman drama The Killer, documentary Last Stop Larrimah was a fascinating outback mystery, Robbie Williams was a star telling his own story, but prestige drama All the Light We Cannot See fell short. Binge Opal (BeBe Bettencourt), Christine (Maria Angelico), Jeeet (Olivia Junkeer), Penny (Bryony Skillington) and Evelyn (Asher Keddie) in Strife. Credit: Binge My top Binge recommendation is Strife (December 6). It\u2019s not a direct adaptation, but this new Australian comic-drama about a woman trying to keep up with her own life is based on Mia Freedman\u2019s 2017 memoir, Work Strife Balance. Asher Keddie, who has previously summed up the conflicting demands on professional women in Offspring and Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo, plays the fictional Evelyn Jones, a blogger who strikes a chord and becomes an online publisher and media commentator just as her marriage is coming apart. Evelyn keeps getting pulled in every direction, a situation that should be both comically rich and smartly telling in the hands of the show\u2019s creator, Sarah Scheller, who previously put together the terrific motherhood comedy The Letdown (currently on Netflix). The supporting cast includes Matt Day (Rake) and Jonathan LaPaglia (The Slap).\nAdvertisement\nAlso on Binge: I won\u2019t spoil it, but there was a nerve-shredding cliffhanger in the first season of Vigil (December 11) that I still think about far too often. That\u2019s a pretty strong indicator that this Scottish crime thriller, where a police detective was assigned to a murder investigation on board an on-duty British nuclear submarine, pushed the right buttons. The show\u2019s second season stays on dry land but retains the military focus: when an attack drone demonstration at a British army base goes tragically wrong, Detective Chief Inspector Amy Silva (Suranne Jones, Gentleman Jack) and her now pregnant partner, Detective Sergeant Kirsten Longacre (Rose Leslie, Game of Thrones), are called in to investigate. Expect a fast pace and significant twists \u2013 this series doesn\u2019t do quiet contemplation. November highlights: Comedy troupe Please Don\u2019t Destroy flew the flag for 20-somethings with The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, picaresque comedy Bookie made the right bet, and Julia continued the celebrity chef biography of Julia Child. Stan* Claudia Karvan and Nathalie Morris in the new season of Bump. Credit: Stan My top Stan recommendation is Bump (December 26). It\u2019s one of the best new traditions in Australian television: a new season of this tremendous Sydney-based comic-drama gets uploaded every Boxing Day. This is the fourth instalment of Kelsey Munro and Claudia Karvan\u2019s show and one of the strong points about it is that each iteration places its ensemble cast in a testing new light. The high-school students of season one, Oly (Nathalie Morris) and Santi (Carlos Sanson Jr), who were thrown together when a hook-up turned into a teenage pregnancy, are now a career woman and stay-at-home dad while their daughter, Jacinda (Ava Cannon), is in primary school. Bump tugs at the heartstrings, but with hard-earned understanding and a feel for the contrary demands of family. Please keep it coming. Also on Stan: Revealed: Ben Roberts-Smith Truth on Trial (December 10) is a feature-length documentary that provides the inside story to one of Australia\u2019s most contentious and headline-making pieces of investigative journalism: the five-year quest to unearth the truth behind rumours that the country\u2019s most decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, committed war crimes in Afghanistan. With stories in The Age and Sydney Morning Herald, as well as on 60 Minutes, journalists Nick McKenzie and Chris Masters pushed to bring the truth to the public, navigating divisions in the SAS and eventually the defamation trial that Roberts-Smith brought to court and lost. It\u2019s been a compelling saga, and Dora Weekley\u2019s documentary should include hitherto unknown details and unheard commentary.\nAdvertisement\nI still haven\u2019t got over the nightmarish sounds of a spinal surgery going very wrong in the first season, but nonetheless Dr Death (December 22) is back for a second serve of malpractice and monstrous medical egos. This American true crime drama is now an anthology. Every season is a different doctor whose abuse of privilege posed a criminal risk to their patients. The new season will cover Paolo Macchiarini, an Italian surgeon and researcher who was accused of laboratory fraud and manipulative behaviour. Fresh from Wolf Like Me, Edgar Ramirez plays Macchiarini, while Mandy Moore (This is Us) is Benita Alexander, the journalist who got dangerously close to the truth. November highlights: The final season of groundbreaking Canadian comedy Sort Of confirmed it as an under-the-radar gem, Scrublands was a tight Australian crime thriller, and science-fiction fans got a spin-off with Orphan Black: Echoes. Amazon Prime Alan Ritchson returns in Reacher. Credit: Amazon Prime My top Amazon Prime recommendation is Reacher (December 15). I am much heartened by the star of this American action series, Alan Ritchson, who decided that, despite looking like an absolute unit in the show\u2019s first season, he nonetheless needed to add even more muscle for these new episodes to convincingly depict Jack Reacher. Adapted from Lee Child\u2019s wildly successful novels about an off-the-grid former US military policeman \u2013 somehow the diminutive Tom Cruise played the role in a pair of movies \u2013 Reacher is an uncomplicated guy: he fixes wrongs with two fists and zero concerns. If anything, the first season was too subtle, so an even larger Reacher who drops deadpan one-liners while having access to a missile launcher seems promising. And I\u2019m taking the under for the proposition of whether a ripped Reacher sheds his shirt within three episodes. Also on Amazon Prime: Recommending Prisoner\u2019s Daughter (December 5) is a bet on talent. This domestic drama has a familiar outline, with an ageing and terminally ill criminal having his sentence commuted on the grounds that he lives with his estranged daughter, a single mother and Las Vegas waitress struggling to make ends meet and connect her son with a positive role model. Obviously, they\u2019re going to belatedly bond in the face of increasingly fraught difficulties, but how that plays out will be guided by the performances of Brian Cox (Succession) and Kate Beckinsale (Laurel Canyon) as father and daughter, and the direction of Catherine Hardwicke, who found something genuine in the first Twilight movie before being replaced for the sequels by a succession of ill-equipped male filmmakers.\nAdvertisement\nNovember highlights: The adult animated superhero drama Invincible returned with more cape fear, while the Bond franchise authorised a reality competition with 007: Road to a Million. Apple TV+ The Peanuts gang is back in The Snoopy Show - Happiness is Holiday Traditions. Credit: Apple TV+ My top Apple TV+ recommendation is The Snoopy Show: Happiness is Holiday Traditions (December 1). Just quietly, over the past two years Apple TV+ has been producing a nourishing stream of animated Snoopy content that is faithful to Charles M Schulz\u2019s beloved comic strip, Peanuts. The spotted white beagle and his adolescent cohort \u2013 Charlie Brown, Marcie, Peppermint Patty, and many more \u2013 have always transferred easily from a panel on the page to an animation frame, and this official adaptation has a trademark mix of wry humour, flights of fantasy, and heartwarming camaraderie. Happiness is Holiday Traditions is a bonus special to close off the third season of the series, and it will stay true to the rule that helps make Peanuts endure: no adults are seen or heard. Also on Apple TV+: The trailer for Family Plan (December 15), an action-comedy feature where Mark Wahlberg plays a former master assassin who left the trade and secretly built a new life in the American suburbs as a cheerful husband and father, is goofy as all heck. The question is whether it\u2019s ludicrous fun or just sappy shenanigans? Wahlberg\u2019s Dan Morgan, who has to go on a Las Vegas road trip with his blissfully unaware family after his cover is blown, dispatching goons while carrying his youngest in a BabyBjorn and stunt driving in a family minivan are positive signs. Michelle Monaghan (True Detective) plays Mrs Morgan, who quietly thinks her husband is a little vanilla, and the fine Irish actor Ciaran Hinds (There Will Be Blood) goes full villain. November highlights: The Buccaneers placed a modern teen lens on Edith Wharton\u2019s period marital drama, while Godzilla and pals returned for Monarchy: Legacy of Monsters and space race alternate history For All Mankind reached the 21st century.\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article, authored by Craig Mathieson, was published by The Sydney Morning Herald on 2023-11-30 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":154}
{"title":"After a Stunning Snub, College Football Is Facing an Identity Crisis","context":"## After a Stunning Snub, College Football Is Facing an Identity Crisis\n\nThis sport\u2019s identity crisis has existed since the inception of the College Football Playoff a decade ago, but never before have we had to come to terms with it the way we did on Sunday.\nThat identity crisis? Whether the teams that play for the national championship should be the best or the most deserving. In the nine years before this season, the best and most deserving seamlessly became one, resulting in cut-and-dried decisions on which teams would make the field.\nAdvertisement\nIn the final season of the four-team era \u2014 before it expands to 12 in 2024 \u2014 the CFP committee was charged with a very difficult decision that was guaranteed to result in a worthy team feeling cheated. The committee, for the first time, was actually going to have to choose what it values more \u2014 the teams that earned it or the teams that look the best on TV.\nFlorida State, the most deserving, became the first unbeaten Power 5 conference champion left out of the field. The Seminoles were the ones left feeling cheated.\nAnd with that one decision, the committee didn\u2019t just choose teams in a given year. It revealed to the world the ugly truth about college football \u2014 this sport is a beauty contest where decisions on which teams can win the national title are sometimes made as much in a cozy hotel boardroom in Grapevine, Texas, as they are on the actual field.\nThe Playoff field is as follows: 1. Michigan, 2. Washington, 3. Texas, 4. Alabama.\nMichigan and Washington made it through the season unscathed. Texas lost a nail-biter in its rivalry game to Oklahoma, and the Longhorns, wait for it, beat Alabama.\nWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion if Florida State\u2019s star quarterback, Jordan Travis, didn\u2019t break his leg two weeks ago. But the Seminoles team that just beat Louisville 16-6 in the ACC Championship Game was relying on a third-string quarterback. The win was far from impressive.\ndevastated. heartbroken. In so much disbelief rn, I wish my leg broke earlier in the season so y\u2019all could see this team is much more than the quarterback. I thought results matter. 13-0 and this roster matches up across any team in those top 4 rankings. I am so sorry. Go Noles! \u2014 Jordan Travis (@jordantrav13) December 3, 2023\nThe committee, knowing it was going to unjustly break someone\u2019s heart, decided to break Florida State\u2019s. In that room on Saturday night, the committee members decided the Seminoles weren\u2019t good enough for us.\nAdvertisement\nThat\u2019s not what sports are supposed to be about. And with the four-team CFP era ending after this season, fans will be viewing it as a broken system that needed to be changed rather than the first frontier of the modernization of the sport.\nIt\u2019s very easy to fathom why the committee couldn\u2019t choose between Alabama and Texas. Alabama is a one-loss SEC champion that beat Georgia on Saturday, ending the Bulldogs\u2019 29-game winning streak. Texas, a one-loss Big 12 champion, beat Alabama by 10 points in Tuscaloosa in September.\nMany fans were hoping that the SEC would be left out entirely for the first time, but the committee \u2014 charged with picking the \u201cbest teams\u201d \u2014 couldn\u2019t ignore what the ultra-talented Crimson Tide accomplished. But if Alabama goes, how could the committee leave the team out that beat it?\nIt couldn\u2019t.\nThis is probably the path of least resistance. Outside of Florida State fans, the general population will move on convinced that the Playoff semifinals will be more entertaining with more high-level teams. The best teams, as they say, won out.\nThe problem with choosing the best is that it\u2019s entirely subjective and ultimately misleading given this is a sport that routinely features unpredictable results and unforeseen runs. The last time a team was relying on a third-string quarterback heading into the College Football Playoff \u2014 Ohio State in the inaugural season of the four-team field \u2014 won the national title.\nThe difference between those Buckeyes and this Florida State team was that Ohio State won the Big Ten title game that year 59-0. Florida State was in a close game with Louisville that was, quite frankly, not an enjoyable watch for people who love the excitement of big-time offense. Perception, wrongly, became reality.\n\u201cFlorida State is a different team,\u201d CFP committee chair Boo Corrigan said after the field was revealed. \u201cYou look at who they are as a team without Jordan Travis \u2014 they are a different team.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat\u2019s a well-informed opinion that\u2019s probably true. It, however, is not a fact. You could make the case that Florida State is so good that it won a Power 5 conference championship game with a true freshman quarterback. In the CFP, Florida State would have gotten second-string quarterback Tate Rodemaker back with a month to prepare for a semifinal game.\nFlorida State was robbed.\nAnd its head coach didn\u2019t hide his disappointment.\n\u201cI am disgusted and infuriated with the committee\u2019s decision today to have what was earned on the field taken away because a small group of people decided they knew better than the results of the games,\u201d Mike Norvell said in a statement. \u201cWhat is the point of playing games?\u201d\nAs difficult as it would have been, the right thing for the committee to do would have been to leave Alabama out. Most of us know in our gut that the Crimson Tide \u2014 the most talented team, on paper, in the sport \u2014 are one of the four best teams. Alabama is certainly equipped to win the whole thing.\nBut Alabama \u2014 like peers Georgia and Ohio State, teams with a wealth of raw talent on their rosters \u2014 lost a game (at home). Better teams have been left out in the past than this Alabama team because losses had consequences.\nAlabama\u2019s loss to Texas didn\u2019t have a consequence because we\u2019re enamored with the SEC and what it means to beat Georgia. It didn\u2019t matter that Alabama \u2014 though perceived to be an entirely different team in September \u2014 lost to the Longhorns. That game could have been a Playoff game in September. It turns out it was an exhibition.\nThere are plenty of people who are against the expansion of the field to 12 because of the sanctity of the regular season. But if the games in the regular season aren\u2019t going to matter when it comes to picking the final four, then there are no consequences for expanding to 12.\nAdvertisement\nThe regular season didn\u2019t decide who made it this year. Thirteen people did.\nThe games mattered. The results didn\u2019t.\n(Photo of Mike Norvell: Isaiah Vazquez \/ Getty Images)\n\nThis article, authored by The New York Times, was published by The New York Times on 2023-12-03 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":155}
{"title":"Power struggle in one of Canada\u2019s wealthiest clans has sister accusing chairman brother of \u2018vendetta\u2019","context":"## Power struggle in one of Canada\u2019s wealthiest clans has sister accusing chairman brother of \u2018vendetta\u2019\n\nTwo members of the billionaire family that controls Rogers Communications Inc. are suing the company, saying they\u2019ve been frozen out of board meetings and blocked from getting information, reigniting a bitter power struggle within one of Canada\u2019s wealthiest clans.\nMelinda Rogers-Hixon says she\u2019s the target of a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d by her older brother, Rogers Chair Edward Rogers, according to a letter contained in the court filing. The Rogers siblings were close to an agreement that would have resolved their longstanding differences, but Edward Rogers reneged on it, according to the Sept. 20 missive by Rogers-Hixon, which was sent to Chief Executive Officer Tony Staffieri.\nThe court petition was filed by Rogers-Hixon and her sister, Martha Rogers, and it argues the company has been \u201coppressive\u201d to them.\nThe documents show that the fractures inside the prominent Toronto family have never healed. Rogers Communications is the country\u2019s largest wireless provider and the owner of a cable television empire, the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team and other media and sports assets. The family\u2019s controlling stake in the public company is worth close to C$8 billion ($5.9 billion), according to calculations based on company filings for its 2023 annual meeting.\nShares of Rogers extended losses on news of the lawsuit, closing down 2.2% to C$53.07 in Toronto. They\u2019ve dropped 16% this year.\nThe children of late founder Ted Rogers have frequently fought one another \u2014 sometimes driving down Rogers\u2019 stock price as investors grew worried about the company\u2019s governance.\nThe bad blood spilled into full view in October 2021, when Edward Rogers publicly battled his sisters and his mother for control of the board and won in court. The result was that five Rogers Communications directors were fired, replaced by five allies of Edward Rogers. Soon after, then-CEO Joe Natale was sacked and replaced by Staffieri, the former chief financial officer. Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers had opposed the CEO change.\nIn early 2022, family members agreed to temporarily shelve their disagreements, according to this week\u2019s court filing, to avoid negative publicity as the company sought regulators\u2019 approval for the takeover of Shaw Communications Inc. The C$20 billion transaction was the company\u2019s biggest deal ever and among the largest corporate transactions in Canadian history.\nNegotiations Collapse\nAs part of that truce, Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers agreed not to participate in board discussions about the Shaw deal or receive materials on it, because of an argument about Rogers-Hixon\u2019s personal lawyer, whose firm also does work for Telus Corp., a competitor to Rogers and Shaw.\nThe Shaw takeover finally closed on April 3 of this year, and the Rogers siblings engaged in talks \u201cintended to resolve all issues between us,\u201d Rogers-Hixon stated in an affidavit. \u201cI was hopeful all issues could be resolved without negative publicity.\u201d But those negotiations collapsed last month, she said.\nIt isn\u2019t clear from the court filings whether the discussions included the possibility that any Rogers family members would sell their stake in Rogers Communications, leave their roles at the company, or exit the family trust that controls almost all of the voting shares of the public company.\n\u201cThis matter should be resolved privately,\u201d Rogers Communications spokesperson Sarah Schmidt said by email. \u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated that we will not be distracted by these actions \u2014 we have significant momentum in the market, our merger is tracking ahead of plan, and we remain squarely focused on doing what\u2019s right for our customers and stakeholders.\u201d\nStill Excluded\nBoth Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers said in documents that they\u2019re still being excluded from some parts of board and committee meetings and are being given redacted board documents.\n\u201cI cannot properly perform my duties as a director if information that is provided to the rest of the directors is being withheld from me,\u201d Rogers-Hixon said in her affidavit. The two sisters are seeking a judge\u2019s order to force the company to share information with them and allow them to attend, in full, all meetings of the board, as well as board committees they belong to.\nRogers took \u201creasonable steps\u201d to protect company information from a competitor, Schmidt said. Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers could have resolved the matter by choosing a different lawyer, \u201cand they chose not to do so,\u201d she added.\nThe court filing also suggests that Rogers-Hixon was forced out of her role as a director of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the company that owns Toronto\u2019s professional hockey and basketball teams and in which Rogers Communications is a large minority investor.\nRogers\u2019 corporate governance committee is conducting an investigation of the events that took place in 2021, documents show. The committee has asked for copies of \u201call correspondence\u201d between Rogers-Hixon and former CEO Natale, three other former executives, the five ousted directors, Martha Rogers, journalists and others, according to a letter to Rogers-Hixon that\u2019s included with the court filing.\n\u201cThe investigation is intended to inform decisions that may be made about your status as a director of RCI,\u201d says the letter signed by Robert Gemmell, a former Citigroup Inc. banker who is Rogers\u2019 lead director.\nAlthough the company is controlled by a family trust, it\u2019s structured in a way that gives significant power to the trust\u2019s chair, in this case Edward Rogers, the only son of late founder Ted Rogers. That\u2019s what allowed him to reshape the board in 2021 over the opposition of family members.\nThe family dynamics have grown even more complicated in recent months because of the deaths of three key insiders. Loretta Rogers \u2014 the mother of Martha, Melinda, Edward and Lisa Rogers \u2014 died in June 2022. Alan Horn and Phil Lind, two longtime executives who were on the Rogers board and aligned with Edward Rogers, died this year.\n\u2014 With assistance by Kevin Orland\n\nThis article, authored by Derek Decloet, Bloomberg, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-12 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":156}

This time he takes aim himself from a long way out, zipping a shot into Milan Borjan's arms.\n41 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nMilan Borjan is down for an extended period of treatment. The Canada goalkeeper was clutching his left calf.\nShamar Nicholson, who appeared to be the possible culprit, exchanges a hug with Borjan after he rises to his feet but is still booked for his trouble.\n39 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nLeon Bailey hits the crossbar!

Alphonso Davies fails to beat the first defender with a corner from the right, but Canada find him in a good position on the same flank again, from where he whips a cross towards Jonathan David at the far post.\nThe forward loops a header back in the opposite direction, and the backtracking Andre Blake stretches to claim with reasonable ease.\n33 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nAlphonso Davies has a chance to send in a freekick from a useful position not far from the Jamaica penalty area in the right channel.\nHis low delivery bobbles through almost everyone before the hosts clear.\n30 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nThe action resumes with a goalkick to Canada. The game has been played at a ponderous pace at times \u2013 you sense these teams need to up the ante if a breakthrough is to come before the interval, although perhaps both are happy to remain cagey during the early stages of the tie.\n27 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nDrinks break time. Jamaica coach Heimir Hallgrimsson is wearing a fetching back-to-front white baseball cap as he offers instructions to Trivante Stewart, among others.\nA man in a marvellous yellow wig and black-and-yellow tracksuit can be seen in the stands, which are somewhat sparsely populated.\n24 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nSubstitute Trivante Stewart turns and tries his luck from distance for Jamaica, to no avail.\nThese sides are yet to find their range yet.\n21 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nIsmael Kone sends a fierce shot from outside the penalty area wide for Canada.\nTrivante Stewart has replaced Jamaica's Michail Antonio, who limped off a few minutes ago.\n18 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nBad news for West Ham United fans: Michail Antonio is down for an extended period of time and asks to be substituted.\nHe eventually rises to his feet and hobbles down the tunnel, accompanied by medical staff. Speculatively, that could be a hamstring issue.\n15 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nLeon Bailey should have scored for Jamaica again! An aerial ball down the flank bounces kindly for the Aston Villa attacker inside the penalty area on the left, deceiving Steven Vitoria.\nBailey drags his first-time shot wide of the far post. Heimir Hallgrimsson applauds as Bailey's runs continue to cause Canada problems.\n13 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nLeon Bailey can only nod the freekick on. Milan Borjan scoops the ball up in Canada's goal.\n12 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nJamaica win a freekick beyond the halfway line on the right and load the box. Well, it's not quite the penalty area, but there's a long line of players awaiting the delivery just outside of it.\n9 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nBest chance so far for Canada! Jonathan David breaks free inside the Jamaica penalty area on the right, sending Greg Leigh off balance and coming under pressure from Daniel Johnson as he closes in on goal.\nThe striker can only poke a low shot gently towards goalkeeper Andre Blake, who gathers.\n7 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nThere isn't a great deal of action to report in the sunshine. Here's how Canada looked before kickoff.\n4 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nJamaica should have scored! Leon Bailey is through on goal from a long ball but produces a tame, rushed finish that drops comfortably wide of Milan Borjan's goal with the goalkeeper well off his line.\nManager Heimir Hallgrimsson turns and shows his frustration on the sideline, while Bailey - justifiably - looks sheepish. That was well short of the quality he's capable of.\n2 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada\nLeon Bailey canters along the left flank and sends in a dangerous low cross which Canada do well to clear.

If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\nA hospital in Nebraska that matches teenage suicide survivors with a \"caring contact\" says the program has seen positive results in preventing young patients from taking their own lives.\nThe first-of-its-kind program provides follow-up care in the form of handwritten, personalized notes from the hospital's social work staff after the teens are discharged.\nWHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES NEW FUNDING FOR TEEN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS: \u2018WILL HELP SAVE LIVES\u2019\nThe notes are sent one month, two months, three months, six months, nine months and one year after discharge \u2014 and the former patients are able to write notes back as well.\nSabrina Schalley, director of care coordination at Children's Nebraska, a pediatric hospital and medical center in Omaha, Nebraska, told Fox News Digital that Caring Contacts was inspired by a similar program for adult survivors of suicide.\nIn the fall of 2019, Schalley brought the idea of personalized follow-up care to the emergency department's social workers, \"and they all liked the idea of the Caring Contacts.\"\nThe program was set to begin on May 1, 2020 \u2014 and that timing would turn out to be rather providential.\n\"We had no idea when we started that COVID was around the corner and the impact that would have on children's mental health,\" said Schalley.\n\"We quickly became so grateful for the intervention.\"\nTEEN GIRLS ARE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AT RECORD LEVELS, WITH MANY 'PERSISTENTLY SAD,' DATA REVEALS\nIn the years since the COVID pandemic began, children and teens are experiencing depression and anxiety more than ever before, according to Schalley.\n\"Here at Children\u2019s, our patients ages 11 and older are screening at risk of depression and\/or suicide at nearly 30%,\" she said.\nEach patient who receives a mental health assessment in the emergency department at Children's Nebraska is offered the chance to participate in Caring Contacts, said Schalley.\nAbout 98% of families agree to join the program, she said.\nnext Image 1 of 6\nprev next Image 2 of 6\nprev next Image 3 of 6\nprev next Image 4 of 6\nprev next Image 5 of 6\nprev Image 6 of 6\n\"These are individuals who arrive due to suicide ideation or suicide gesture or who screen positive for suicide risk through the universal screening tool that all emergency department patients ages 11 and older receive,\" Schalley told Fox News Digital.\nParents or legal guardians then sign a release form, which allows social workers at the hospital to keep in contact with the patient over the next year.\nPreviously, teenage patients who attempted suicide received no further contact from Children's Nebraska after they were discharged from the emergency department, according to the hospital's website.\nThere was \"no opportunity for Children\u2019s Hospital staff to provide ongoing encouragement and support for patients struggling with mental health needs,\" as stated on the site.\nNationally, about 27% of suicide survivors will make another attempt, said Schalley, but Children\u2019s Nebraska\u2019s numbers are now much lower.\n\"Thankfully, for the first three years of the program \u2026 7% of enrolled patients are seen in a health care environment for a subsequent attempt,\" she told Fox News Digital.\nTIKTOK TELEHEALTH? TEENS PUT AT RISK BY SELF-DIAGNOSING MENTAL HEALTH ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nOn a national level, anywhere from 31% to 55% of pediatric patients who are taken to the emergency department for a suicide attempt will receive some sort of follow-up within 30 days.\n\"One hundred percent of patients enrolled in Caring Contacts are receiving follow-up,\" noted Schalley.\n\"The program normalizes the struggles and challenges of mental health and stresses the importance of ongoing treatment.\"\nSchalley credits the success of Caring Contacts to a multitude of factors, she told Fox News Digital.\n\"The program normalizes the struggles and challenges of mental health and stresses the importance of ongoing treatment,\" she said. \"It provides positive coping skills and words of encouragement.\"\nPlus, the program \"provides the ability for the youth to maintain a positive, trusting relationship with the social worker,\" said Schalley.\nTEEN GIRLS DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS NEED \u2018CONNECTION\u2019 MOST, DOCTORS SAY\nUnexpected beneficiaries of the Caring Contacts program are the staff members who write the cards.\nParticipating in Caring Contacts has \"provided [staff] with an avenue to receive responses from the youth regarding updates on how they have progressed and hear feedback on their experience from the initial encounter,\" said Schalley.\nMackenzie Parks, a licensed clinical social worker at Children's Nebraska, said the families she encountered were \"touched and flattered\" that the hospital would offer follow-up support.\n\"The letters I\u2019ve received in return are really telling about the impact the program has on their well-being and hope for the future,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"I also feel that it helps families know that we truly do care about them when we\u2019re assessing them \u2014 not just because it\u2019s our job, but because we really want them to be safe,\" Parks added.\nTEEN GIRLS SPEND MORE TIME ON \u2018SENSITIVE\u2019 SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT THAT CAN HARM MENTAL HEALTH, REPORT SAYS\nEva Doescher, a licensed clinical social worker in Nebraska, shared similar feedback on her past Caring Contacts experiences.\n\"Caring Contacts gives me a chance to slow down and learn from the powerful, short moments that I get to connect with patients and their families,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"I feel that it helps families know we truly do care about them when we\u2019re assessing them \u2013 not just because it\u2019s our job, but because we really want them to be safe.\"\n\"Caring Contacts helps me make meaning from every interaction I have with the kids and families \u2014 that\u2019s my \u2018why,\u2019 and what keeps me going,\" added Doescher.\nTo Schalley's knowledge, Children's Nebraska is the first pediatric emergency department to implement a program like Caring Contacts; but she hopes it will not be the last.\n\"We have created a replication kit to provide other hospitals and organizations with information on how they can implement the program,\" she said, noting that Children's Nebraska has presented the Caring Contacts concept at conferences and received interest from other facilities.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nSchalley suspects that the \"intentionality\" and deliberately low-tech communication between social workers and teens is another reason the program has worked so well.\n\"It recognizes the impact of a child or adolescent telling their story to a stranger in an emergency room during a time of crisis,\" she said. \"Before, it was unlikely that the patient would hear from that social worker again.\"\n\"In our high-tech world, written words from a caring adult stand out and make a difference.\"\nNow, that same social worker will send personal notes to the patient for a year, \"offering unconditional caring and support along the way of their mental health journey.\"\n\"The cards are tangible and many of the patients report hanging them up in their rooms, keeping them in their cars or backpacks, and reading them aloud to their friends or family,\" said Schalley.\nThe cards could also work to save lives, as \"most kids who make a suicide attempt go from thought to action in 10 minutes or less,\" said Schalley.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Imagine the power of having a card to reread \u2026 telling you that you are worthy from someone you met once,\" she said. \"That\u2019s life-changing.\"\nSchalley added, \"In our high-tech world, written words from a caring adult stand out and make a difference.\"\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-10-18 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":158}

His recent comments come after Jada made major revelations about their marriage in her memoir, including how she and Will have been separated for seven years.\nDuring the event in Baltimore, Will began by speaking to the crowd about his love and admiration for his partner, who he married in 1997. \u201cI just really wanted to come out and just be here and hold it down for you the way you have held it down for me,\u201d he said during the event, as reported by The Baltimore Sun.\nThe King Richard star went on to describe the challenges and achievements he\u2019s had throughout his marriage, adding: \u201cWe have had a very, very long and tumultuous [relationship]. We call it \u2018brutiful.\u2019 It was brutal and beautiful at the same time.\"\nAt another point during the event, Will referred to his union with Jada as a \u201csloppy public experiment in unconditional love,\u201d according to the Baltimore Banner. He went on to explain that he\u2019s \u201chappier than [he\u2019s] ever been in [his] entire life\u201d and praised Jada for continuing to be by his side.\n\u201cI have achieved every single thing I have ever wanted in my entire life. There is not one thing left that I desire in this world - all of the awards, all of the money, the family - everything I\u2019ve ever dreamed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those dreams were largely built on the foundation of Jada\u2019s sacrifices. There were many times when Jada put her career aside so I could follow the dreams of mine.\u201d\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star thanked his wife for putting him \u201cbefore herself\u201d and for maintaining a good relationship with his ex-wife Sheree Zampino. Will and Zampino share a 30-year-old son, Trey Smith, who was also present for the book event at the Enoch Pratt Free Library. Speaking to the crowd, Will said that Jada\u2019s positive relationship with Zampino allowed all three of his children the chance to grow up together.\n\u201cCan you show up and love somebody for the rest of your life, even when you don\u2019t agree with them?\u201d he asked. \u201cJada is the best friend I have ever had on this planet and I am going to show up for her and support her for the rest of my life.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Will has opened up about his relationship, as it\u2019s continued to make headlines. Earlier this week, he appeared to mock the publicity storm surrounding him and Jada in a video titled \u201cOfficial statement\u201d shared on Instagram. \u201cSo, here\u2019s the thing.

{"title":"When it comes to generative AI in the enterprise, CIOs are taking it slow","context":"## When it comes to generative AI in the enterprise, CIOs are taking it slow\n\nTo hear the hype from vendors, you would think that enterprise buyers are all in when it comes to generative AI. But like any newer technology, large companies tend to move cautiously. Throughout this year, as vendors feverishly announced new generative AI-fueled products, CIOs took note.\nSome companies have actually been looking to cut back on spending, or at least stay even, not necessarily looking for new ways to spend money. The big exception is when technology enables companies to operate more efficiently, and do more with less.\nGenerative AI certainly has the potential to do that, but it also has its own costs associated with it, whether it\u2019s a higher cost for these features in a SaaS product or the price for hitting a large language model API if you\u2019re building your own software internally.\nEither way, it\u2019s important for the folks implementing the technology to understand if they are getting a return on their investment. A July Morgan Stanley survey of large company CIOs found that many were proceeding cautiously, with 56% of respondents reporting that generative AI was having an impact on their investment priorities, but only 4% had actually launched significant projects. In fact, most were still in the evaluation or proof of concept phase. This may be a fast moving area, but it fits with what we\u2019re hearing in conversations with CIOs as well.\nThat said, much like the consumerization of IT a decade ago, CIOs are under pressure to deliver the kind of experiences people are seeing when they play with ChatGPT online, says Jon Turow, a partner at Madrona Ventures.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s undeniable that enterprise employees, who are the internal customers of the CIO or CTO, have all tried ChatGPT and they know what amazing looks like. They know where it\u2019s early, and they know where it\u2019s inspiring, and for lack of a better word, where they see greatness. And so CIOs are under pressure to deliver that level,\u201d Turow told TechCrunch.\nIt has created a tension between this desire to please the internal customers, especially when some of that pressure could be coming from the CEO, and a CIO\u2019s natural tendency to move cautiously, even with something as potentially transformative as generative AI. That\u2019s going to take setting up some structure and organization around how this gets implemented over time, says Jim Rowan, principal at Deloitte, who is working with clients around how to build generative AI across companies in an organized fashion.\n\u201cA lot of the way we\u2019re working with companies is thinking about what is the infrastructure that they need to be successful. By infrastructure, I don\u2019t necessarily mean technology, but who are the people, what are the processes and the governance\u2026and giving them the capabilities to set that up,\u201d Rowan said. A big part of that is talking about use cases and how to use the technology to address a given problem.\nThis is in line with how CIOs we spoke to are approaching implementing this in their organizations. Monica Caldas, CIO at insurance company Liberty Mutual, started with a few-thousand-person proof of concept, and is looking for ways to expand that for her 45,000 employee company.\n\u201cWe know generative AI will continue to play a critical role in virtually every part of our company, so we\u2019re investing in many use cases to further develop and refine them in service of supporting our employees and giving them better internal capabilities,\u201d she said.\nMike Haney, CIO at Battelle, a firm focused on science and technology, has also been exploring generative AI use cases this year. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been doing this whole push for AI over the last maybe six or nine months and we\u2019re at the point right now where we\u2019re building specific use cases for each different team and function within the firm.\u201d He cautions that it\u2019s early, and they are still exploring ways in which it can help, but so far the results have been good in terms of offering more efficient ways to do things.\nKathy Kay, executive VP and CIO at Principal Financial Group, a financial services company, says her company started from scratch with a study group. \u201cSo any employees who had an interest or passion, we allowed them to join so there\u2019s about 100 people. It\u2019s a combination of engineers and business people, and we are curating probably 25 use cases now that they\u2019ve gone through, and three will be going into production [soon],\u201d she said.\nSharon Mandell, CIO at Juniper Networks, says that her company is participating in an initial pilot with Microsoft around Copilot for Office 365, and anecdotally, she has heard a range of feedback from people who love it to those who are less impressed, but she says trying to measure increased productivity remains a challenge, even with Microsoft beginning to provide dashboards that at least show the level of adoption and usage.\n\u201cThe hard thing about this is you don\u2019t have data on people\u2019s level of productivity. So no matter what, you\u2019re using somewhat anecdotal information until you get really good at understanding these dashboards from Microsoft showing you how people are using it,\u201d she said.\nAs companies hear about the potential power of generative AI, it\u2019s only natural that they would want to learn more about it and put it to work to help their organizations run more efficiently, but at the same time, executives are right to be somewhat cautious, recognizing that these are still early days and they have to learn through experimentation if this is truly transformative technology.\n\nThis article, authored by Ron Miller, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-15 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":160}
{"title":"6 VCs explain how startups can capture and defend marketshare in the AI era","context":"## 6 VCs explain how startups can capture and defend marketshare in the AI era\n\nYou cannot escape conversations about AI no matter how far or fast you run. Hyperbole abounds around what current AI tech will be able to do (revolutionize every industry!) and what current AI tech will be able to do (take over the world!). Closer to the ground, TechCrunch+ is working to understand where startups might find footholds in the market by levering large language models (LLMs), a recent and impactful new method of creating artificially intelligent software.\nHow AI will play in startup land is not a new topic of conversation. A few years back, one venture firm asked how AI-focused startups would monetize and whether they would suffer from impaired margins due to costs relating to running models on behalf of customers. That conversation died down, only to come roaring back in recent quarters as it became clear that while LLM technology is quickly advancing, it\u2019s hardly cheap to run in its present form.\nBut costs are only one area where we have unanswered questions. We are also incredibly curious about how startups should approach building tools for AI technologies, how defensible startup-focused AI work will prove, and how upstart tech companies should charge for AI-powered tooling.\nWith the amount of capital flowing to startups working with and building AI today, it\u2019s critical that we understand the market as best we can. So we asked a number of venture capitalists who are active in the AI investing space to walk us through what they are seeing in the market today.\nWhat we learned from the investing side of the house was useful. Rick Grinnell, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, said that within the new AI tech stack, \u201cmost of the opportunity lies in the application layer,\u201d where \u201cthe best applications will harness their in-house expertise to build specialized middle-layer tooling and blend them with the appropriate foundational models.\u201d Startups, he added, can use speed to their advantage as they work to \u201cinnovate, iterate and deploy solutions\u201d to customers.\nWill that work prove defensible in the long run? Edward Tsai, a managing partner at Alumni Ventures, told us that he had a potentially \u201ccontroversial opinion that VCs and startups may want to temporarily reduce their focus on defensibility and increase their focus on products that deliver compelling value and focusing on speed to market.\u201d Presuming massive TAM, that could work!\nRead on for answers to all our questions from:\nRick Grinnell, founder and managing partner, Glasswing Ventures\nThere are several layers to the emerging LLM stack, including models, pre-training solutions and fine-tuning tools. Do you expect startups to build striated solutions for individual layers of the LLM stack, or pursue a more vertical approach?\nIn our proprietary view of the GenAI tech stack, we categorize the landscape into four distinct layers: foundation model providers, middle-tier companies, end-market or top-layer applications, and full stack or end-to-end vertical companies.\nWe think that most of the opportunity lies in the application layer, and within that layer, we believe that in the near future, the best applications will harness their in-house expertise to build specialized middle-layer tooling and blend them with the appropriate foundational models. These are \u201cvertically integrated\u201d or \u201cfull-stack\u201d applications. For startups, this approach means a shorter time-to-market. Without negotiating or integrating with external entities, startups can innovate, iterate and deploy solutions at an accelerated pace. This speed and agility can often be the differentiating factor in capturing market share or meeting a critical market need before competitors.\nOn the other hand, we view the middle layer as a conduit, connecting the foundational aspects of AI with the refined specialized application layer. This part of the stack includes cutting-edge capabilities, encompassing model fine-tuning, prompt engineering and agile model orchestration. It\u2019s here that we anticipate the rise of entities akin to Databricks. Yet, the competitive dynamics of this layer present a unique challenge. Primarily, the emergence of foundation model providers expanding into middle-layer tools heightens commoditization risks. Additionally, established market leaders venturing into this space further intensify the competition. Consequently, despite a surge in startups within this domain, clear winners still need to be discovered.\nCompanies like Datadog are building products to support the expanding AI market, including releasing an LLM observability tool. Will efforts like what Datadog has built (and similar output from large\/incumbent tech powers) curtail the market area where startups can build and compete?\nLLM observability falls within the \u201cmiddle layer\u201d category, acting as a catalyst for specialized business applications to use foundational models. Incumbents like Datadog, New Relic and Splunk have all produced LLM observability tools and do appear to be putting a lot of R&D dollars behind this, which may curtail the market area in the short-term.\nHowever, as we have seen before with the inceptions of the internet and cloud computing, incumbents tend to innovate until innovation becomes stagnant. With AI becoming a household name that finds use cases in every vertical, startups have the chance to come in with innovative solutions that disrupt and reimagine the work of incumbents. It\u2019s still too early to say with certainty who the winners will be, as every day reveals new gaps in existing AI frameworks. Therein lie major opportunities for startups.\nHow much room in the market do the largest tech companies\u2019 services leave for smaller companies and startups tooling for LLM deployment?\nWhen considering the landscape of foundational layer model providers like Alphabet\/Google\u2019s Bard, Microsoft\/OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, it\u2019s evident that the more significant players possess inherent advantages regarding data accessibility, talent pool and computational resources. We expect this layer to settle into an oligopolistic structure like the cloud provider market, albeit with the addition of a strong open source contingency that will drive considerable third-party adoption.\nAs we look at the generative AI tech stack, the largest market opportunity lies above the model itself. Companies that introduce AI-powered APIs and operational layers for specific industries will create brand-new use cases and transform workflows. By embracing this technology to revolutionize workflows, these companies stand to unlock substantial value.\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to recognize that the market is still far from being crystallized. LLMs are still in their infancy, with adoption at large corporations and startups lacking full maturity and refinement. We need robust tools and platforms to enable broader utilization among businesses and individuals. Startups have the opportunity here to act quickly, find novel solutions to emerging problems, and define new categories.\nInterestingly, even large tech companies recognize the gaps in their services and have begun investing heavily in startups alongside VCs. These companies apply AI to their internal processes and thus see the value startups bring to LLM deployment and integration. Consider the recent investments from Microsoft, Nvidia, and Salesforce into companies like Inflection AI and Cohere.\nWhat can be done to ensure industry-specific startups that tune generative AI models for a specific niche will prove defensible?\nTo ensure industry-specific startups will prove defensible in the rising climate of AI integration, startups must prioritize collecting proprietary data, integrating a sophisticated application layer and assuring output accuracy.\nWe have established a framework to assess the defensibility of application layers of AI companies. First, the application must address a real enterprise pain point prioritized by executives. Second, to provide tangible benefits and long-term differentiation, the application should be composed of cutting-edge models that fit the specific and unique needs of the software. It\u2019s not enough to simply plug into OpenAI; rather, applications should choose their models intentionally while balancing cost, compute, and performance.\nThird, the application is only as sophisticated as the data that it is fed. Proprietary data is necessary for specific and relevant insights and to ensure others cannot replicate the final product. To this end, in-house middle-layer capabilities provide a competitive edge while harnessing the power of foundational models. Finally, due to the inevitable margin of error of generative AI, the niche market must tolerate imprecision, which is inherently found in subjective and ambiguous content, like sales or marketing.\nHow much technical competence can startups presume that their future enterprise AI customers will have in-house, and how much does that presumed expertise guide startup product selection and go-to-market motion?\nWithin the enterprise sector, there\u2019s a clear recognition of the value of AI. However, many lack the internal capabilities to develop AI solutions. This gap presents a significant opportunity for startups specializing in AI to engage with enterprise clients. As the business landscape matures, proficiency in leveraging AI is becoming a strategic imperative.\nMcKinsey reports that generative AI alone can add up to $4.4 trillion in value across industries through writing code, analyzing consumer trends, personalizing customer service, improving operating efficiencies, and more. Ninety-four percent of business leaders agree AI will be critical to all businesses\u2019 success over the next five years, and total global spending on AI is expected to reach $154 billion by the end of this year, a 27% increase from 2022. The next three years are also expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 27% \u2014 the annual AI spending in 2026 will be over $300 billion. Despite cloud computing remaining critical, AI budgets are now more than double that of cloud computing. Eighty-two percent of business leaders believe the integration of AI solutions will increase their employee performance and job satisfaction, and startups should expect a high level of desire for and experience with AI solutions in their future customers.\nFinally, we\u2019ve seen consumption, or usage-based priced tech products\u2019 growth slow in recent quarters. Will that fact lead startups building modern AI tools to pursue more traditional SaaS pricing? (The OpenAI pricing schema based on tokens and usage led us to this question.)\nThe trajectory of usage-based pricing has organically aligned with the needs of large language models, given that there is significant variation in prompt\/output sizes and resource utilization per user. OpenAI itself racks upward of $700,000 per day on compute, so to achieve profitability, these operation costs need to be allocated effectively.\nNevertheless, we\u2019ve seen the sentiment that tying all costs to volume is generally unpopular with end users, who prefer predictable systems that allow them to budget more effectively. Furthermore, it\u2019s important to note that many applications of AI don\u2019t rely on LLMs as a backbone and can provide conventional periodic SaaS pricing. Without direct token calls to the model provider, companies engaged in establishing infrastructural or value-added layers for AI are likely to gravitate toward such pricing strategies.\nThe technology is still nascent, and many companies will likely find success with both kinds of pricing models. Another possibility as LLM adoption becomes widespread is the adoption of hybrid structures, with tiered periodic payments and usage limits for SMBs and uncapped usage-based tiers tailored to larger enterprises. However, as long as large language technology remains heavily dependent on the inflow of data, usage-based pricing will unlikely go away completely. The interdependence between data flow and cost structure will maintain the relevance of usage-based pricing in the foreseeable future.\nLisa Calhoun, founding managing partner, Valor VC\nThere are several layers to the emerging LLM stack, including models, pre-training solutions, and fine-tuning tools. Do you expect startups to build striated solutions for individual layers of the LLM stack, or pursue a more vertical approach?\nWhile there are startups specializing in parts of the stack (like Pinecone), Valor\u2019s focus is on applied AI, which we define as AI that is solving a customer problem. Saile.ai is a good example \u2014 it uses AI to generate closeable leads for the Fortune 500. Or Funding U using its own trained dataset to create a more useful credit risk score. Or Allelica, using AI on treatment solutions applied to individual DNA to find the best medical treatment for you personally in a given situation.\nCompanies like Datadog are building products to support the expanding AI market, including releasing an LLM observability tool. Will efforts like what Datadog has built (and similar output from large\/incumbent tech powers) curtail the market area where startups can build and compete?\nTools like Datadog can only help the acceptance of AI tools if they succeed in monitoring AI performance bottlenecks. That in and of itself is probably still largely unexplored territory that will see a lot of change and maturing in the next few years. One key aspect there might be cost monitoring as well since companies like OpenAI charge largely \u201cby the token,\u201d which is a very different metric than most cloud computing.\nWhat can be done to ensure industry-specific startups that tune generative AI models for a specific niche will prove defensible?\n\nThis article, authored by Alex Wilhelm, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-13 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":161}
{"title":"Is Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense even trying to win?","context":"## Is Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense even trying to win?\n\nI have never seen Sam Bankman-Fried so still as he was during the prosecution\u2019s opening statement. The characteristic leg-jiggling was absent. He barely moved as the prosecutor listed the evidence against him: internal company files, what customers were told, the testimony of his co-conspirators and his own words.\nHis hair was shorn, the result of a haircut from a fellow prisoner, the Wall Street Journal reported. He wore a suit bought at a discount at Macy\u2019s, per the Journal; it hung on him. He appeared to have lost some weight.\n\u201cAll of that was built on lies.\u201d\nBankman-Fried, at this time last year, had a luxury lifestyle as the CEO of crypto exchange FTX, said the assistant US attorney, Thane Rehn, in the cadence of a high schooler delivering his lines in a student play. Bankman-Fried hung out with Tom Brady. He was on magazine covers, lived in a $30 million penthouse, and spent time with world politicians. \u201cAll of that was built on lies,\u201d Rehn said.\nIn his opening statement, Rehn dodged explaining cryptocurrency to the jury. Instead, he punched hard on Bankman-Fried lying and stealing.\nBankman-Fried sat almost motionless, occasionally glancing at Rehn, as the prosecutor told the jury that Bankman-Fried sold stock in FTX and borrowed millions from lenders by lying.\nThe story Rehn told is familiar to anyone following the news. In May and June of 2022, Alameda Research \u2014 the crypto trading company ostensibly helmed by Caroline Ellison \u2014 didn\u2019t have enough to pay its bills, so it pulled customer money to repay loans. By September, the hole in the FTX balance sheet was so big that customers could never be repaid.\nFTX \u201cdidn\u2019t have a chief risk officer, which became an issue when the storm hit.\u201d\nWhen CoinDesk published its article in November 2022, people realized FTX was a house of cards, Rehn said. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried tweeted. \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine\u201d and \u201cWe don\u2019t invest customer assets even in treasuries.\u201d\nPointing at Bankman-Fried, Rehn said, \u201cThis man stole billions of dollars from thousands of people.\u201d\nSo how was the defense going to follow it up? I was very curious, having learned yesterday that Bankman-Fried had never been offered a plea deal since he and his attorneys had told the government they wouldn\u2019t negotiate. Surely there would be some manner of evidence, some something, that would have made him so confident.\nThere was, instead, a metaphor.\nDefense attorney Mark Cohen, with the energy of a patient father telling his obnoxious children a bedtime story, assured us that working at a startup was like building a plane while flying it, and that FTX the plane had flown right into the perfect storm: the crypto crash. Except, uh, he also said this: FTX \u201cdidn\u2019t have a chief risk officer, which became an issue when the storm hit.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the missing risk officer\nThe problem with this metaphor is that if FTX was a plane, it was a plane flying with a key component missing \u2014 namely, the risk officer, an executive whose job it is to, well, manage risk. This is sort of an important thing, as risks can be anything from reputational to regulatory to financial.\nFTX was named such as it was because it was a futures exchange, which, to borrow a phrase from Bloomberg\u2019s Matt Levine, \u201csits between the winners and losers of bets.\u201d That means FTX can\u2019t pay out what it owes the winners unless the losers pay up. Risk management is a crucial part of the business; risk officers exist to identify business\u2019 potential risks, monitor, and mitigate them. This is to say nothing of the regulatory risks around crypto.\nAs Cohen droned on about airplanes, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the missing risk officer. Bringing it up, I thought, was a tremendous mistake. The prosecution hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Either Bankman-Fried is stupid \u2014 unlikely \u2014 or he deliberately didn\u2019t hire a risk officer. Was he worried about what one might find?\nSure, as Cohen put it, Bankman-Fried was a math nerd who didn\u2019t party. That paints a picture of someone who\u2019s pretty deliberate, particularly since he immediately left MIT and went to work on Wall Street. If he had been a party-hardy trainwreck, I could see overlooking a risk officer in order to do another line, or a supermodel, or something else important. Why was the defense bringing this up?\nBut as Cohen tried to tell me that FTX\u2019s and Alameda\u2019s business relationships were \u201creasonable under the circumstances,\u201d the lack of risk officer kept elbowing me in the ribs. \u201cSam acted in good faith and took reasonable business measures\u201d is a pretty hard pill to swallow with that in mind.\nMan, it\u2019s no good when your defense lawyer has just made you sound worse than the prosecution already did. And while Cohen tried to make the common white-collar defense argument that Bankman-Fried, as CEO, was simply too busy to oversee what everyone did every day, he just made me more suspicious. That\u2019s why you hire a risk officer and delegate! That\u2019s the whole point! I could barely even hear Cohen blaming Caroline Ellison and Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao for the debacle over the \u201cno risk officer\u201d ringing in my ears.\nFollowing the defense\u2019s opening statements, things got still worse for Bankman-Fried. The prosecution called its first witness, Marc-Antoine Julliard, whose money got stuck on FTX. Juilliard, who was born in Paris and lives in London, testified that he trusted FTX because Bankman-Fried came across as a leading figure of the industry. When he was evaluating the exchange, he thought the sheer volume of users was important, too \u2014 at the time, FTX was among the top three biggest exchanges. Plus, major VC firms had invested, and \u201cthey don\u2019t commit hundreds of millions without doing due diligence, checking the books, the accountancy of the firm, going through several compliance process[es], so that was a vote of confidence for me,\u201d Juilliard said. (Evidently he had not paid attention to the Elizabeth Holmes trial.)\nHe also noted FTX\u2019s glossy ads \u2014 featuring Gisele B\u00fcndchen, for instance \u2014 suggested a very high budget. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to spend that much money unless FTX had very strong financials, Juilliard figured. He opened an account, transferred in both regular money and cryptocurrency, and used the exchange to execute his plan: buying Bitcoin to sell back in five to ten years at higher prices.\nIt is a thankless task to cross-examine a customer whose money is gone\nIn November 2022, things went bad for Julliard. He followed Bankman-Fried on Twitter, and read aloud the \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine\u201d tweets, along with \u201cFTX has enough to cover all client holdings. We don\u2019t invest client assets\u201d and a few others, which gave Julliard the impression that his money was there \u2014 the problem might have been technical (anti-spam measures) or regulatory. When he tried to get his money out on November 8th, it was too late. We saw screenshots of his withdrawal attempts: $20,000 USD and about 4 Bitcoin, which were worth about $20,000 at the time: about $100,000 money, inaccessible.\nIt is a thankless task to cross-examine a customer whose money is gone, but Cohen tried anyway. He noted that Julliard was a licensed commodities broker, who was trading in crypto because he didn\u2019t have to disclose it; that Julliard knew that crypto was new and risky, and that Julliard didn\u2019t review the terms of service agreement he\u2019d assented to when making his FTX account.\nWell, sure, but so what?\nThe next witness called was Bankman-Fried\u2019s former college (and FTX) roommate, Adam Yedidia, about whom I expect I will have much more to say tomorrow.\n\nThis article, authored by Elizabeth Lopatto, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-04 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":162}

core functions, according to Castro.\nGOOGLE CLOUD AND MAYO CLINIC SET TO DISRUPT HEALTH CARE WITH GENERATIVE AI\nEducating the health care community is one focus.\n\"This person should ensure that staff and stakeholders are informed about AI technologies and their applications,\" he said.\nDeveloping and implementing the algorithms used in the AI solutions is also a key part of the job, said Castro.\nThe CAIO must understand and analyze data derived from AI to inform decision-making and strategy.\n\"This role also entails managing the use of AI across the organization, ensuring that it aligns with regulatory standards and organizational goals,\" Castro said.\nStrategy development is also inherent to the chief AI officer\u2019s job.\nNEW AI-GENERATED COVID DRUG ENTERS PHASE I

organizational values.\"\nSome of Patel\u2019s day-to-day functions include:\nOverseeing the identification, vetting and integration of AI solutions for various clinical and administrative functions\nUsing AI to improve diagnostic accuracy, optimize treatment paths and enhance the patient experience\nEngaging with stakeholders to gather insights, feedback and expertise\nEnsuring that all AI algorithms are transparent, free from biases, and designed in the best interests of patients and their communities\nFacilitating training sessions, workshops and awareness campaigns to ensure

vision rooted in our values while ensuring the tactical execution of AI projects that drive value to our patients.\"\nOne of the tech team\u2019s biggest recent contributions is an AI model that proactively assesses a person's risk of a heart attack , Patel noted.\nAS AI SHOWS UP IN DOCTORS' OFFICES, MOST PATIENTS ARE GIVING PERMISSION AS EXPERTS ADVISE CAUTION\n\"This model uses data from chest CT exams \u2014 often conducted for unrelated health issues, such as COVID or lung nodules \u2014 and identifies future heart disease risk, which unfortunately even expert physicians can't discern from the scan,\" he said.\n\"The model helps cardiologists prevent potential heart attacks rather than treating them reactively.\"\nMayo Clinic has also developed AI models that predict the prognosis of patients with diseases such as colon cancer , detect risks of future cancers using existing medical records, and predict 30-day hospital readmission or hospital-acquired infections, Patel said.\n\"AI can pinpoint details that make a significant difference in diagnosis and treatment.\"\n\"Our focus is not only to develop these AI models, but to ensure that the benefits of these models reach patients swiftly,\" he added.\nKey benefits of AI in health care\nPatel said he views AI as a \"powerful instrument\" that helps magnify physicians\u2019 capabilities rather than replacing them.\n\"One of AI's primary strengths is its ability to recognize patterns that might escape the human eye,\" he said.\n\"Whether it's intricate anomalies in medical imaging or subtle patterns in patient histories, AI can pinpoint details that make a significant difference in diagnosis and treatment.\"\nThe technology also helps providers by sifting through and analyzing vast volumes of information, far more than what would be humanly possible, Patel said.\nIt also automates mundane and routine tasks, allowing health care professionals to redirect their focus to the patient, he noted.\nAI TECH AIMS TO HELP PATIENTS CATCH DISEASE EARLY, EVEN \u2018REVERSE THEIR BIOLOGICAL AGE\u2019\nEarly risk detection is another key benefit.\n\"AI tools can predict potential health risks by analyzing a combination of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors, facilitating early interventions and potentially saving lives,\" Patel said.\nAs well, AI can help enable the delivery of personalized medicine and proactive preventative care, he noted.\n\"By analyzing individual genetic makeup combined with lifestyle and environmental factors, treatments can be tailored to the unique needs of each patient,\" Patel said.\n\"And by predicting potential health issues before they manifest, we can guide patients on preventive measures, fundamentally changing our approach from cure to prevention.\"\nPotential risks and limitations\nAI in health care also presents challenges and limitations , Patel acknowledged.\nBecause AI is a branch of science, it requires rigorous evaluation before it can be applied by doctors, he said.\nAI HEART SCAN AIMS TO CATCH BLOCKAGES YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS: \u2018UNBELIEVABLE BREAKTHROUGH\u2019\n\"This ensures that we're not just implementing

limitations and actively working to address them, we can harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of our health care system.\"\n\"AI models are, by nature, a reflection of the data they're trained on,\" he said. \"If this data contains biases \u2014 whether racial, gender-based or from other sources \u2014 the models may perpetuate these biases.\"\nThere is the additional risk that humans will become overly reliant on AI, leading to a phenomenon called \"automation bias.\"\n\"Essentially, this means giving undue weight to AI-generated results without adequate human scrutiny,\" Patel said.\n\"In health care, understanding the \u2018why\u2019 behind a diagnosis or recommendation is as crucial as the result,\" he said. \"As providers, we must always contextualize

{"title":"California\u2019s privacy watchdog eyes AI rules with opt-out and access rights","context":"## California\u2019s privacy watchdog eyes AI rules with opt-out and access rights\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) is preparing for its next trick: Putting guardrails on AI.\nThe state privacy regulator, which has an important role in setting rules of the road for digital giants given how much of Big Tech (and Big AI) is headquartered on its sun-kissed soil, has today published draft regulations for how people\u2019s data can be used for what it refers to as automated decisionmaking technology (ADMT*). Aka AI.\nThe draft represents \u201cby far the most comprehensive and detailed set of rules in the \u2018AI space'\u201d, Ashkan Soltani, the CPPA\u2019s exec director, told TechCrunch. The approach takes inspiration from existing rules in the European Union, where the bloc\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has given individuals rights over automated decisions with a legal or significant impact on them since coming into force back in May 2018 \u2014 but aims to build on it with more specific provisions that may be harder for tech giants to wiggle away from.\nThe core of the planned regime \u2014 which the Agency intends to work on finalizing next year, after a consultation process \u2014 includes opt-out rights, pre-use notice requirements and access rights which would enable state residents to obtain meaningful information on how their data is being used for automation and AI tech.\nAI-based profiling could even fall in scope of the planned rules, per the draft the CPPA has presented today. So \u2014 assuming this provision survives the consultation process and makes it into the hard-baked rules \u2014 there could be big implications for US adtech giants like Meta which has a business model that hinges on tracking and profiling users to target them with ads.\nSuch firms could be required to offer California residents the ability to deny their commercial surveillance, with the proposed law stating businesses must provide consumers with the ability to opt-out of their data being processed for behavioral advertising. The current draft further stipulates that behavioral advertising use-cases cannot make use of a number of exemptions to the opt-out right that may apply in other scenarios (such as if ADMT is being used for security or fraud prevention purposes, for example).\nThe CPPA\u2019s approach to regulating ADMT is risk-based, per Soltani. This echoes another piece of in-train EU legislation: the AI Act \u2014 a dedicated risk-based framework for regulating applications of artificial intelligence which has been on the table in draft form since 2021 but is now at a delicate stage of co-legislation, with the bloc\u2019s lawmakers clashing over the not-so-tiny-detail of how (or even whether) to regulate Big AI, among several other policy disputes on the file.\nGiven the discord around the EU\u2019s AI Act, as well as the ongoing failure of US lawmakers to pass a comprehensive federal privacy law \u2014 since there\u2019s only so much presidential Executive Orders can do \u2014 there\u2019s a plausible prospect of California ending up as one of the top global rulemakers on AI.\nThat said, the impact of California\u2019s AI rules is likely to remain local, given its focus on affording protections and controls to state residents. In-scope companies might choose to go further \u2014 such as, say, offering the same package of privacy protections to residents of other US states. But that\u2019s up to them. And, bottom line, the CPPA\u2019s reach and enforcement is tied to the California border.\nIts bid to tackle AI follows the introduction of GDPR-inspired privacy rules, back in 2019, with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) coming into effect in early 2020. Since then the Agency has been pushing to go further. And, in fall 2020, a ballot measure secured backing from state residents to reinforce and redefine parts of the privacy law. The new measures laid out in draft today to address ADM are part of that effort.\n\u201cThe proposed regulations would implement consumers\u2019 right to opt out of, and access information about, businesses\u2019 uses of ADMT, as provided for by the [CCPA],\u201d the CPPA wrote in a press release. \u201cThe Agency Board will provide feedback on these proposed regulations at the December 8, 2023, board meeting, and the Agency expects to begin formal rulemaking next year.\u201d\nIn parallel, the regulator is considering draft risk assessment requirements which are intended to work in tandem with the planned ADMT rules. \u201cTogether, these proposed frameworks can provide consumers with control over their personal information while ensuring that automated decisionmaking technologies, including those made from artificial intelligence, are used with privacy in mind and in design,\u201d it suggests.\nCommenting in a statement, Vinhcent Le, member of the regulator\u2019s board and of the New Rules Subcommittee that drafted the proposed regulations, added: \u201cOnce again, California is taking the lead to support privacy-protective innovation in the use of emerging technologies, including those that leverage artificial intelligence. These draft regulations support the responsible use of automated decisionmaking while providing appropriate guardrails with respect to privacy, including employees\u2019 and children\u2019s privacy.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s being proposed by the CPPA?\nThe planned regulations deal with access and opt-out rights in relation to businesses\u2019 use of ADMT.\nPer an overview of the draft regulation, the aim is to establish a regime that will let state residents request an opt-out from their data being used for automated decisionmaking \u2014 with a relatively narrow set of exemptions planned where use of the data is necessary (and solely intended) for either: Security purposes (\u201cto prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents\u201d); fraud prevention; safety (\u201cto protect the life and physical safety of consumers\u201d); or for a good or service requested by the consumer.\nThe latter comes with a string of caveats, including that the business \u201chas no reasonable alternative method of processing\u201d; and must demonstrate \u201c(1) the futility of developing or using an alternative method of processing; (2) an alternative method of processing would result in a good or service that is not as valid, reliable, and fair; or (3) the development of an alternative method of processing would impose extreme hardship upon the business\u201d.\nSo \u2014 tl;dr \u2014 a business that intends to use ADMT and is trying to use a (crude) argument that, simply because the product contains automation\/AI users can\u2019t opt-out of their data being processed\/fed to the models, looks unlikely to wash. At least not without the company going to extra effort to stand up a claim that, for instance, less intrusive processing would not suffice for their use-case.\nBasically, then, the aim is for there to be a compliance cost attached to trying to deny consumers the ability to opt-out of automation\/AI being applied to their data.\nOf course a law that lets consumers opt-out of privacy-hostile data processing is only going to work if the people involved are aware how their information is being used. Hence the planned framework also sets out a requirement that businesses wanting to apply ADMT must provide so-called \u201cpre-use notices\u201d to affected consumers \u2014 so they can decide whether to opt-out of their data being used (or not); or indeed whether to exercise their access right to get more info about the intended use of automation\/AI.\nThis too looks broadly similar to provisions in the EU\u2019s GDPR which put transparency (and fairness) obligations on entities processing personal data \u2014 in addition to requiring a valid lawful basis for them to use personal data.\nAlthough the European regulation contains some exceptions \u2014 such as where info was not directly collected from individuals and fulfilling their right to be informed would be \u201cunreasonably expensive\u201d or \u201cimpossible\u201d \u2014 which may have undermined EU lawmakers\u2019 intent that data subjects should be kept informed. (Perhaps especially in the realm of AI \u2014 and generative AI \u2014 where large amounts of personal data have clearly been scraped off the Internet but web users have not been proactively informed about this heist of their info; see, for example, regulatory action against Clearview AI. Or the open investigations of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.)\nThe proposed Californian framework also includes GDPR-esque access rights which will allow state residents to ask a business to provide them with: Details of their use of ADMT; the technology\u2019s output with respect to them; how decisions were made (including details of any human involvement; and whether the use of ADMT was evaluated for \u201cvalidity, reliability and fairness\u201d); details of the logic of the ADMT, including \u201ckey parameters\u201d affecting the output; and how they applied to the individual; information on the range of possible outputs; and info on how the consumer can exercise their other CCPA rights and submit a complaint about the use of ADMT.\nAgain, the GDPR provides a broadly similar right \u2014 stipulating that data subjects must be provided with \u201cmeaningful information about the logic involved\u201d in automated decisions that have a significant\/legal effect on them. But it\u2019s still falling to European courts to interpret where the line lies when it comes to how much (or how specific the) information algorithmic platforms must hand over in response to these GDPR subject access requests (see, for example, litigation against Uber in the Netherlands where a number of drivers have been trying to get details of systems involved in flagging accounts for potential fraud).\nThe CCPA looks to be trying to pre-empt attempts by ADMT companies to evade the transparency intent of providing consumers with access rights \u2014 by setting out, in greater detail, what information they must provide in response to these requests. And while the draft framework does include some exemptions to access rights, just three are proposed: Security, fraud prevention and safety \u2014 so, again, this looks like an attempt to limit excuses and (consequently) expand algorithmic accountability.\nNot every use of ADMT will be in-scope of the CCPA\u2019s proposed rules. The draft regulation proposes to set a threshold as follows:\nFor a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer (e.g., decisions to provide or deny employment opportunities). Profiling a consumer who is acting in their capacity as an employee, independent contractor, job applicant, or student. Profiling a consumer while they are in a publicly accessible place.\nThe Agency also says the upcoming consultation will discuss whether the rules should also apply to: profiling a consumer for behavioral advertising; profiling a consumer the business has \u201cactual knowledge is under the age of 16\u201d (i.e. profiling children); and processing the personal information of consumers to train ADMT \u2014 indicating it\u2019s not yet confirmed how much of the planned regime will apply to (and potentially limit the modus operandi of) adtech and data-scraping generative AI giants.\nThe more expansive list of proposed thresholds would clearly make the law bite down harder on adtech giants and Big AI. But, it being California, the CCPA can probably expect a lot of pushback from local giants like Meta and OpenAI, to name two.\nThe draft proposal marks the start of the CPPA\u2019s rulemaking process, with the aforementioned consultation process \u2014 which will include a public component \u2014 set to kick off in the coming weeks. So it\u2019s still a ways off a final text. A spokeswoman for the CPPA said it\u2019s unable to comment on a possible timeline for the rulemaking but she noted this is something that will be discussed at the upcoming board meeting, on December 8.\nIf the Agency is able to move quickly it\u2019s possible it could have a regulation finalized in the second half of next year. Although there would obviously need to be a grace period before compliance kicks in for in-scope companies \u2014 so 2025 looks like the very earliest for a law to be up and running. And who knows how far developments in AI will have moved on by then.\n* The CPPA\u2019s proposed definition for ADMT in the draft framework is \u201cany system, software, or process \u2014 including one derived from machine-learning, statistics, other data-processing or artificial intelligence \u2014 that processes personal information and uses computation as whole or part of a system to make or execute a decision or facilitate human decisionmaking\u201d. Its definition also affirms \u201cADMT includes profiling\u201d \u2014 which is defined as \u201cany form of automated processing of personal information to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person and in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location, or movements\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-27 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":164}

The good news: We watch it all so you don\u2019t have to. Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\nIf there\u2019s one thing we love here at Polygon, it\u2019s the Halloween season.\nWe cover horror year-round, whether it\u2019s the best horror movies you can stream at home or the best horror movies on Netflix, and generally, we have our finger on the undead pulse of the newest and ghastliest releases in horror. We even have a list of the best horror movies of the year (ranked by scariness, of course).\nEven still, Halloween is an especially spooky time of year, and it warrants special attention and celebration.\nFor the past three years, Polygon has put together a Halloween countdown calendar, selecting 31 of our staff\u2019s top horror-themed or Halloween-adjacent picks across movies and TV throughout the month of October, all available to watch at home. We\u2019ve loved doing it, so much so that we\u2019re bringing it back again \u2014 this time with a whole new batch of films and shows to choose from.\nEvery day for the month of October, we\u2019ll add a new recommendation to this countdown and tell you where you can watch it. So curl up on the couch, dim the lights, and grab some popcorn for a terrifying and entertaining marathon of horrific delights.\nOct. 1: Messiah of Evil\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, Shudder, Pluto TV, Plex\nA undersung classic of \u201970s cosmic horror, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz\u2019s Messiah of Evil is a surreal and nightmarish experience that more than deserves its status as a cult horror classic.\nThe film centers on Arletty, a young woman who journeys to the remote coastal town of Point Dume, California, to track down her missing father, a reclusive painter who is plagued by disturbing visions of an impending apocalypse. After crossing paths with an eccentric aristocrat and his groupie companions, the group bears witness to the realization of the painter\u2019s prophecy, as the townspeople are transformed into flesh-eating ghouls and the messiah of evil makes his return to the mortal realm.\nAt times convoluted and bizarre, Messiah of Evil is a genuinely entertaining horror thriller filled with memorable scares and chilling set-pieces. From a cross-eyed albino man gleefully devouring a field mouse whole to a unsuspecting woman watching a Western as the theater around her slowly fills with ravenous undead zombies, it\u2019s a dreamy and frightening experience that lands somewhere between the ineffable gothic horror of H.P. Lovecraft and the anti-consumerist allegories of George A. Romero. The horrors hold up over 50 years after it was first released, and with just the right combination of inadvertent silliness and legitimate terror, Messiah of Evil is a satisfying watch and an excellent start to a month of horrors. \u2014Toussaint Egan\nOct. 2: Ginger Snaps\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel, Shudder, Peacock, Vudu, Tubi, Freevee, Plex\nThere\u2019s a sizable hole in the monster movie canon: There just aren\u2019t enough good werewolf movies! Ginger Snaps is here to fix that. And if you love Jennifer\u2019s Body, you\u2019re in for a bloody treat.\nDirected by future Orphan Black co-creator John Fawcett, Ginger Snaps is a delightfully gruesome story about two sisters. One of them has gotten her period for the first time, and is turned into a werewolf shortly after. Things get messy, fast.\nGinger Snaps doesn\u2019t just do a great job filling in the werewolf canon. It\u2019s a grisly body horror story placed onto an effective puberty allegory, with a compelling central sister relationship. If you\u2019ve ever watched something like Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man and thought, This is great and surprisingly gooey, but give me stories like this about teen girls, then Ginger Snaps is for you.\nThe movie has amassed a dedicated cult following in the years since its release. You\u2019re next up to join the ranks \u2014 see you at the next full moon! \u2014Pete Volk\nOct. 3: Creepshow\nWhere to watch: Kanopy\nThe new Creepshow home video release \u2014 presented in vibrant 4K UHD Blu-ray \u2014 is the best way to revisit this horror anthology classic. You can see individual bubbles in the foam of the ocean as it slowly drowns Ted Danson. This is why it made our list of the best Blu-rays of 2023.\nBut reader, while I\u2019m one of those sickos who obsesses over video resolution and bitrate, I\u2019ll be honest: You don\u2019t need the fanciest version of Creepshow to enjoy its comedic chills. In fact, the most aesthetically harmonious format might be a poorly treated VHS tape that recorded the film off TBS in the mid-1990s.\nHorror anthologies have most recently been used to condense as much terror into a tiny package, like chugging a shot glass of hot sauce. Creepshow is a throwback to a softer, more leisurely style of horror \u2014 a middle ground between the plodding tinglers of Poe and contemporary slashers.\nPlus, Stephen King performs a one-person show as a hillbilly. So like, that should be enough. \u2014Chris Plante\nOct. 4: Pulse\nWhere to watch: Prime Video\nWhat if technology could be used to communicate with the dead? It\u2019s an idea that dates as far back as the spiritualism movement of the late 19th century, and one that takes on a frightening and fascinating dimension in Kiyoshi Kurosawa\u2019s post-Y2K horror-thriller Pulse.\nAlternating between two storylines, Kurosawa\u2019s film follows a group of young adults and university students as a rash of inexplicable disappearances and suicides occurs around Tokyo. As the protagonists investigate further, they slowly uncover a shocking revelation: The souls of the dead are spilling over into the mortal world and ensnaring their unsuspecting prey through the very infrastructure of the internet. By the time they realize this, however, it\u2019s too late; the unearthly contagion has taken on a life of its own, and the only way to survive is cling to what few connections they have left.\nProduced after Kurosawa\u2019s Cure (which we featured on last year\u2019s Halloween calendar), Pulse is widely celebrated as one of the foundational texts in the canon of J-horror cinema, alongside Hideo Nakata\u2019s Ring and Takashi Shimizu\u2019s Ju-on: The Curse. Eerie and methodical, Kurosawa\u2019s film is a nihilistic meditation on technology and human relationships that presages an advent of loneliness in a world growing more and more \u201cconnected\u201d with each passing day. Rife with imagery that will stay with you long after it\u2019s over, Pulse is a tremendous and terrifying movie worth experiencing. \u2014TE\nOct. 5: Apostle\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nDon\u2019t confuse Gareth Edwards (director of The Creator and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) with Gareth Evans, director of the Raid movies. If you do, you may sit down to the Netflix-exclusive Apostle expecting expansive, detail-driven science fiction, and be unpleasantly surprised when you get a grimy, extremely gory period piece that goes to startling extremes.\nEvans\u2019 mesmerizing Apostle deliberately starts in roughly the same place as the classic 1973 suspense thriller The Wicker Man, with a lone man heading to a remote Welsh island after getting a letter suggesting his sister is being held against her will there by a dangerous cult. Worming his way into the community by pretending to be a convert, Thomas (Dan Stevens, even more feral and intense than he is in The Guest or Beauty and the Beast) inevitably discovers a lot of nasty work going on on the island.\nEvans charts his own course with Apostle, veering far from the Wicker Man mold and into much bloodier territory. But he takes advantage of some of the same ideas: the ominous isolation of the island, the close-knit secrecy of its community, the predatory ideas that have flourished there under charismatic leadership. Stevens is particularly terrific in this movie, lunging from one scene to the next like a humanoid wolf who can barely contain his bloodlust. (Thomas has plenty of closely held secrets of his own.) And Evans\u2019 commitment to violent mayhem gives this one some memorable moments that are likely to haunt you later, in the dark. \u2014Tasha Robinson\nOct. 6: Dracula 2000\nWhere to watch: Max\nWith the scars of nu-metal having healed and Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Paramore-infused pop tracks having gone full \u201cvampire,\u201d now is the time to give Gerard Butler\u2019s half-bare-chest take on Dracula the respect it\u2019s due.\nMaybe the most Dimension Films movie to ever bear the Dimension Films studio logo (close second: The Faculty), Dracula 2000 finds a group of thieves \u2014 including of-the-moment faces like Omar Epps, Jennifer Esposito, and Shane West! \u2014 transporting a stolen silver coffin from London to New Orleans. They think there\u2019s treasure inside. Are they idiots? Absolutely. And when they find Dracula instead of gold doubloons or whatever, they unleash hell. Overacted, canted-angled, seven-string-guitar-plucking HELL. Luckily, as Dracula hunts down local college student Mary Van Helsing (Justine Waddell), with whom he already shares a psychic connection, Mary\u2019s dad\u2019s new vampire-hunter assistant Simon (young Jonny Lee Miller!) is on his tail.\nButler, never more a heartthrob, plays Dracula in a mesmerizing, baroque manner; think Nicolas Cage doing Dracula if this year\u2019s Renfield was emo turn-of-the-millennium trash. And he\u2019s constantly biting unsuspecting B-list actors to add to his army of hot people, who fight the heroes in multiple obligatory scenes of wire-fu. Writer-director Patrick Lussier cuts it all up like it\u2019s the video for \u201cFreak on a Leash,\u201d and, well, objectively, it\u2019s quite unlike most horror movies you can watch today! Enjoyment of Dracula 2000 may vary depending on a tolerance for Hot Topic goofs, but if you don\u2019t catch up with it, you can\u2019t enjoy Lussier\u2019s sequel, Dracula II: Ascension, starring Jason Scott Lee as a martial-arts-fighting priest who kicks Dracula\u2019s ass! \u2014Matt Patches\nOct. 7: Prince of Darkness\nWhere to watch: Peacock\nThere aren\u2019t enough movies about the end of the world. Sure, there are plenty of movies about preventing catastrophe at that scale, but rarely do they have the follow-through to truly get existentially terrifying. Thankfully, John Carpenter is no coward, and he made three movies about different kinds of apocalypses. But while The Thing is the best known, and In the Mouth of Madness is the zaniest, Prince of Darkness might be the scariest of the trilogy.\nPrince of Darkness follows a group of college researchers who are sent to study a strange canister found in the basement of a church. The canister is filled with some kind of liquid that defies science, and when it starts to get released, a strange evil seems to come into the world with it.\nThis is Carpenter at his most ambitious. While most of this movie is set in just one building, all manner of horror makes its way inside. There are people made of bugs, horrific zombies, an extradimensional Satan, and things even worse to behold. The entire movie is an onslaught of creepy, skin-crawling images, all built out of a unique mythology about the relationship between good and evil that underpins the world. And, most importantly, after this parade of horrors seems to come to an end, Carpenter saves Prince of Darkness\u2019 biggest, weirdest, most dreadful scare for last. \u2014Austen Goslin\nOct. 8: Gravity Falls - Northwest Mansion Mystery\nWhere to watch: Hulu, Disney Plus (season 2, episode 10)\nThe more time that has passed since Gravity Falls concluded, the more miraculous it feels in hindsight. Alex Hirsch\u2019s paranormal comedy show about 12-year-old twins Dipper and Mabel, who solve supernatural mysteries in their great-uncle\u2019s home in rural Oregon, is the perfect entry point for young horror-loving audiences. It\u2019s a pastiche of The X-Files, Twin Peaks, and Adventure Time all rolled into one, with the freewheeling, funloving spirit of a summer vacation. There\u2019s tons of fantastic episodes to choose from, but if you\u2019re looking for an especially spooky one to get in the Halloween spirit, you can\u2019t go wrong with \u201cNorthwest Mansion Mystery.\u201d\nA ghost has taken up residence in the mansion estate of the wealthiest family in Gravity Falls on the eve of their annual party, and Dipper has been enlisted to exorcize it. Upon arriving at the mansion, Dipper and popular girl Pacifica Northwest uncover a dark family secret that\u2019s been buried for generations, one that threatens to not only tarnish the family\u2019s reputation, but engulf the entire town. For a series ostensibly aimed at young children, it\u2019s kind of wild just how scary \u201cNorthwest Mansion Mystery\u201d gets, with taxidermy animals bleeding from their mouths, flaming skeletal lumberjacks, and hapless partygoers being petrified into screaming wooden statues. It\u2019s a blast, and a solid stand-alone episode to introduce new audiences to the all the spooky (and \u201cspoopy\u201d) delights Gravity Falls has to offer. \u2014TE\nOct. 9: The Scooby-Doo Project\nWhere to watch: YouTube\nScooby-Doo got extremely dark for a few years in the early 2000s, which also happened to be the best years of the series since its heyday in the 1970s. But while movies like The Witch\u2019s Ghost and Zombie Island are absolutely excellent (and still hold up), among the most interesting hidden gems of the series is The Scooby-Doo Project.\nLike its name implies, this was a parody of The Blair Witch Project that stars the Mystery Inc. gang. Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Velma, and Daphne set off in the Mystery Machine to the remote woods of Casper County. The movie is filmed in the same documentary style that The Blair Witch Project made iconic, and mostly inserts the gang into live-action locations like real woods or a real town where they interview locals.\nThe project was originally created as a bumper to bookend segments of a 1999 Scooby-Doo marathon (just a few months after the movie it was based on was released), but after Cartoon Network saw what the creators put together, it wisely decided to re-air the short segments end-to-end as a movie.\nThe Scooby-Doo Project not only stands alongside the original Blair Witch as an impressive and loving parody, but also as a similarly unnerving found-footage horror movie. The gang standing around among live-action backgrounds is creepy enough on its own, but hearing the beloved characters be accosted by unseen forces as they sprint through the woods is downright scary \u2014 particularly if you were a kid watching this for the first time in 1999, well before you saw The Blair Witch Project.\nBut the best part of The Scooby-Doo Project comes at the end when, much like the other Scooby-Doo movies of the time, we get a soft implication that the supernatural elements of the story were actually real and the horrors won\u2019t stop when the villain\u2019s mask comes off. It\u2019s a downright haunting ending, and manages to match the excellence of its source material, which is high praise for any horror movie, let alone a Scooby-Doo parody. \u2014AG\nOct. 10: Saloum\nWhere to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus\nOne of the best movies of 2022 was this criminally underseen Senegalese thriller. Saloum follows three extremely cool mercenaries whose post-mission flight home gets interrupted. The trio find themselves in a mysterious village where something is off, and the tension slowly ramps up into a chaotic finale.\nThe trio of lead actors are absolutely magnetic \u2014 Yann Gael (1899), Roger Sallah, and the late Mentor Ba bring the trio of loyal friends who also happen to be extremely deadly professionals fully to life. And with fantastic costume design, a stirring score, and compelling images from award-winning music video director Jean Luc Herbulot, Saloum is 84 minutes of genre-bending excellence.\nSaloum first premiered at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival, and the movie went on to win awards at Fantastic Fest and the Vancouver International Film Festival. And yet, way too few people have seen it. This is your chance to correct the record and help make Saloum the cult classic it deserves to be. \u2014PV\nOct. 11: Heck\nWhere to watch: YouTube\nSkinamarink has proven to be one of the most polarizing horror releases of 2023. Kyle Edward Ball\u2019s feature debut about two children trapped alone inside their home by a malevolent entity eschews the formal conventions of traditional cinematography and plot, consisting instead of a series of canted-angle shots of dark hallways and yawning darkness that forces the audience to ruminate on the horrors that lay therein. Personally, I vibed with it heavily, and so it should come as no surprise that I quite enjoyed Ball\u2019s 2020 short film Heck as well.\nConceived as a \u201cproof of concept\u201d for Skinamarink, the short is told from the perspective of a young child who wakes in the dead of night to the blaring sound of their mother\u2019s television set. With their mother seemingly nowhere to be found, the child is left to their own devices, with no means of either leaving the house or calling for help. As the interminable night drags on, with hours morphing into days morphing into weeks morphing into months of penumbral isolation, the child grows more fearful and feral, resorting to increasingly more desperate acts of disobedience in hopes of rousing their mother from sleep. This effort, however, is ultimately proven to be in vain.\nHeck circles the same rough ideas and themes of Skinamarink to different effect, channeling the vulnerability of a child and the horror of abandonment and neglect to create an experimental horror experience that demands the audience\u2019s full attention. It\u2019s a fascinating companion to Skinamarink that shows just how far Ball has come as a director honing in on this particular strain of horror, and makes it all the more intriguing to speculate on what he might conjure up next. \u2014TE\nOct. 12: Harper\u2019s Island\nWhere to watch: Available to purchase on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\nIn theory, slasher TV should be easier to pull off. Episodic structure lends itself well to a slowly dwindling cast, with a killer on the loose and a different death each episode. This, as Lizzie McGuire (as Isabella the pop star) says, is what dreams are made of. And yet, show after show flubs it, because they can\u2019t find interesting enough characters or dilemmas in what should be an endlessly engaging premise.\nBut the rules are different on Harper\u2019s Island.\nThe small Pacific Northwest island was home to a serial killing where Abby (Elaine Cassidy) lost her mom almost a decade ago. She only returns at the start of the series under the most extreme of circumstances: her best friend Henry\u2019s (Christopher Gorham) wedding. And unfortunately, the island\u2019s deadly legacy is about to get a whole lot worse.\nThe thing is: The show is a perfect low-rent masterpiece. Being from 2009, it feels like a time capsule for both bootcut jeans and miniseries. At a tight 13 episodes, Harper\u2019s Island knows what it\u2019s about (killing people) and gets right to it (brutally). And yet, the beauty of Harper\u2019s Island and its antics is how long it\u2019s able to sustain a levelheaded approach to a purely absurd And Then There Were None scenario, right down to how long nobody knows they\u2019re being picked off. Almost no death is like the last, which seems purely impractical from a serial killing perspective but makes for great TV. The episode titles are the onomatopoeias for how people die, for Christ\u2019s sake! It\u2019s all very fun and twisty, as bodies and mystery continue to mount. Harper\u2019s Island makes slasher TV look fun and easy. More TV should be like Harper\u2019s Island. \u2014Zosha Millman\nOct. 13: American Horror Story: NYC\nWhere to watch: Hulu\nI have already gone on record about how I cannot look away from the trash fire that is most seasons of American Horror Story. But last season really solidified the reason I even watched the show in the first place. Namely, when AHS is good, it\u2019s really good.\nAHS: NYC opens up with a serial killer on the prowl. That, coupled with the leather-clad spectral figure that seems to be haunting the main characters, seems like it\u2019s just typical AHS schlock. But it\u2019s so much more than that. Yes, there is a serial killer who uncannily resembles Jeffrey Dahmer, and the scenes where he stalks and tortures his victims are pretty scary. And yes, there is a leather daddy ghost that has no name or face. And yes, there\u2019s a lot of dubiously consensual BDSM scenes. But the real horror comes from the powerlessness of the queer community in the face of the AIDS crisis.\nCreator Ryan Murphy builds this overwhelming, inescapable sense of dread. All AHS seasons hinge on their titular premise, which, more often than not, is a location. It\u2019s not always done effectively, but in NYC, Murphy and the writers heighten the foreboding terror of being alone in a city of millions, of feeling helpless in a crowded room, of knowing that there\u2019s something out to get you but not being able to do anything about that.\nThe whole season is surprisingly subdued for AHS (yes, even with the sex cages), and it builds up to a painfully poignant finale scene where, for 10 minutes set to Kraftwerk\u2019s \u201cRadioactivity,\u201d one of the main characters wordlessly trudges through the next 10 years of his life, watching everyone around him slowly succumb to AIDS, as horror and reality blend together. \u2014Petrana Radulovic\nOct. 14: Cat People\nWhere to watch: Max\nWant to be a smarter horror fan this October? Watch the movie that originated the modern jump scare, and then impress people at Halloween parties with this knowledge.\nCat People is not only a key part of horror movie history, it\u2019s a delightfully dark and sexy time positively radiating with atmosphere. The movie follows a woman (Simone Simon) who is caught between her desire for a new man in her life (Kent Smith) and her belief that she is cursed to turn into a panther if she becomes aroused. And at 73 minutes, it\u2019s one of the shorter horror classics you can watch this fall.\nNow for that jump scare origin. There\u2019s a tense sequence in this movie where one character stalks another. Director Jacques Tourneur lets the tension build to an unbearable level before surprising the audience with the sudden appearance of a bus. Often considered the first example of the modern jump scare, it was called the \u201cLewton Bus\u201d after producer Val Lewton, who used the technique again in later movies. \u2014PV\nOct. 15: The Neon Demon\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, Hoopla, Freevee\nModeling is a cutthroat industry, and that goes double in Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s 2016 horror movie The Neon Demon.\nThe movie follows Elle Fanning as Jesse, a young model who just moved to Los Angeles and quickly gets taken under the wing of makeup artist Ruby (Jena Malone). As Jesse becomes more successful as a model, she meets various members of the industry who are willing to part the seas for her even as she makes enemies who get caught up in a wake she unknowingly creates. Even when people are being nice to her, no one lets Jesse pass without making it clear they\u2019re jealous of her beauty and curious about what she can give them\u2026 or that they can take from her.\nHere, like in Drive, Refn\u2019s version of LA is soaked in dread and seediness in every corner. Every person reads like a threat, and every new competitor or friend seems to be looking for a new way to drain the life out of the people around them \u2014 until they finally actually do it. But, like all Refn projects, what really sets The Neon Demon apart is how it looks. The griminess of the movie\u2019s world turns brightly lit photo shoots into shadow-filled nightmares, with people who stalk the sets like jungle predators.\nThough The Neon Demon didn\u2019t get the same acclaim as other so-called elevated horror movies from the time, looking back, it fits perfectly among the ranks of The Witch, It Follows, and Under the Skin. Refn\u2019s nightmarish modeling movie is dripping with cynicism, cruelty, and a creeping atmosphere, with more meanness than almost any other movie from the era could muster. But it\u2019s all in the pursuit of beauty, of course. \u2014AG\nOct. 16: Project Wolf Hunting\nWhere to watch: Hi-Yah!; available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\nSometimes, what you\u2019re looking for is just literal tons of blood and gore. And when that\u2019s contained in a premise that\u2019s essentially \u201cCon Air meets Predator, with a bit of The Last Voyage of the Demeter,\u201d that\u2019s hard to beat.\nProject Wolf Hunting is a Korean monster mash built out of an extremely fun idea. \u201cWhat if a bunch of dangerous criminals rebelled on the cargo ship they were being transported on, only to discover the ship is also transporting a monster?\u201d\nThe story is necessarily light, and the characters are thinly drawn (although the effective costuming and makeup work go a long way), but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for if you\u2019re watching Project Wolf Hunting. You\u2019re here for gory violence, and boy, is there a lot of it. The director has bragged that the team used 2.5 tons of fake blood while filming the movie, and it certainly shows. It\u2019s one of the goriest movies I\u2019ve ever seen, and that gore is augmented by terrific sound design, which builds the monster up into something well beyond the realm of humankind by making its movements sound metallic. It\u2019s a machine designed for killing, and Project Wolf Hunting is a movie designed for a bloody good time. \u2014PV\nOct. 17: Kuroneko\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel, Max\nLike his 1964 film Onibaba (which we featured in our 2021 Halloween countdown), Kaneto Shindo\u2019s 1968 supernatural horror film is a cerebral, gorgeous, and eerie drama set amid the tumultuous Sengoku period of Japanese history.\nKuroneko centers on the story of two women, a mother and her daughter-in-law, who are raped and murdered by a wandering band of samurai who set fire to their family home. Haunted by vengeance, their spirits forge a pact with the demons of the underworld, resurrecting them in exchange for the death of any samurai unfortunate enough to cross their paths. As the death toll rises, a young samurai is enlisted to fend off the wayward spirits once and for all, unaware of either the origins behind their malice or their tragic connection to his own past.\nKiyomi Kuroda\u2019s cinematography in Kuroneko is a master class in minimalism, employing an intense contrast of light and shadow to produce sequences that feel downright otherworldly to behold. Whether it\u2019s scenes of samurai wandering through a void of darkness by the Raj\u014dmon gates or a dreamlike pan through a bamboo thicket overlaid as a character ruminates over the past, the film is a gorgeous display of deft cinematic craftsmanship in service of telling a dramatic and terrifying story of love, revenge, and regret. \u2014TE\nOct. 18: A Wounded Fawn\nWhere to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus\nOne of 2022\u2019s best under-the-radar horror movies takes its inspiration from an old-fashioned source: Greek mythology.\nDirector Travis Stevens (Jakob\u2019s Wife) melds Greek mythic imagery with an unconventional serial killer narrative in a thrilling combination that breathes new life into the genre. The movie follows a museum curator who goes on a date with a serial killer. She finds him out once she notices a statue, The Wrath of Erinyes, that is in his home but shouldn\u2019t be. From there, things get really strange.\nShot on 35mm, A Wounded Fawn is a gorgeous movie to behold, even before the action truly starts. Once it does, be prepared for a descent into the phantasmagoric, with jaw-dropping visuals, eerie practical effects, and a heavy dose of Aeschylus\u2019 Eumenides.\nWith fantastic performances from Sarah Lind (Jakob\u2019s Wife) and Dropout veteran Josh Ruben (Werewolves Within) in an unsettlingly off-type role, A Wounded Fawn is a bold new entry into the serial killer movie canon. \u2014PV\nOct. 19: The Hole in the Ground\nWhere to watch: Max\nFew horror tropes get as much mileage as the image of the unnatural child. Likely that\u2019s because the idea that kids should be innocent and cheerful is baked into so many human cultures that a child acting spooky and inhuman is a terrific cross-cultural recipe for horror. But an effective creepy-kid movie requires a spectacular creepy kid performer. James Quinn Markey fully delivers in The Hole in the Ground, the debut feature of Evil Dead Rise director Lee Cronin. But the movie isn\u2019t just about a scary child \u2014 it\u2019s about all the psychological baggage involved in dealing with one.\nSe\u00e1na Kerslake stars as Sarah, a woman recently moved to the Irish countryside with her young son, Chris (Markey). After an unnerving incident, she starts to believe Chris has been replaced by an inhuman doppelg\u00e4nger. There\u2019s plenty of evidence that it\u2019s true, at least for the audience. But an erratic, violent local woman who also believes her son was replaced serves as a warning for Sarah, both about how she can expect the community to dismiss her anxieties, and more potently, as a dark mirror of her fears, a suggestion that she might just be losing her mind. This incredibly dark and squirmy movie is much quieter and more internal than Evil Dead Rise, but it sure puts the screws to the audience, especially as it builds to an unforgettable, horrifying climax. \u2014TR\nOct. 20: Silent Hill\nWhere to watch: Peacock\nThe mid-2000s were a no man\u2019s land for horror movies. By 2006, we were four years out from the blockbuster prestige of Gore Verbinski\u2019s The Ring and the J-horror import boom that followed it in America, and only just beginning to transition into the Saw-dominated years of \u201crealistic\u201d horror. More importantly, we were still almost a decade away from the arthouse horror boom that would kick off closer to 2014 with films like It Follows. This was exactly the environment Silent Hill was released into, and it deserved so much better.\nThe movie follows Rose, whose daughter, Sharon, is plagued with awful episodes of sleepwalking and nightmares about the mysterious abandoned town of Silent Hill. Rose brings Sharon to the town in a last-ditch attempt to find answers, but things go horribly wrong when the fog-shrouded town seems to transport them (along with police officer Cybil Bennett) to a new monstrous dimension. Meanwhile, after the mother and daughter have been gone for a few hours, Rose\u2019s husband, Christopher, sets off to Silent Hill to find his family.\nInside the town is where Silent Hill takes the most inspiration from the video game series it\u2019s based on. Some of Silent Hill\u2019s most recognizable enemies and monsters show up, chasing Cybil, Sharon, and Rose through the town and eventually into the iconic Pyramid Head. These segments are impressively scary, and steeped in the dreadful atmosphere that made the games famous.\nBut even beyond the terrifying town itself, the best part of Silent Hill comes when Christopher arrives. Rather than managing to find his family, all he finds is an abandoned mining town. For most of the movie, the women\u2019s frantic running and hiding from monsters is paralleled by Christopher wandering around the exact same areas, filled with a dreadful sense that his family is close, but completely unable to see them or the horrors threatening to kill them. It\u2019s not a subtle metaphor for the differences in the ways that men and women go through the world, but it is an effective one, and it manages to create a level of crushing existential terror and defeat that few movies ever come close to. \u2014AG\nOct. 21: Suspiria (2018)\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, Freevee\nDario Argento\u2019s 1977 Suspiria is a horror masterpiece, the sort of film even the best directors would face insurmountable odds of matching with a remake. The story \u2014 an American ballerina who moves to Germany to attend a prestigious ballet company, only to be greeted by a series of murders and a supernatural mystery \u2014 is a vessel for Argento\u2019s craft, featuring some of his boldest visuals and some truly nauseating body horror.\nSo how, then, did Luca Guadagnino do the impossible, creating its contemporary equal?\nHe cast Tilda Swinton in multiple roles and Mia Goth to do the Mia Goth thing. For cinematography, he brought on Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, known for Guadagnino\u2019s own Call Me By Your Name, but also Apichatpong Weerasethakul\u2019s seminal indie films Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives and Memoria. And for the score: Thom Yorke. Yes, Radiohead Thom Yorke.\nWhere other directors would have obsessively recreated a source text, rebooting it into something unrecognizable, Guadagnino\u2019s film is an homage \u2014 the sort of movie you imagine Argento would make with the budgets and creative freedom afforded by tech companies trying to buy cultural capital. It\u2019s more political. More grotesque. The ending is just more.\nThe truth is 2018\u2019s Suspiria and the original Suspiria should be enjoyed together. In the past, that\u2019s been a challenge, with the original film being surprisingly difficult to watch \u2014 especially if you prefer streaming. But this month, Criterion Collection has you covered, allowing for one of the most batshit double features of your life. \u2014CP\nOct. 22: Pan\u2019s Labyrinth\nWhere to watch: Available to purchase on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\nNot just a great horror movie, but one of the Great Movies, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth is among the best examples of a fairy tale for adults. Set during the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth follows Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) after her pregnant mother takes her to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi L\u00f3pez) \u2014 a fascist Falangista hunting down the republican rebels that are hiding out in the Spanish forest.\nIn this terrifying time, Ofelia encounters a faun, a mythical creature that claims she is the reincarnated Princess Moanna, daughter of the king of the underworld. The Faun (Doug Jones) tells her that if she completes three tasks, she can return to the king and queen and live forever as princess of the underworld.\nLike many folk tales before they\u2019re sterilized by pop culture, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth is a fairy tale full of menace, danger, and horror \u2014 but also hope. It is both a refuge from a turbulent time and an attempt to understand it, a parable that becomes timeless in its specificity with new meaning to discover every time it\u2019s revisited. Widely considered to be writer-director Guillermo del Toro\u2019s magnum opus, it shows the director operating at the peak of his powers, with lavish production design, evocative colors, and naturalistic performances juxtaposed with quiet, dangerous magic.\nBut what makes it a great film is astonishingly simple. Some movies endeavor to make sure you understand them. The best ones help you understand yourself. Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, in the end, wants to know what kind of person you are by the time the credits roll. \u2014Joshua Rivera\nOct. 23: Eyes Without a Face\nWhere to watch: Criterion Channel, Max\nThe late 1950s weren\u2019t exactly a booming era for French horror films. While Henri-Georges Clouzot\u2019s psychological thriller Diabolique received an effusive reception upon its release in 1955, the prevailing attitude of French critics at the time was that horror was antithetical to the high-minded standard of what French cinema should aspire to. Eyes Without a Face bucked against this perception, taking what would otherwise be a standard mad scientist tale and turning it into a dark horror fable about love, guilt, and madness.\nThe film follows Dr. G\u00e9nessier, a renowned plastic surgeon wracked with guilt over a car accident that disfigured his beloved daughter Christiane\u2019s face. Faking her death and confining her to the grounds of his mansion, G\u00e9nessier devises a desperate and horrifying scheme: Perform a series of skin grafts to repair Christiane\u2019s face using the faces of abducted women who resemble her. With the failure of each attempt, the body count begins to rise, prompting the authorities to mount a desperate manhunt to apprehend the culprit. In the midst of all of this, Christiane herself grows tired of her father\u2019s obsession, wishing instead to reunite with her lover Jacques and resume her life.\nFantastical and atmospheric, Eyes Without a Face is a beautiful horror thriller with masterful cinematography courtesy of Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan (who previously worked on Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis) and a memorable score composed by Maurice-Alexis Jarre, who would later go on to win an Academy Award for his work on Lawrence of Arabia. If you\u2019re looking for an intelligent and gorgeous horror movie that still manages to dabble in its share of gore, Georges Franju\u2019s masterpiece is a must-watch. \u2014TE\nOct. 24: Overlord\nWhere to watch: Paramount Plus, Pluto TV\nThis slept-on genre-mashing gem takes a cast of excellent actors about to do bigger things (Jovan Adepo, Wyatt Russell, John Magaro, Pilou Asb\u00e6k, and more), and an up-and-coming director (The Pope\u2019s Exorcist\u2019s Julius Avery) and places them behind Nazi lines during World War II. The Nazis are up to more than usual this time: There be zombies in these labs.\nOn the eve of D-Day, a group of Allied paratroopers are sent into Germany on a covert mission. Things go wrong instantly when their plane crashes, and they soon discover twisted Nazi experiments after connecting with the residents. Things get bloody fast, with great action from second unit director Shaun O\u2019Dell (The Woman King, Brotherhood of the Wolf) and stunt coordinator Jo McLaren (Heart of Stone).\nOverlord is a gleeful, intentionally ridiculous Nazi-zombie-bashing time, with tight direction and a fantastic group of actors. If you love the Wolfenstein games or Call of Duty\u2019s Zombies mode, or B-movies with A-movie production, this one is for you. \u2014PV\nOct. 25: Curve\nWhere to watch: YouTube\nTim Egan\u2019s 2016 horror short inspires the same visceral physical response as watching an episode of Squid Game. A young woman wakes to discover her twisted body perched precariously on the slope of a strange cliff overlooking a bottomless pit. Her hands caked with blood, the woman attempts to inch herself away from the pit, each desperate motion teetering on the cusp of survival and oblivion. Will she be able to escape where so many others have failed?\nCurve works as a horror short because it leaves so much to the imagination. We don\u2019t know who this woman is, how she ended up in this situation, or what the purpose of this place even is. In the presence of imminent horror, our first instinct is to scramble for answers and, in the absence of any to be found, our second instinct is to search for a means of escape. Through a captivating lead performance and deft sound design, Egan delivers a gripping horror story in just under 10 minutes. \u2014TE\nOct. 26: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\nWhere to watch: Max\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a nauseating smoothie of rural horror, outr\u00e9 indie experimentation, and wannabe snuff film. Its murders aren\u2019t real, but you\u2019d be forgiven for being convinced the film\u2019s actors are in genuine trouble; from the budget film stock to the filthy sets, it all feels\u2026 off. The result is not just a great horror flick, but a monumental work that originated many tropes of its genre and, most recently, earned a coveted spot in the Sight and Sound list of the greatest films of all time.\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is nothing like that. You won\u2019t see its name in a film school syllabus, and the films it inspired can be counted on one hand. Nonetheless, there\u2019s something commendable about the gall of Tobe Hooper, the original Texas Chain Saw director, returning to his series with the energy of a middle-aged man on his first ayahuasca retreat.\nLeatherface gets in a high-speed car battle, eventually standing on the roof of a speeding sedan. Dennis Hopper dual-wields chainsaws. A radio station office is obliterated like it\u2019s a novelty rage room. Sometimes you want a steak, and sometimes you want a hamburger. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a damn juicy burger. \u2014CP\nOct. 27: Possessor\nWhere to watch: Hulu\nMy first Brandon Cronenberg (yes, David\u2019s son) movie was Infinity Pool, his latest messed-up meditation on the rich and powerful. I vividly remember telling friends how exciting and debauched the movie was, and their response surprised me: \u201cClearly you haven\u2019t seen Possessor.\u201d\nThat night, I rectified this, and dear readers: They were right. As disturbing and mystifying as I found the world of Infinity Pool, Possessor was all that and more. And I haven\u2019t been able to get it out of my brain since. Which is\u2026 fitting, considering the movie.\nAndrea Riseborough (Mandy, To Leslie) plays an elite corporate assassin who is able to inhabit other people\u2019s bodies, getting closer to her victims by posing as people already in their lives. It\u2019s a haunting premise, and one Possessor takes full advantage of, both in the moments of action and in the assassin\u2019s contemplation about what her identity truly even is.\nPossessor is an unforgettable entry into the psychological horror canon, and it brings a little sci-fi into your Halloween celebrations. Don\u2019t miss it. \u2014PV\nOct. 28: Opera\nWhere to watch: Shudder, Tubi, Vudu\nYou can\u2019t get more than five minutes into a conversation about Italian horror without mentioning Dario Argento, the giallo master.\nOpera represents the last hurrah of Argento\u2019s hot streak throughout the \u201970s and \u201980s. It\u2019s an extravagant horror-thriller that combines high-minded aesthetics with the viscerality of slasher cinema. The film follows Betty, the understudy to a famous opera singer, who is selected to play the role of Lady Macbeth after the star suffers a terrible accident. While preparing for her first big performance, Betty is subjected to a terrifying ordeal when she is attacked by a mysterious unseen assailant who tapes needles under her eyes and forces her to watch as her boyfriend is mutilated. Barely escaping with her life, Betty seeks the aid of Marco, the play\u2019s director, in apprehending the culprit before they can claim another victim.\nVery loosely based on Argento\u2019s own experience directing a failed production of Verdi\u2019s Macbeth, Opera is a sumptuous and suspenseful slasher that holds the viewer\u2019s attention and absolutely refuses to let go. Like Betty, one feels compelled to watch this macabre display of ritualistic horror play out to its conclusion in a desperate search of answers. Fortunately, unlike Betty, you won\u2019t have to worry about losing your eyes if you find yourself overwhelmed by the frights. \u2014TE\nOct. 29: House of 1000 Corpses\nWhere to watch: AMC Plus, Pluto TV, Tubi\nHouse of 1000 Corpses may be the true answer to the question \u201cWhat is the best The Texas Chain Saw Massacre sequel?\u201d\nThe movie follows a group of teens who are putting together a book on roadside attractions when they stumble upon a serial killer-themed rest stop run by a weirdo. After their strange encounter, the kids set off on the road, only for their car to break down a few miles later. Thankfully, their helpful hitchhiker companion Baby knows just the place they can get help: the Firefly mansion, where her family lives. From there, things devolve into a host of horrific stage plays, cursed experiments, and gruesome murders.\nThe family at its center, whom Rob Zombie went on to make two more movies about, is repulsive and absolutely horrible, but still zany enough to be truly unsettling in a way that few horror movies can be. House of 1000 Corpses is a grisly, grotesque film that captures all the grime of the \u201970s movies that inspired it. But what really makes it worth watching is the way it balances silliness and terror, doling each out in proportional quantities until you can\u2019t figure out if you should laugh or scream. Instead, you just end up doing both. \u2014AG\nOct. 30: Thirst\nWhere to watch: Peacock\nPark Chan-wook has never missed. And Thirst, his most overt foray into horror, may also be his steamiest movie (a high bar, considering the excellent The Handmaiden).\nFrequent Park collaborator Song Kang-ho stars as a Catholic priest who volunteers for a medical experiment. The experiment instead turns him into a vampire, giving him a lust for blood\u2026 and also for the wife of an old friend.\nIn many ways, this movie is in close relationship to his two most recent releases \u2014 The Handmaiden and Decision to Leave. It pairs the eroticism of the former with the charged relationship dynamic of the latter, to gripping effect. With Park\u2019s typical attention to detail and eye for arresting images (as well as his wicked sense of humor), Thirst is an unconventional and sexy Halloween watch. \u2014PV\nOct. 31: The Exorcist III\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, Criterion Channel\nNearly 50 years since it was first released in theaters, William Friedkin\u2019s The Exorcist has withstood the test of time as one of the most terrifying and influential horror films in American cinema. The sequel that came closest to capturing that same lightning in a bottle is The Exorcist III, written and directed by William Peter Blatty, the original screenwriter of the first film and author of the novel on which it was based.\nWhen a series of gruesome murders matching the modus operandi of an infamous serial killer begins to terrorize the city of Georgetown, Lt. William F. Kinderman (George C. Scott) investigates the psych ward of a local hospital in search of leads. Confronted with a suspect whose appearance matches that of his late friend Father Damien Karras, Kinderman finds himself thrust into a battle for his very soul as he confronts an evil beyond his comprehension.\nThe story of The Exorcist III\u2019s production is a tangled mess of false starts, studio interference, and thwarted artistic ambitions. Though it was originally conceived with Friedkin in mind to return as director, he eventually left the project due to creative differences with Blatty. John Carpenter was at one time tapped to direct, before he too stepped aside to allow Blatty himself to take the reins. Morgan Creek Productions, which financed the film, demanded Blatty reshoot the film\u2019s final act, which originally ended without an exorcism. Even given these complications, The Exorcist III remains a fascinating and terrifying film in its own right, with a hodgepodge of fascinating creative choices and literary dialogue that makes the film feel like a sister piece to Blatty\u2019s The Ninth Configuration. It may not have been the Exorcist sequel that audiences at the time wanted, but it\u2019s still a damn fine picture. \u2014TE\n\nThis article, authored by Toussaint Egan, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-10 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":165}

Signings such as Dani Olmo, Christopher Nkunku and Amadou Haidara again showcased what Mitchell can do with the shackles off, and again the results followed.\n6 Getting Nkunku from PSG was one of Mitchell's biggest coups Credit: Getty\nMany of his signings starred in a run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2020, and in 2022 won the club\u2019s first ever trophy with a DFB Pokal.\nOnly leaving the side to reach the pinnacle of his job, finally stepping up from a head of recruitment to become sporting director at Monaco, Mitchell showed just how big picture he is with an interview in 2021.\n\u201cI want to continue to drive standards in each and every department,\u201d he said. \u201cPsychology, sports science, nutrition, medicine, the way we travel, the way we refuel.\n\u201cEverything, every element I think we need to keep pushing to its maximum to try and be the best we possibly can.\u201d\nHaving worked in football management for over a decade, Mitchell\u2019s career has always been about the long term for his club\u2019s, with the young signings he\u2019s made often only paying off after he\u2019s left.\nOne in particular was 2022\/23 Premier League top scorer Son, who perfectly sums up his philosophy.\n\u201cI took quite a lot of criticism in my first year at Tottenham for some of the decisions and Sonny was kind of at the centre of that,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cSometimes players need time, they\u2019re human beings, they need to settle, Sonny had a great track record at Hamburg and Leverkusen but there was this narrative that started to grow internally and externally that he wasn\u2019t a good finisher.\n6 Mitchell is becoming an increasingly recognisable face\n\u201cI remember telling a coach \u2018you\u2019re wrong, his history shows in two different clubs he\u2019s a very astute finisher off both sides\u2019.\u201d\nMitchell remains good friends with Rangnick from their time together at Leipzig, and last season made headlines when he was spotted at a youth team game while the German was interim coach at Man United.\nSo astute is Mitchell in his observations, he even laid out a blueprint for United's success while at Monaco.\n\u201cI think context is important to measure what Manchester United's current situation is, but I think they do need to get to the point of really putting down what Manchester United needs to be in the modern game,\u201d he explained.\n\"We are a long time from the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Erik ten Hag is a top coach from Ajax but they need a top blueprint not only for now but for the next five years, and work towards that, and sometimes on that journey there are hard moments when you don't get the right results, even though you're doing the right things.\n\"You have to know that, over that period, the consistency of the decision-making will yield a good end result. I think we've seen that both Manchester City and Liverpool, that when you adopt that long-term strategy you can get real consistency and sustainable success.\n\"I think that's the biggest thing for Manchester United; putting down their identity of what they want to be today, but most crucially what they want to be in five years' time, and where they want to be, and what they want to look like; from everything from young players, to the style of play, to the whole culture peace in Manchester United.\"\nAlmost certain to consult Rangnick before any approach from Ratcliffe, Mitchell may be warned off of a club where long-term thinking hasn\u2019t existed.\nBut, should Ratcliffe get his man, it could signal exactly the change in fortunes he and every supporter has been hoping for at Manchester United.\n\nThis article, authored by Connor Andrews, was published by TalkSport on 2023-10-16 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":166}

Joe Marler starts ahead of vice-captain Ellis Genge at loosehead prop, and Ollie Chessum is replaced in the second-row by George Martin.

The contribution of backs Kurt-Lee Arendse, Damian de Allende and Cheslin Kolbe saw all three cross for first-half tries, with Kolbe's coming off the back of a charged-down conversion from France's Thomas Ramos. Preventing those two points proved crucial in the end.\nThe key contribution, though, came from Eben Etzebeth, who bulldozed his way over to score the only five-pointer of the second half and wrestle the game back into South African hands. He and Franco Mostert pack down together in the second row, while hooker Bongi Mbonambi, utility Deon Fourie, veteran Duane Vermeulen and the devilish Kwagga Smith will all be looking to back up superb quarter-final performances to take the Springboks to a second consecutive World Cup final.\nSouth Africa starting XV: Damian Willemse, Kurt-Lee Arendse, Jesse Kriel, Damian de Allende, Cheslin Kolbe, Manie Libbok, Cobus Reinach; Steven Kitshoff, Bongi Mbonambi, Frans Malherbe, Eben Etzebeth, Franco Mostert, Siya Kolisi, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Duane Vermeulen.\nSouth Africa replacements: Deon Fourie, Ox Nche, Vincent Koch, RG Snyman, Kwagga Smith, Faf de Klerk, Handre Pollard, Willie le Roux.\nEngland vs. South Africa betting odds, prediction\nThe last time these two sides met was a tumultuous period to say the least, particularly for English rugby. South Africa's dominant 27-13 victory at Twickenham proved to be the last game in charge for Eddie Jones, the coach who had taken England to the 2019 World Cup final. In his place, Steve Borthwick was hired, and he's just one game away from repeating that feat.\nEngland's form at this tournament has been perfect \u2014 at face value. Argentina, Japan, Chile, Samoa and Fiji have all provided highlights \u2014 Los Pumas are also in the semi-finals \u2014 and England have beaten all of them. However, only Japan and Chile were defeated with bonus points, and the narrow wins over both Samoa and Fiji in their last two games showed that England are certainly gettable.\nIn short, this semi-final requires a huge step up in quality for Borthwick's side, and that's why we think that the Springboks will be victorious at the Stade de France. South Africa have already shown they can match, and beat, the world's best, and we think that they'll do the latter in Saint-Denis.\n\nThis article, authored by Jonathan Burnett, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-20 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":167}

{"title":"Steam Deck OLED review: It's just better","context":"## Steam Deck OLED review: It's just better\n\nThe first thing to know about the Steam Deck OLED is that it\u2019s not the Steam Deck 2. The Steam Deck OLED is a mid-cycle refresh from Valve, similar to the Switch OLED upgrade, but there\u2019s a lot more going on internally here. Its screen is better, its battery life is better, its thumbsticks are better, the haptics are better, and its chip and thermals are better. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed is its form factor \u2014 this is still one of the biggest babies on the handheld block.\nThe new Steam Deck\u2019s main upgrade is its OLED screen, which replaces the original LCD and, crucially, has native support for HDR and faster frame rates. The OLED also has smaller bezels, making the display larger at 7.4 inches, compared with the original 7-inch screen.\nValve Valve Steam Deck OLED SCORE 89 Engadget 89 Critics - Not yet scored N\/A Users - Not yet scored N\/A Pros Improved battery life\nBright and smooth visuals\nBetter thermals\nFeels less top-heavy\nLong charging cable Cons Still ridiculously large\nSeriously it\u2019s so big\nValve Valve Steam Deck OLED This isn't the Steam Deck 2 some are waiting for, it's just a welcome improvement on an already good device. $549 at Steam\nOLED screen\nThe HDR OLED display looks fantastic. It features a wider P3 color gamut, pure blacks and a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, compared with the original max of 400 nits. In action, this means the screen\u2019s bezels meld with the black of any game, creating a more polished frame for retro aspect ratios and providing room for higher-contrast colors. The screen on the new model doesn\u2019t support variable refresh rates (VRR), but it now tops out at 90Hz, while the original could only hit 60Hz. The updated display is smooth, crisp and bright, like a perfect lemon tart. (Even then, I do not recommend licking the screen.)\nBattery life\nOne of the downsides of the first Steam Deck was its short battery life, which maxed out at eight hours, and that was only under ideal conditions. Valve says the new Steam Deck battery will last 30 to 50 percent longer, depending on how you\u2019re playing, and it charges faster \u2014 the company claims it will go from 20 percent to 80 percent in 45 minutes.\nCustom AMD APU\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a die-shrunk version of the custom AMD APU found in the original Steam Deck \u2014 same CPU and GPU, just more efficient. This is the process Sony takes advantage of to build the PS4 Slim and PS5 Slim, but instead of collapsing the Steam Deck around smaller hardware, Valve chose to add a bigger battery and larger fan to its existing chassis. For developers, this means the device has the same performance targets as the original and there\u2019s no need to create games specifically for the new hardware. In the end, the device weighs about 30 grams less than the original model, or the equivalent of five quarters.\nEngadget\nIn use\nWhich leads us to the bad news for my tiny hand gang. The Steam Deck OLED is the same monstrous size as the original: 11.7 inches long, 4.5 inches tall and nearly 2 inches thick. The thumbsticks on the new model are actually 1mm taller than the first version. This was one of my main complaints about the Steam Deck when I first reviewed it: I have smaller-than-average hands, and the Steam Deck looks and feels absolutely ridiculous when I\u2019m holding it. It\u2019s just massive, no matter how long my manicure gets. However, the OLED model feels more balanced than the original. It\u2019s less top-heavy, and it does technically weigh less. These small adjustments have made a noticeable difference during my playtime, and the device feels slightly more manageable as a handheld \u2014 or maybe I\u2019m just too distracted by all of its bright, pretty colors to care about the cramping in my palms.\nThe thumbsticks on the new handheld have an improved texture that shouldn\u2019t turn gray after a few months\u2019 use, and they feel perfectly serviceable. In my hands-on time so far, I've found that the OLED touchscreen responds immediately to input, and the haptic feedback on the built-in trackpads feels even more precise, populating in reactive pin-pricks under the textured plastic.\nI spent a few cozy nights on my couch swapping between the LCD and OLED Steam Decks, and honestly, after I\u2019m done with this review, I\u2019ll probably retire my original model. The Steam Deck OLED is sharper and more responsive; indie games, AAA games and plain old Steam menus look so much better on the new hardware.\nEngadget\nHades is my most-played game on the original Steam Deck, so I used that to test out Valve\u2019s battery life claims. Though it doesn\u2019t support HDR, a game like Hades pops on the OLED, and its animations look more fluid than on the LCD version. The OLED lasted four hours and 23 minutes before dying. With the same settings (800p with a 60 fps cap and similar brightness) the original model died after two hours and 42 minutes. That\u2019s a 62 percent improvement, surpassing Valve\u2019s own estimates, though batteries degrade and I\u2019ve had my LCD Steam Deck since the device\u2019s launch in early 2022. In a stress test that involved playing Elden Ring with everything maxed out, the OLED battery lasted two hours and 20 minutes, about 40 percent longer than the original.\nPlaying the Steam Decks back-to-back highlighted another significant quality-of-life improvement: heat management. My palms have gotten toasty playing the OLED model, but they haven\u2019t broken a sweat like they often do with the original. The new fan may be larger, but it\u2019s not any louder, and it clearly works a treat.\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a new Wi-Fi 6E module and improved antennas that should enable faster downloads for anyone with a compatible router. I don\u2019t have a 6E router or multi-gigabit Wi-Fi, but with a regular Wi-Fi 6 router, the top download speed I saw on the new Steam Deck was 562mbps, which was about 10 percent faster than the old Steam Deck, and 10 percent slower than the speeds I get on my MacBook Pro. The device uses Bluetooth 5.3 and adds a dedicated antenna, which should improve functionality when using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth at the same time.\nEngadget\nEven with improvements to the battery, thermals and weight distribution, the Steam Deck OLED is still more of a Wii U than a Vita. It\u2019s a beast of a handheld, and it makes the most sense as a portable console to use around the house, rather than a truly travel-ready device. The new model even comes with an extra-long, 2.5m charging cable, designed specifically with couch-based players in mind. I didn\u2019t test out the docking station with the new Steam Deck, but Valve recently released a SteamOS update that lets players take advantage of HDR and VRR on external displays, which only drives home the Wii U-ness of it all.\nAs far as software, you know the drill by now. Valve has rolled out labels for Steam games signifying how well they\u2019ll work on the handheld, with four levels: unknown, unsupported, playable and verified. Playable games generally come with a small caveat, like having to deploy the on-screen keyboard, while verified games have been fully optimized for portable play. Currently, more than 10,000 titles on Steam fall under the playable or verified labels, with more added every day.\nWhen will the Steam Deck OLED be available?\nThe Steam Deck OLED will go on sale on November 16th at 1pm ET, and Valve has units ready to ship that same day. The company has lowered the price of its LCD lineup and will sell through its backstock of 64GB and 512GB models until they\u2019re all gone. It\u2019ll continue selling the 256GB LCD model at a reduced price of $400, while the 512GB OLED model will cost $550 and the 1TB OLED model will cost $650. There\u2019s also a limited edition 1TB OLED version priced at $680 that comes with a special carrying case, a translucent gray body and orange accents.\nValve\nWrap-up\nAccording to the developers I spoke with at Valve, this is the definitive version of the Steam Deck. The HDR OLED model is what they would have released the first time around, if the technology had existed before 2022. The handheld market has evolved quickly \u2014 in just over a year, the Steam Deck proved there\u2019s widespread demand for handheld PCs, and its success helped drive chip makers and display manufacturers to build hardware specifically for high-fidelity mobile play. This is great news for Valve and the Steam Deck, and also the other handhelds coming out of companies like Ayaneo, ASUS, Ayn, Logitech, Retroid and Razer. Hell, maybe even Playdate will get an HDR OLED display one day. (Just kidding; Playdate is literally perfect).\nSo, no, the HDR OLED refresh isn't the Steam Deck 2, but it is a welcome improvement on an already good device. The Steam Deck OLED is the facetuned, photoshopped, spit-shined version of Valve\u2019s handheld, and it features tangible, clever improvements. The updated display is the highlight of the device, while things like faster charging, improved antennas and smoother haptics are welcome bonuses. More importantly, this is Valve renewing its commitment to portable PC gaming, and that\u2019s a relief to see. The Steam Deck is the granddaddy of handheld PCs and Valve has the resources to continue innovating in this space. For now, the OLED model is a half-step toward the Steam Deck 2, which may be the final version of the device \u2014 unless Valve finally learns how to count to three.\n\nThis article, authored by Jessica Conditt, was published by Engadget on 2023-11-09 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":169}
{"title":"Tim Sweeney on Epic\u2019s victory royale over Google","context":"## Tim Sweeney on Epic\u2019s victory royale over Google\n\nTim Sweeney finally has a win.\nOn Monday, a federal jury surprised the world by siding with Fortnite maker Epic Games in its fight to break Google\u2019s control over Android apps \u2014 even though \u201cwalled garden\u201d rival Apple almost entirely won a similar case two years ago. The nine-person jury decided that Google has an illegal monopoly over Android app distribution and in-app payment systems, and that Google illegally tied its Google Play billing system to its app store.\nSweeney is Epic\u2019s CEO, co-founder, and importantly its controlling shareholder. He\u2019s the one behind these lawsuits, and it was his idea to challenge these companies in court. It\u2019s been his fight from the very beginning, and he watched almost the entire trial in person from the best seat in the house \u2014 with a clear view of the jury, the judge, each witness, and the faces of Google\u2019s lawyers.\nLast night, I asked him why, what he learned, and what\u2019s next.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\nThank you for being here with us. It\u2019s been a very engaging trial to watch. I\u2019ve been there every day of the trial, and you\u2019ve been there every day save one. So my first question is why did you personally attend this trial every day save one \u2014 and what the heck happened on that one day?\nYeah, Epic is asking a lot of the court system and the jury here, spending four weeks on a major antitrust trial full of complicated facts and evidence. It wouldn\u2019t be right to start something like this and not show up. So I had to do that. And, you know, Phil Schiller sat throughout the entire Epic v. Apple trial, as did I, so I think it\u2019s just necessary to show respect for the legal process.\nWhat happened on that one day you weren\u2019t here?\nOh \u2014 sorry I can\u2019t share, but there were some... non-Epic issues I had to deal with.\nSo this trial has been four years in the making. I look back at a September 2019 email that was in discovery about a plan to draw Google into a legal battle over antitrust. Can you describe what it felt like, after four years, to hear the jury find for Epic?\nWell, it\u2019s a great day for all developers to see that the Sherman Antitrust Act works in the new era of tech monopolies; we\u2019ve not had a major antitrust verdict against a tech company that meant change and benefits for everybody since the 1990s, with the US v. Microsoft. Back in the early days of the internet. So this is an awesome thing and it\u2019s much needed by the industry which is being strangled by a few gatekeepers imposing insane amounts of control and extracting huge taxes, which not only raise prices for consumers but also make a lot of kinds of products just unviable.\nI understand the significance, but... you were there in person. You had a smile on your face, you shook the Google attorney\u2019s hand, you clapped Bornstein on the back. How did you feel in that moment?\nWell, it was a great relief. The conventional wisdom that attorneys tell you is that when there\u2019s a rapid jury verdict, it\u2019s typically not good for the plaintiffs making a complicated case, and so there was some trepidation going on \u2014 but it was awesome to see.\nSomething that we\u2019d suspected all along was the jury was really following the case carefully. They weren\u2019t snoozing off as you might expect with the complexity of these documents and things \u2014 everybody was paying attention, they\u2019re looking at the question asker and the witness and taking notes and reading documents. It was just awesome to see that the justice system works, even with the most complex type of tech antitrust case that you can possibly throw at a jury.\n[Editor\u2019s note: Every journalist in the courtroom agreed the jury was attentive; most were also surprised by the rapid verdict.]\nThey got it, they got it quickly, and they were able to pull apart what was going on and contrast it with the fiction of the story that Google was trying to tell.\nWhat was something that surprised you in the courtroom, something you heard come to light that you hadn\u2019t heard before?\nI\u2019d suspected a lot of the practices that Google had, you know, since 2018 or so when we first started this, to such an extent that some folks would occasionally call me a conspiracy theorist. It was really, really interesting to see that my understandings of what Google was doing behind the scenes were actually true \u2014 you\u2019re leaking our conversations to reporters to get negative stories written about us; you\u2019re paying other developers off to convince them not to launch their own stores; they were going around and paying carriers and OEMs secretly not to carry competing stores.\nAnd when we tried to bundle Fortnite with other smartphone manufacturers like OnePlus and carriers of all sorts, they told us they couldn\u2019t do a deal because Google had done a secret deal with them.\nIt was really disconcerting to see the extent of bad faith efforts that were going on in a company of Google\u2019s size. You\u2019d think a trillion-dollar company would develop to the point where they have pretty respectable processes and leadership structures that provide a check and balance against wrongdoing, but they were rampantly destroying all their chats on these topics.\nYou\u2019d see long conversation threads would start to get into a spicy antitrust issue, and suddenly somebody points out the history\u2019s on and the chat goes silent. They just turned it off to have the documents destroyed. It was great to see that all called out in detail.\nAny particular evidence where you\u2019re like, \u201cOh wow, I never saw that, and now that specific thing came out for the world to see\u201d?\nAs an employee of Epic, I\u2019ve not been able to see Google\u2019s internal documents until the trial started. The lawyers can see them, but I saw almost all the key elements in this case at the same time the jury saw them. Two things stand out big time. Google\u2019s Project Hug was an astonishingly corrupt effort at a massive scale \u2014 the same corrupt deal structure they tried to do with Epic when they wanted to pay us off to launch Fortnite on Google Play and not launch our own store.\nAs soon as we thwarted their effort, they went around to 27 different developers and offered each one a payoff to undermine any effort we had to get their games onto our store exclusively. Activision and Riot and Supercell had direct distribution plans that they were planning on; Google paid them not to pursue those plans. Just direct blatant violations of anti-competition law, it\u2019s crazy a company of Google\u2019s scale would do that.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller developer than Spotify, you get screwed.\u201d\nThe other astonishing one was the Spotify deal. Spotify is the one company that had comparable negotiating power to Fortnite. Instead of using their power to fight for the good of all developers, they did a special deal with Google. Google gave them a 0 percent fee. Google let Spotify process their own payments, and Spotify kept 100 percent. They do it for Spotify and for nobody else. If you\u2019re a smaller developer than Spotify, you get screwed.\nWhen Spotify uses Google\u2019s own payment service, instead of paying the 30 percent that Google forces other developers to pay, they pay 4 percent. That\u2019s what the rate should be! Four percent is a perfectly reasonable rate for an unbundled payment system.\nIf instead of offering you a $147 million deal, Google said, \u201cYou can pay 0 percent to use your own payments system or 4 percent for Google Play billing,\u201d would you be here today? Would you have fought this lawsuit to begin with if they\u2019d simply offered something more fair to you?\nNo, we\u2019ve always turned down special deals just for Epic. We\u2019ve always fought on the principal that all developers should be, you know, given the same opportunities. One of the documents in evidence was a 2019 email I sent \u2014 right before Fortnite launched the Marvel season with all this amazing new content and the Star Wars event featuring J.J. Abrams. Right before that, I sent an email to all the Google senior executives saying that we wanted to bring Fortnite to the Google Play Store in time for that event, and we wanted them to allow us and all other developers to process certain payments and keep them all.\nThat was our proposal to Google in 2019. If Google had said yes to that, that would have been awesome for all developers \u2014 the Android ecosystem would have become much, much stronger, and Google would be in a much better position in the smartphone industry than they are today. We would\u2019ve never had a dispute because the problem would have been solved.\nIt\u2019s always been in Google\u2019s power to solve this problem. They make several billion dollars a year in unfairly earned profits from imposing this tax, which is nothing compared to the money they make from search. For all the other benefits they get from Android, Google could solve this problem today if they wanted to.\nDo you today believe that Activision Blizzard was really intending to build its own app store?\nI don\u2019t know about Supercell, but we know from the documents in the case that Riot was planning to distribute League of Legends directly through their website, on mobile, exactly as they do on PC. And that\u2019s what they planned to do until Google paid them off to not do that. Google\u2019s payoff at the minimum dissuaded Riot from distributing off Google Play.\nI think they\u2019re the strongest example of the three, but I\u2019m curious about Activision.\nActivision was building a store! We know they had a large team of dozens of engineers building a mobile app store to launch on Android.\nWe know that because they came to us and told us they were doing that. And we know it because after all that went down, I talked to an Activision employee who was close to that effort, working with the team building the store, and he reported that the entire store team Activision had employed to build their competing store had been disbanded as soon as Activision signed their deal with Google.\n[Editor\u2019s note: We did not hear from such a person at trial; I\u2019d be eager to speak to them now!]\nWe know Activision was telling Google they were building their computing store; we know in Google internal discussions they said they didn\u2019t want Activision building a competing store. They agreed to sign this deal, and they were gleeful about the fact they dissuaded perhaps their number one competitor at the time from launching their own store.\nFour years later, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard \u2014 and one of the big talking points from Microsoft to the European Union was that the merger strengthened the company overall in order to provide a viable computing store on iOS and Android.\nWhat would you say the differences are between the Apple and Google cases?\nI would say Apple was ice and Google was fire.\nThe thing with Apple is all of their antitrust trickery is internal to the company. They use their store, their payments, they force developers to all have the same terms, they force OEMs and carriers to all have the same terms.\nWhereas Google, to achieve things with Android, they were going around and paying off game developers, dozens of game developers, to not compete. And they\u2019re paying off dozens of carriers and OEMs to not compete \u2014 and when all of these different companies do deals together, lots of people put things in writing, and it\u2019s right there for everybody to read and to see plainly.\nI think the Apple case would be no less interesting if we could see all of their internal thoughts and deliberations, but Apple was not putting it in writing, whereas Google was. You know, I think Apple is... it\u2019s a little bit unfortunate that in a lot of ways Apple\u2019s restrictions on competition are absolute. Thou shalt not have a competing store on iOS and thou shalt not use a competing payment method. And I think Apple should be receiving at least as harsh antitrust scrutiny as Google.\nIt\u2019s interesting to me that because Google distributes the Android operating system as open source, they had to put all these deals out in the open. More out in the open, I should say \u2014 certainly they still wanted to keep them secret.\nBut I\u2019m going down my story about all the best emails from the Epic v. Apple trial \u2014 and we do have a lot of documents from both Apple and Google that show they were similarly self-serving in terms of deals.\nI\u2019d say this is the thing that\u2019s disappointed me the most with Apple and Google: even at the peak of the antitrust trial against Microsoft, Microsoft was awesome to developers. Microsoft has always been awesome to developers, always being respectful, giving developers a great deal and treating them as partners, you know? And so even as Microsoft was crushing corporate competitors, the developer experience was excellent. [Editor\u2019s note: Netscape might feel differently.]\n\u201cEven as Microsoft was crushing corporate competitors, the developer experience was excellent.\u201d\nGoogle and Apple both treat developers as adversaries \u2014 they try to attack our revenue streams and prevent us from competing with their products. They\u2019ve built these massive self-preferencing schemes all around excluding developers and disadvantaging third-party developers. I think this is very shortsighted. I think any tech company \u2014 Apple, Google included \u2014 would be much better off in the long term if they viewed developers as awesome partners and did everything they could to support them and empower them and not get in their way financially.\nAnd this has been our philosophy with Unreal Engine, for example, and the Epic Games Store. We just want to be a cool partner that helps other companies succeed the way we do. And I think philosophy change... perhaps it will only come with a generational change in the company\u2019s management. I think the philosophy change would do both of those companies much good.\nIf you get your way in terms of being able to freely put your own store on Android, do you believe that would only be a game store or would it also be an app store? We look at Valve and we see a store that could be both, but they\u2019ve decided to focus exclusively on games.\nSo the Epic Games Store isn\u2019t a games store, right? It\u2019s the store operated by Epic Games. So we have a lot of non-games there already. We have the Brave web browser, we have a number of software creation tools including Unreal Engine, and there\u2019s more coming, including some other awesome creation tools and productivity tools. We\u2019ll host any app anybody wants of any sort.\nI think the gaming market is something we\u2019re uniquely close to, and so I think we would likely be able to forge closer partnerships and opportunities in gaming, but we\u2019ll be open to everybody on Android as we are on PC.\nWhat were your settlement talks with Google CEO Sundar Pichai like?\nWe can\u2019t talk about content, but we met for an hour and had a professional discussion... in which we didn\u2019t reach a settlement. We were rather far apart, let\u2019s say, because what Epic wants ultimately is free competition and fair competition for everybody, and the removal of the payments tie and removal of the anticompetitive measures, which obviously leads to far better deals for consumers and developers.\nWhat we don\u2019t want is a special deal just for ourselves, and Google\u2019s strategy so far as you\u2019ve seen from all these deals has been to basically take out all their potential competitors one at a time while they\u2019re still weak and small, before they build up or unite into a formidable force. Epic\u2019s not going to go along with something like that and do a special deal just for ourselves.\nYou\u2019ve said that a couple times, but the email that you accused Google of leaking suggested that Epic was interested in a special deal of some sort at that time. I don\u2019t know if that was on behalf of you and fellow developers. Can you tell us what that email was actually about?\nGoogle didn\u2019t leak the email; they leaked their ridiculously biased summary of it to Abner Li at 9to5Google. Don Harrison testified at trial that he didn\u2019t think Google leaked to the press. And then he was presented with a document including Google\u2019s press team and Sameer Samat, head of all Android, basically summarizing the articles that appeared as a result of Google\u2019s leaking of our plans to the press.\nSo I was wondering if you could tell me what the email actually said.\nOh, it\u2019s in evidence! This was the one I mentioned! Right before Christmas-ish 2019, we were planning to launch the new Marvel season with a bunch of Star Wars content and its awesome lineup. I asked Google\u2019s executives to let Fortnite come to the Google Play Store using our own payment method and to open up, you know, using their own payment methods to all developers, not just Epic. That was our proposal.\nOh, I think I read that one in court. I didn\u2019t realize that was the same thing. It\u2019s so far off from what I heard [about a \u201cspecial billing exception\u201d] that I didn\u2019t recognize it being that. Does winning the verdict in this Google case help your appeal with the Apple case in any way?\nThere\u2019s no linkage between the cases and law, so it would just come down to whether the court is in any way following current events on this topic. But there\u2019s no legal connection between the two. It really comes down to the decisions of the humans involved: the justices and the support teams involved when considering the appeal.\nGoogle will appeal this; they\u2019ve told us they\u2019re going to challenge the verdict. Will Epic rely on this ruling in the meantime?\nWe\u2019re not going to wait. We\u2019re going to do absolutely everything we can as quickly as we can to start changing the world. We not only have this verdict here in the United States, it is a worldwide verdict, right? We established a market worldwide, excluding China. So any remedies, we would presume, would be worldwide. We also have the European DMA; we have Epic v. Apple and Epic v. Google cases coming up in Australia, and another one in the UK.\nIt\u2019s not just Epic anymore, there\u2019s a lot of legislators, there\u2019s a lot of regulators, and there\u2019s other litigation all pushing in the direction of openness. And we\u2019re going to do absolutely everything we can.\nDo you have anything to say to your former partners in litigation, Match Group, that abandoned you at the last minute and may now be regretting it?\nOh, yeah, no. Match has been an awesome partner and a fellow member of the Coalition for App Fairness. I really hope that they got out of their settlement what they needed to get for their business. Very few companies have the resources that Epic has to fight multinational litigation against the world\u2019s two most powerful companies. So there are absolutely no hard feelings, and we\u2019re grateful that they joined the case because they did help in critical ways. Epic will continue to fight for all developers, seeking remedies, and... I don\u2019t know if Sundar is going to be calling me, but if he does, all of our discussions will be directed toward solving the problem for everyone.\nA lot has changed since you filed the original lawsuit over three years ago. For a bit there, it seemed like Epic had an interest in expanding outside of games with acquisitions like Houseparty and Bandcamp. What changed? And did app store restrictions play into that at all?\nLet\u2019s see. No... well, not directly, anyway. We have a really broad strategy of building games and technology. We\u2019ve had huge success in recent years with the Unreal Engine gaining adoption among all kinds of industries even beyond games. We\u2019ve also run into our own financial limitations. You know, we expanded the company to nine times the size we were before Fortnite took off. And so we\u2019re just trying to forge the strategy where we\u2019re living within our means and doing everything we absolutely can.\nBut we\u2019ve gotten so much traction with Fortnite in so many different ways, and with the Epic Games Store, right, we\u2019re going to continue investing heavily here. The Epic Games Store is the untold success story in the background. Since it launched in 2018, we now have 80 million monthly active users. Steam has 120 million, so we\u2019re catching them fast! Fortnite has more concurrent users right now than all Steam games combined. You should really expect dramatic changes that benefit all developers over the next few years.\n[Editor\u2019s note: Sweeney isn\u2019t right about Fortnite having more concurrent users than Steam. Epic spokesperson Natalie Mu\u00f1oz confirmed Sweeney misinterpreted a Polygon story about how Fortnite hit 7.6 million players at a time when the entirety of Steam had 10.1 million. These days, Steam generally peaks at over 30 million, with valleys of 20 million. Fortnite\u2019s valleys are closer to 3.8 million.]\nTim Sweeney says he plays Jellie in Fortnite. Image: Epic Games\nOkay, let\u2019s do a lightning round. What\u2019s your favorite Fortnite skin?\nI play as Jellie! Jellyfish. You know, the big tentacles? It\u2019s just so cool!\nWill Epic ever announce Unreal Tournament 3 X?\nForever in motion, the future is.\nWhy is Fortnite still not playable on Steam Deck?\nIf we only had a few more programmers. It\u2019s the Linux problem. I love the Steam Deck hardware. Valve has done an amazing job there; I wish they would get to tens of millions of users, at which point it would actually make sense to support it.\nIn October 2019, Epic internally said it might pursue an aggressive pursuit model with the Epic Games Store, where it would aggressively pay more for exclusive games and really pull in more and more users. Are you in the aggressive pursuit model?\nNo, we\u2019re in a different model, which is called the \u201cRidiculously aggressive pursuit model.\u201d If it\u2019s a 10-slide deck, that\u2019s on slide 11.\nDid you get a bingo on your Verge bingo card?\nYeah, I think it was almost a complete shutout. I think there was only one cell in the entire board that was missing. I was really impressed \u2014 the thing for that bingo card that really impressed me was \u201click the cookie.\u201d Do you remember? You may not even be old enough, but \u201click the cookie\u201d was in the 1999 US v. Microsoft antitrust trial.\n\nThis article, authored by Sean Hollister, was published by The Verge on 2023-12-12 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":170}

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Tyler Mitchell was just 23 when he became the first black photographer to shoot the cover of American Vogue. His subject was Beyonc\u00e9, and his dreamy, delicately hued portraits spoke of a precocious visual talent. In the five years since, he has exhibited around the world, become an Instagram darling, with more than 500,00 followers, and shot what would become the most controversial vice-presidential portrait in living memory. When Mitchell\u2019s portrait of Kamala Harris dressed in sneakers and casual clothing was chosen for the cover of Vogue for February 2021, the social media backlash was swift. Critics questioned why his alternative image \u2013 in which Harris looked more, well, vice-presidential \u2013 hadn\u2019t been used instead. Bowing to the outrage over the perceived lack of respect shown to the first woman to reach such high office, the magazine later issued a limited edition using the more formal shot. The controversy did little to dent the New York-based photographer\u2019s reputation as a rising star of the medium and this month, three of his works can be seen in the NGV\u2019s Triennial exhibition. The first, Picnic, depicts a family gathering: young men throw a football, and a child is lifted on shoulders. There are wicker baskets and a thermos, and in the background, a darkened wood that perhaps hints at the fragility of a moment so peaceful and pure. Tyler Mitchell, Picnic. 2021 (detail). Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York In the other works, his figures are arranged across a sandy expanse in idealised depictions of black American leisure. In Albany, Georgia, a football flies through the air, a father in dress shirt and tails twirls a child, and a young boy rides a toy truck. Vastness focuses on a teenage boy who stands patiently as his younger siblings stretch his wildly elongated sleeves out beside him; nearby, a dog sits listening to a violinist. These carefully staged set-ups are evidence of Mitchell\u2019s desire to establish a new visual narrative for black Americans.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think that I am part of a longer lineage of black artists who have considered how they respond to the Western historical art canon, but also it\u2019s 2023, and it\u2019s a new day and I think beyond just responding to that canon, we\u2019re trying to use the limited language of pictures to try and imagine what personal and unencumbered freedom looks like for young black men and women today,\u201d he tells me when we chat in New York in the lead-up to the Triennial. Loading In one of his favourite works, A Glint of Possibility, a teenage boy hangs over a river suspended on a tyre swing, studying his own reflection. The moment is pensive and peaceful at once, and relatable to anyone who\u2019s ever been a child on a tyre swing on a hot summer day. Something about it speaks to the turmoil and tension inherent in the experience of black American teenage boys, about the ways their lives can be complicated by the world we all inhabit. How even when doing unremarkable things \u2013 walking home, playing in the park, talking to their crush \u2013 their lives can be destroyed or irrevocably altered. Mitchell understands the significance of these contrasts. His work exists in the tension between what is possible and how things are. He describes it as: \u201cA consideration of joy, perseverance and self-determination against the backdrop of history.\u201d Tyler Mitchell: \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Australia so it\u2019s very exciting to sort of have a global or new conversation on a new continent with my work.\u2033\u2063 Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York The theme of the Triennial is \u201cMagic, Matter, Memory\u201d, making Mitchell\u2019s pieces a logical inclusion. \u201cA lot of my work meditates on being between a heightened reality, or potentially even a magical reality and an actual reality,\u201d he says.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m creating what I call lightly staged moments. And so that means I\u2019m setting up scenarios where these families are enjoying real moments of leisure in outdoor spaces, usually open pastures and fields, and those moments are meant to stand in for a meditation on what it means to enjoy leisurely outdoor nature as a black person.\u201d Tyler Mitchell, Vastness, 2021. Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York In the listless anxious days of the pandemic, as the Black Lives Matter movement rose in the summer of 2020, and the conversation of what black life looked like was being routinely debated in the press, black artists and activists looked to reframe that conversation, and force new perspectives of peace, luxury, and safety into the picture. Instead of seeking to record things as they are, Mitchell\u2019s work asks us to imagine new realities. He says he wants to challenge \u201cvisual regimes\u201d: assumptions about certain people or cultures that are reinforced over and over again. \u201cI think that [photojournalism] is a well from which we all culturally \u2013 consciously or unconsciously \u2013 construct ideas of how people live around the world,\u201d he says. \u201cMy work is really about responding to, and questioning, and challenging those ideas.\u201d Tyler Mitchell Albany, Georgia, 2021 (detail). Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York As a 20-year-old film student at New York University, Mitchell became enamoured with still photography after he signed up to do a documentary photography course in Havana, Cuba. Frustrated by the amount of time and money required to make films, he was drawn to the accessibility of still photography.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI was impatient when I got started and just wanted to make visual things now, and I didn\u2019t want to wait for permission, or didn\u2019t want to wait on equipment, or didn\u2019t want to lug large amounts of equipment up flights of stairs. I just wanted to make something that I felt compelled by, immediately,\u201d he says. His career has only blossomed in the years since he took that trip, and while some artists might feel trepidation at the attainment of so much success from such an early age, Mitchell is clear-eyed. \u201cThe idea of the road ahead only excites me,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea that there will be very quiet, sleepy periods, and frenetic periods, or hyperactive periods \u2026 It\u2019s always refreshing as a young person to see how the career of a much older, more senior artist has really gone. \u201cThat senior artist that we know and love today had decades where they were out of style, out of fashion, people thought their work was done, their best work was behind them, and yet, often had resurgences. Loading \u201cI think when we\u2019re thinking about crafting a career \u2026 we\u2019re really talking about allowing space for bad and good, allowing space for artists to make and work through complicated and sometimes not-so-favourable ideas. And I try to give myself that same space. It\u2019s only about giving yourself grace and space and thinking one day at a time.\u201d Asked if there\u2019s a dream project, or a dream collaborator for him, Mitchell says there are too many. But with one monograph (2020\u2019s I Can Make You Feel Good) under his belt, he\u2019s hungry to make more.\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah-Jane Collins, was published by The Age on 2023-11-27 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":171}

It likely had more to do with the lateness of the hour and financial considerations than any overwhelming faith in Arnie to run around the fortunes.\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\nBut he did just that with qualification \u2013 and an excellent run at the finals \u2013 bowing out to the eventual champions Argentina and after nearly taking them to extra time.\nHe got to answer critics like Mark Bosnich and Craig Foster as well \u2013 bluntly rejecting their negativity with the dismissive \u201cwho cares?\u201d. That would have tasted sweet.\nOn Tuesday, FA CEO James Johnson, who held firm on Arnold 20 months ago, got to congratulate the coach on his impending record-breaking match against Bangladesh as 2026 World Cup qualifying starts on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cGraham is one of the greatest contributors to the Socceroos,\u201d Johnson said in a statement.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a constant in the Australian football landscape for more than 30 years as both a player and coach, being a part of some of the Socceroos most memorable moments.\n\u201cAnyone who knows Arnie will tell you he bleeds green and gold. His love for the Socceroos and football in Australia is both infectious and inspiring. That energy and passion is a huge element to the way he\u2019s able to lead and inspire our nation\u2019s best male footballers in some of our sport\u2019s most challenging arenas.\n\u201cOn behalf of Football Australia, I\u2019d like to congratulate Arnie on everything he\u2019s achieved in reaching this milestone and we look forward to him continuing to build on what is already an exceptional legacy.\u201d\nIn a remarkable few weeks last year Arnold went from on the nose to a man revived. Since then he\u2019s been linked to club jobs in Europe but opted to stick around with the national team.\nWhile national team coaches make important calls every game, Arnold\u2019s record-breaking achievement is conceivably down to one big ballsy call in the playoff against Peru.\nWith moments left in extra time against the South Americans, Arnold dragged Mat Ryan and replaced him with Andrew Redmayne \u2013 who saved the decisive spot kick (and also threw his opponents water bottle with cheat sheet attached away from the goal).\nAdvertisement\nRyan might well have gotten the Socceroos to Qatar, but if Australia had not advanced there\u2019s little chance Arnold would still be their coach today.\nAnd there\u2019s virtually no chance he\u2019ll have to endure a similar level of stress through to the next finals \u2013 with FIFA expanding the tournament from 36 to 48 teams meaning eight direct Asian confederation qualifiers will proceed directly instead of four.\nArnold, in his second stint as national team manager, will prowl the technical area for a 59th time on Thursday, taking him clear of Frank Farina.\nArnold \u2013 who also represented the Socceroos 56 times as a player \u2013 has been involved in national team coaching ranks since 2000, first as an assistant to Farina and then Guus Hiddink, before a brief period as caretaker coach in 2006.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a proud moment and an achievement that I\u2019ll reflect on when the time is right,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cI look at some of the names on that list \u2013 Farina, Arok, Thompson, Rasic \u2013 guys I played under or assisted in the early part of my coaching career, and it gives you some perspective on what a journey it\u2019s been so far.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think back to that caretaker period and how much I learnt about coaching; it was a challenging experience and one that on reflection I probably wasn\u2019t ready for. I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity I was given and what it was able to teach me ahead of my pathway into club coaching.\n\u201cI was able to put lessons from that time into practice, develop and eventually return to the Socceroos much more prepared for the role. It\u2019s been a privilege to be part of the national team again with the benefit of that experience, and I\u2019m immensely proud of what this group has been able to achieve in the last four years.\n\u201cIn my opinion, there\u2019s no greater honour than representing your nation on the international stage. I look at the young players coming through the Socceroos system now full of pride in the work they\u2019ve put in to get where they are, and the journey that\u2019s ahead of them.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved being a part of the Socceroos culture and my desire to see Australia fulfil its footballing potential is still driving me to take this group to further success.\u201d\nAustralia starts the road to north America in Melbourne at AAMI Park on Thursday night, before travelling to the Middle East to play Palestine next Wednesday (1.00am AEDT).\nFor this stage of qualifiers there are nine groups of four teams, with Lebanon the other team in Group I.\nThe top two teams from each group will advance into three groups of six for the next stage. The top two from those games \u2013 from September 2024 to June 2025 \u2013 will directly advance to the play offs with another qualifying round to determine the seventh and eight direct qualifiers.\n\nThis article, authored by Tony Harper, was published by The Roar | Sports Writers Blog on 2023-11-13 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":172}
{"title":"Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0tops box office with $21 million debut for concert film \u2018Renaissance\u2019","context":"## Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0tops box office with $21 million debut for concert film \u2018Renaissance\u2019\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 ruled the box office this weekend.\nHer concert picture, \u201c Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d opened in first place with $21 million in North American ticket sales, according to estimates from AMC Theatres Sunday.\nThe post-Thanksgiving, early December box office is notoriously slow, but \u201cRenaissance\u201d defied the odds. Not accounting for inflation, it\u2019s the first time a film has opened over $20 million on this weekend in 20 years (since \u201cThe Last Samurai\u201d).\nBeyonc\u00e9 wrote, directed and produced \u201cRenaissance,\u201d which is focused on the tour for her Grammy-winning album. It debuted in 2,539 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, as well as 94 international territories, where it earned $6.4 million from 2,621 theaters.\n\u201cOn behalf of AMC Theatres Distribution and the entire theatrical industry, we thank Beyonc\u00e9 for bringing this incredible film directly to her fans,\u201d said Elizabeth Frank, AMC Theatres executive vice president of worldwide programming, in a statement. \u201cTo see it resonate with fans and with film critics on a weekend that many in the industry typically neglect is a testament to her immense talent, not just as a performer, but as a producer and director.\u201d\nDespite several other new releases including \u201cGodzilla Minus One,\u201d the Hindi-language \u201cAnimal,\u201d Angel Studios\u2019 sci-fi thriller \u201cThe Shift,\u201d and Lionsgate\u2019s John Woo-directed revenge pic \u201cSilent Night,\u201d it was a slow weekend overall. Films in the top 10 are expected to gross only $85 million in total.\nBut it was in this traditional \u201clull\u201d that AMC Theatres found a good opportunity for \u201cRenaissance\u201d to shine.\n\u201cThey chose a great weekend,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThere was competition but it was from very different kinds of movies.\u201d\nThough \u201cRenaissance\u201d did not come close to matching the $92.8 million debut of \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d in October, it\u2019s still a very good start for a concert film. No one expected \u201cRenaissance\u201d to match \u201cThe Eras Tour,\u201d which is wrapping up its theatrical run soon with over $250 million globally. Prior to Swift, the biggest concert film debuts (titles held by Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber for their 2008 and 2011 films) had not surpassed the unadjusted sum of $32 million.\nThe 39-city, 56-show \u201cRenaissance\u201d tour, which kicked off in Stockholm, Sweden in May and ended in Kansas City, Missouri in the fall, made over $500 million and attracted over 2.7 million concertgoers. Swift\u2019s ongoing \u201cEras Tour,\u201d with 151 dates, is expected to gross some $1.4 billion.\nBoth Beyonc\u00e9 and Swift chose to partner with AMC Theatres to distribute their films, as opposed to a traditional studio. Both superstars have been supportive of one another, making splashy appearances at the other\u2019s premieres. Both had previously released films on Netflix (\u201cMiss Americana\u201d and \u201cHomecoming\u201d). And both are reported to be receiving at least 50% of ticket sales.\nMovie tickets to the show were more expensive than average, around $23.32 versus Swift\u2019s $20.78, according to data firm EntTelligence.\nCritics and audiences gave \u201cRenaissance\u201d glowing reviews \u2013 it\u2019s sitting at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and got a coveted A+ CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences who were polled. EntTelligence also estimates that the audience, around 900,000 strong, skewed a little older than Swift\u2019s.\n\u201cTo have two concert films topping the chart in a single year is pretty unprecedented,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\nBut to compare them too closely would be a mistake.\n\u201cTaylor Swift was a total outlier and the result of a very specific set of circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cThese two films are similar in genre only. \u201c\nLionsgate\u2019s \u201c The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes \u201d fell to second place in its third weekend with an estimated $14.5 million. The prequel has now earned over $121 million domestically.\n\u201c Godzilla Minus One \u201d took third place on the North American charts with $11 million from 2,308 locations \u2014 the biggest opening for a foreign film in the U.S. this year. The well-reviewed Japanese blockbuster distributed by Toho International cost only $15 million to produce and has already earned $23 million in Japan. Toho\u2019s 33rd Godzilla film is set in the aftermath of World War II, stars Ryunosuke Kamiki and was directed by Takashi Yamazaki.\n\u201cThis year, we made a concentrated effort to answer the demand of the marketplace and make Godzilla globally accessible across many different platforms,\u201d said Koji Ueda, President of Toho Global, in a statement.\n\u201cTrolls Band Together\u201d landed in fourth place in its third weekend with $7.6 million, bringing its domestic total to $74.8 million.\nFifth place went to Disney\u2019s \u201cWish,\u201d which fell 62% from its underwhelming first weekend, with $7.4 million from 3,900 locations. Globally, it\u2019s now made $81.6 million. The studio\u2019s other major film in theaters, \u201cThe Marvels\u201d is also winding down in its fourth weekend with a disastrous global tally of $197 million against the reported $300 million it cost to make and market the superhero film.\nIn its second weekend, Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d earned an estimated $7.1 million from 3,500 locations. Produced by Apple Original Films and distributed by Sony Pictures, the film starring Joaquin Phoenix has now made $45.7 million domestically against a $200 million budget.\nThings should pick up in the final weeks of 2023, with films like \u201cWonka\u201d and \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d yet to come. The industry is looking at a $9 billion year \u2014 still trailing the $11 billion pre-pandemic norm, but a marked improvement from the last few years. And there are still many solid options for moviegoers, as the industry\u2019s awards season gets into full swing.\n\u201cWe had a slow Thanksgiving and we\u2019re having a pretty slow weekend this weekend, but it\u2019s a great weekend to be a moviegoer in terms of the breadth and depth of the movies out there,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nTravis Kelce\u2019s previous comments about having children have sparked controversy amid his ongoing romance with Taylor Swift.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs player, 34, first made the remarks about starting his own family during a February 2023 episode of his and his brother Jason Kelce\u2019s podcast, New Heights. The episode resurfaced after a source claimed to Yahoo Entertainment that Swift and Travis Kelce \u201chave talked about kids\u201d within the next year.\nIn the episode of his podcast, the Philadelphia Eagles star asked his mother, Donna, which of her two sons she was \u201crooting for,\u201d as the Eagles and Chiefs were preparing to play against each other in the Super Bowl at the time.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve said in the past to both of us that you root for me because I\u2019ve given you grandkids,\u201d Jason, who shares three children \u2013 Wyatt, four, Elliotte, two, and Bennett, seven months \u2013 with wife Kylie Kelce, said. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that you root for Travis. So who do you actually root for?\u201d\nAfter Jason asked his mother again who she was rooting for, \u201cif in a battle to the death,\u201d Donna responded by asking who he\u2019d pick to save if she and her husband, Ed Kelce, were stranded in the middle of the ocean. While Donna said she couldn\u2019t pick which of her sons to root against, Jason then joked: \u201cRemember if you choose me, Wyatt and Elliotte grow up without a father.\u201d\nTravis then chimed in to joke about wanting to start his own family. \u201cI gotta start breeding,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta start breeding, to all the breeders out there.\u201d\nJason then responded to his brother\u2019s remark with: \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d before Donna advised: \u201cWait until you find the right person. Find the right person.\u201d\nHowever, Travis still doubled down on his plan, as he quipped: \u201cI\u2019m gonna find a breeder, and I\u2019m gonna get kids so that mom can love me again.\u201d\nOn X, formerly known as Twitter, fans have called Travis out for his seemingly sexist remarks and claimed that he shouldn\u2019t have been referring to women as \u201cbreeders\u201d.\n\u201cForever grateful that Joe Alwyn kept to himself and is private,\u201d one wrote, referring to Swift\u2019s ex-boyfriend of six years.\u201cIt\u2019s what makes Travis Kelce\u2019s statements from earlier this year about \u2018finding a breeder\u2019 cringe. You are free to say what you want but are not free from the consequences of doing so. Women are not objects.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Start breeding,\u2019 oh this is just f***ing disgusting and it\u2019s setting us back so much,\u201d another added. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t baby-making machines, women are more than the man they\u2019re dating, we are more than marriage.\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t a Swiftie but don\u2019t have to be one to be weirded out about Travis Kelce calling women \u2018breeders,\u2019\u201d someone else wrote. \u201cThat ain\u2019t it dude.\u201d\nMany other people went on to criticise claims about Swift and Travis having children soon, since the singer is about to return to her Eras Tour until November 2024.\n\u201cWell I know for DAMN SURE that s*** about \u2018having kids within the next year\u2019 is NOT coming from Taylor\u2019s side,\u201d one claimed. \u201cShe\u2019s got the Eras Tour booked all through next year, and she\u2019d rather die than cancel a show. But we do know who\u2019s been public about looking for a \u2018BREEDER.\u2019\u201d\nThe comments about Travis and Swift\u2019s romance came days after they seemingly confirmed their relationship. On 22 October, Swift made her return to Arrowhead Stadium to watch as the Kansas City Chiefs won their game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The occasion marked Swift\u2019s fourth time attending one of Kelce\u2019s games, amid ongoing reports that they are dating.\nFollowing the event, Chariah Gordon, the partner of Kelce\u2019s teammate Mecole Hardman Jr, took to Instagram to share a snap of the singer and NFL player\u2019s sweet PDA moment. In the picture, Swift could be seen standing next to Kelce, reaching to kiss his cheek.\nIn addition to the kiss, the football star also had the perfect reaction to a fan calling him Swift\u2019s boyfriend. After a fan shouted: \u201cLet\u2019s go Taylor\u2019s boyfriend\u201d while Kelce was waiting for an elevator, he responded with a small smile on his face and by pumping his fist into the air.\nAside from their appearances at sports events, Swift and Kelce have also been photographed together on other occasions, including a date earlier this month in New York City after their surprise appearances on the season 49 premiere of Saturday Night Live. At the time, sources alleged to Entertainment Tonight that, during the date, Kelce got a little too close to Swift\u2019s security personnel and allegedly told her bodyguard to step aside.\nHowever, during an episode of his podcast, Kelce explained what he said to the security, and clarified that he didn\u2019t push the bodyguard. \u201cI placed my hand on the gentleman\u2019s back to let him know I was behind him. If I would have pushed him, he probably would have turned around and tased me,\u201d he said.\nThe Independent has contacted representatives for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce for contact.\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-30 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":174}
{"title":"The FTX trial is bigger than Sam Bankman-Fried","context":"## The FTX trial is bigger than Sam Bankman-Fried\n\nThe trial of Sam Bankman-Fried is likely to be more consequential than just whether the man himself is found guilty. Depending on what evidence is introduced during the trial, it could be rough for the entire crypto industry.\n\u201cHow much damage can this trial do to the already beaten-down reputation of the industry at this point?\u201d asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThis trial is going to be an excruciating moment for the industry because no one knows what kind of evidence might come out.\u201d\nBankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, is facing seven counts of criminal charges: two counts of wire fraud, and five counts of conspiracy charges. FTX was a failed cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019. According to a now-deleted profile from FTX investors Sequoia Capital, FTX was founded because of Bankman-Fried\u2019s frustration with other exchanges when he was running Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm. According to the SEC, FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d diverting customers\u2019 funds to Alameda.\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\n\u201cReally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s left of FTX is now being led by John J. Ray III \u2014 you may remember him as the guy who cleaned up Enron and who also said FTX is worse than Enron. Just before the trial began, the FTX lawyers filed suit against Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents, saying they should give back millions of dollars they got from their kid. Ray has also referred to Bankman-Fried\u2019s conduct as \u201creally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\nWe have some inkling of what the government will be arguing thanks to the filings prosecutors are making in this case. They argue that Bankman-Fried lied about consumer protection and that Bankman-Fried\u2019s statements that FTX was \u201cavoiding or managing conflicts of interest\u201d and that \u201cas a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms\u201d were lies, in a superseding indictment filed August 14th.\nThe indictment also says that there were special features in FTX\u2019s code that \u201cpermitted Alameda to spend and withdraw unlimited amounts of money from FTX,\u201d which were created at Bankman-Fried\u2019s direction. That effectively exempted Alameda from the kinds of risk management other customers faced. At the same time, the government alleges, \u201cBankman-Fried publicly and repeatedly asserted that Alameda did not have privileged access to FTX.\u201d\nBankman-Fried is accused of using \u201cbillions of dollars in misappropriated FTX customer deposits\u201d to help buy more than $200 million of real estate for himself, make billions of dollars of investments for his own interest, and repay Alameda\u2019s lenders, according to the indictment, Additionally, Bankman-Fried allegedly used more than $100 million of customer funds to make political contributions; prosecutors can show evidence of those contributions in this trial, even though they aren\u2019t part of the charges brought. A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, with additional charges.\nBefore his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto \u2014 the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry. He was also very interested in publicity, sitting for many interviews both before and after the fall of FTX. The quick rise of FTX as an industry force was at least in part due to Bankman-Fried\u2019s appetite for attention. Here are the hits:\nBankman-Fried gave interviews freely \u2014 and quickly rose to public prominence in the industry. Though FTX hadn\u2019t been in the business as long as competing exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, Bankman-Fried positioned himself as an important, boyish face for crypto. (At one point, Bankman-Fried told a colleague at FTX that \u201cI honestly think it\u2019s negative EV [this may mean \u201cexpected value,\u201d as in poker] for me to cut my hair. I think it\u2019s important for people to think I look crazy.\u201d)\nBecause he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals. Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial \u2014 the part where the government must prove intent.\nThe first part of proving the government\u2019s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place. Whatever records the Southern District of New York has for the transactions will be shown.\n\u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\nThe second part is where all the drama is likely to come, says Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner and co-chair of the cryptocurrency practice at the law firm Withers. Prosecutors have to connect those transactions to Bankman-Fried, show that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and prove that he lied about it anyway.\n\u201cWhat was he saying to his parents and his other advisors about this?\u201d LaVigne says. \u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\nTo further establish intent, the government can use Bankman-Fried\u2019s own words. The indictment calls Bankman-Fried\u2019s tweets in November 2022 \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d\n\u201cWe had him going out directly to the internet,\u201d LaVigne says. If he wrote things on Twitter or said things in interviews that weren\u2019t true, that\u2019s more fodder for the government\u2019s case. \u201cThey can point to that and say, \u2018This is what he said, this is what actually happened.\u2019\u201d\nOther evidence may include Signal messages and testimony from co-conspirators who plead guilty to their own charges. Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who was also sometimes Bankman-Fried\u2019s girlfriend, may play an important role \u2014 Bankman-Fried leaked her diaries to The New York Times and was consequently jailed for witness tampering. The government has indicated FTX co-founder Gary Wang and engineering head Nishad Singh will also be among the witnesses called to give testimony about Bankman-Fried.\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him\nThere may be testimony from lenders, venture capitalists, and customers in order to establish the basis for some charges. In the indictment, the prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried lied to FTX investors. Some of those investors may be called on to testify, which is not the kind of thing VC big shots generally enjoy \u2014 and which might create collateral damage for the industry.\nIf, for instance, Sequoia Capital did due diligence around its investment in FTX, whatever Bankman-Fried told its partners could be important. Was FTX already sending Alameda customer funds at that point? Did Bankman-Fried know about it? And did he tell VCs at the time? (If he told them it wasn\u2019t happening, that would establish intent.) Binance was also an early investor in FTX, and former executives may be called on to testify as well, says Hermine Wong, the former head of policy at Coinbase and a former SEC regulator.\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him. Defense lawyers have several simultaneous objectives. First and foremost, they\u2019re trying to prove their client is not guilty. But just in case they don\u2019t get the outcome they want, they\u2019re also laying the groundwork for appeals and sentencing arguments. Any piece of evidence they want to introduce for those two purposes has to come into play in the trial.\nAlready, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers are marking arguments that his constitutional rights are being violated by his pretrial incarceration because, among other things, his internet connection wasn\u2019t good enough for him to plan his defense, notes LaVigne. That could be grounds for an appeal.\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d\nBankman-Fried\u2019s behavior after the fall of FTX suggests he\u2019s something of a wild card. He may suggest he was acting on the advice of his lawyers. But he may also introduce other evidence that could be troublesome \u2014 implying, for instance, that he was engaged in standard industry behavior or that everything that happened was Binance\u2019s fault. That may be risky, but we already know that Bankman-Fried loves risk.\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d Wong asks. \u201cAn idea like, \u2018Everyone was doing this, it\u2019s not fair I\u2019m the only one who was charged?\u2019\u201d That may not fly in a court of law, but it could absolutely damage public perception of crypto at large.\nFor instance, just before he was arrested, Bankman-Fried brought forward messages from a crypto group chat in testimony he planned to give before Congress. In that testimony, he primarily blames Binance and his lawyers at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell.\nIt\u2019s possible other messages from group chats may be brought into evidence during the trial. That can potentially be embarrassing for the whole industry, Wong says.\n\u201cYou can imagine some of these founders, CEOs, people of that echelon talk to each other somewhat informally about what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. If it seems like his peer group supported him, or worse, fawned over him, that\u2019s a real problem for the industry\u2019s reputation.\u201d\nAfter FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried went on an extensive media tour, doing interviews with The New York Times\u2019 Andrew Ross Sorkin and Good Morning America. Even under house arrest, he did interviews, including with The New Yorker. Bankman-Fried seemed to think that if he just explained things, everyone would understand that what he did was a mistake, not a crime.\n\nThis article, authored by Elizabeth Lopatto, was published by The Verge on 2023-09-28 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":175}

You are fighting for the things that happen in South Africa.\n\u201cYou are tackling for the boy who didn\u2019t get the same opportunities that you got eventually.\u201d\nFour years later and the \u201cego\u201d Erasmus spoke about is what is driving the standards and expectations around the Springboks\u2019 bid to go back-to-back.\n\u201cWe explain to the whole squad why we are going a certain route. It is not about individual selection,\u201d Springboks coach Jacques Nienaber said shortly after announcing two changes to his starting side and five in total, after going in with a forwards-heavy 7-1 bench split.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt is for South Africa. As selectors we know there will be pressure on us if we don\u2019t deliver a result but at the back of our minds we know this selection is for South Africa.\n\u201cThe players take it like that. It is not about person or ego, not that they have egos, but you can\u2019t think of that. You have to think about South Africa and the Springboks.\u201d\nSeemingly the Springboks are playing for more than themselves. They\u2019re playing for their country.\nIt\u2019s a powerful force, one that saw them progress through the knockout stages to reach the final after consecutive one-point victories.\nPressure? The South African laughs at the notion of what pressure is compared to the inequality and challenges the Rainbow Nation continues to experience.\nAdvertisement\nThe question is: how can New Zealand\u2019s All Blacks withstand and overcome the hitherto unshakable wave of momentum and spirit the Springboks play with under Erasmus in this weekend\u2019s World Cup final?\nIt would seem that, as the Springboks play for their country, the All Blacks are playing for themselves as much as anyone \u2013 and the generation of players and leaders that will call time on their international careers at week\u2019s end.\nThe backlash and toxicity that followed their historic home series loss to Ireland was a humbling and public reminder of the expectation of being an All Black.\nIt\u2019s why Saturday\u2019s World Cup final is personal for the men wearing black.\nAll Blacks social media managers were forced to delete a thousand comments an hour following the humbling series loss in Wellington.\nThe pain of the days and weeks after that dark July, as well as the bumps and bruises along the way, including as recently as August when they suffered their biggest defeat to the Boks to lose the inaugural and prestigious Qatar Cup, still runs deep.\n\u201cIt was quite special to hear some of the things those certain players said from the heart. You know, you think you know someone but once they open up and really be vulnerable in front of a team, it was quite special to hear,\u201d back-rower Dalton Papali\u2019i said this week.\n\n\u201cIt was truly something special when you hear those boys open up. You know those leaders have been through a lot in their careers, the highs and the lows, the off-field and on-field stuff, and for them to open up, it sort of makes you feel welcomed and you want to play this game for them.\n\n\u201cThere were a few tears and I think that\u2019s awesome to see, players showing vulnerability, just opening up about how much this tour and this sort of game means.\n\n\u201cThere were some (people) saying this is probably one of the most important games of All Blacks history. (The) All Blacks went through a bit of a hard path to get here, media, friends, family even criticising us and all that, and we stuck together. We weren\u2019t even said to be in the final and now look at us, we\u2019re here.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cDifferent players take it differently and some of the older players probably were hit a little bit harder and it was good to see just a bit of emotion and the want from them. Seeing that gives all the other players an extra two, three per cent to think \u2018OK, we are going to the well and we\u2019ve got to give it our all\u2019.\u201d\nThe All Blacks will experience a changing of the guard next season.\nIndeed, the All Blacks\u2019 social media channels described the team selection for the World Cup final as the \u201cLast Dance\u201d.\n2015 World Cup winner Dane Coles will call time on his career, while his tight-five teammates Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock, who is bidding to become the first player to win the Webb Ellis Cup for a third time, will head overseas.\nFellow World Cup winners Aaron Smith and Beauden Barrett will also head to Japan.\nColes, who was labelled by Samisoni Taukei\u2019aho as a \u201cGrandad\u201d type figure in the All Blacks, has even been denied the chance of a farewell send-off after missing selection.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYeah, tough,\u201d said coach Ian Foster of the conversation with the 36-year-old around leaving him out.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to talk too much about post-game stuff, but that was a tough one, probably the toughest I have had as a coach. He took it the way I expected him to. He\u2019s a champion.\u201d\nPapali\u2019i said the All Blacks were intent on sending their leaders out on a high.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few leaders in the team, it\u2019s going to be their last game in the jersey, so it\u2019s a big game for us and even the other players that are staying, knowing that we want to send those boys out on a high,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHow much they put into the jersey. We are standing on their\u2026what\u2019s that quote? It\u2019s standing on the shoulders of giants.\u201d\nThe generational change isn\u2019t just occurring on the field but off it, too.\nAdvertisement\nFoster will depart the All Blacks set up after 12 years, the last four as head coach.\nIt\u2019s been far from smooth, having overseen their historic defeats to Argentina as well as the 2-1 series loss to Ireland on home soil.\nA famous 35-23 win over the Springboks at Ellis Park saw him save his career, with Scott Robertson being lined up on the side.\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough for New Zealand Rugby to back him before this year\u2019s Test season got underway, with Robertson announced as Foster\u2019s successor.\n\u201cAm I at peace?\u201d Foster repeated a question during his World Cup team announcement when asked about where his mental state was ahead of his last Test in charge of the All Blacks.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m reasonably peaceful. I love the word but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m peaceful right now.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve just started to get my back nice and straight from last year and now you\u2019re trying to make me hunched over again!\n\u201cIt\u2019s the life of this business, it\u2019s a tough game. It\u2019s tough when you\u2019re trying to get your performance right. It\u2019s a tough game when people around you see things differently, but we\u2019ve learned a lot about ourselves.\n\u201cWe take massive pride in the jersey and making sure we reach the levels we want to. The rest of that is probably a conversation for another day.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t altered our vision of where we want this team to be.

{"title":"Arnold Schwarzenegger, Reese Witherspoon parent with tough love: 'Learning from failure'","context":"## Arnold Schwarzenegger, Reese Witherspoon parent with tough love: 'Learning from failure'\n\nHollywood is a tough place to raise kids, prompting some celebrities to take a tough-love approach to parenting.\nStars like Arnold Schwarzenegger, who admitted to being like a \"drill instructor\" when his kids were young, and Reese Witherspoon, who recently said she wants kids to deal with failure more directly, have shared their harsher parenting styles in interviews.\nOthers, like Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, are focused on keeping their kids grateful for growing up in famous families with wealth and privilege at their fingertips.\nHere's a look at a few celebrity parents focusing on firmer parenting.\nArnold Schwarzenegger\nArnold Schwarzenegger, who shares four children with ex-wife Maria Shriver and also shares a son with Mildred Baena, the family's former housekeeper, has a disciplined approach to parenting, recently admitting he had a \"drill instructor\" approach when his kids were young.\nIn a recent interview with People while promoting his new book, he recalled a moment when his eldest daughter, Katherine, brought over her 3-year-old daughter, Lyla, and saw the lesson he passed down.\n\"Katherine comes over with Lyla, and she says, 'Lyla, I told you already not to put the shoes there. Keep your shoes on, or you put them away, but you don't leave them there by the stand in front of the fireplace because you know what Daddy did? When I left my shoes there twice? The third time, he burned them in front of me and I cried,'\" he said.\nSchwarzenegger said the story was \"absolutely\" true, and he took pride in knowing that Katherine \"uses the same methods, which she cried over, and she complained about\" with Lyla as well as her other daughter, Eloise, both of whom she shares with husband Chris Pratt.\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER PRAISES DAUGHTER KATHERINE\u2019S PARENTING, REVEALS WHY GRANDKIDS LOVE COMING TO HIS HOME\nThe 76-year-old also shared similar tough-love approaches with his eldest son, Patrick.\nSchwarzenegger said that when he was 9, he threw his mattress outside after Patrick didn\u2019t make the bed.\n\"I opened up the door to the balcony, picked up the mattress and threw it down with the bedsheets, the pillows, everything. I said, 'Don't ever make someone come in and clean your room, clean your shower or make your bed,'\" he told People. \"I said, 'Because I taught you how to make the bed.'\"\nHe also battled over shower time with Patrick, feeling he was taking too long, and came up with a plan to limit them by installing a timer, similar to ones he\u2019d used in Munich.\n\"And so when he got the shower on, and he was whistling and singing in there and thinking Daddy's not around, all the sudden the ice-cold shower came on. And all of a sudden, we heard downstairs the scream,\" Schwarzenegger said.\nThe former California governor also recently issued a warning that if young people are over-pampered, this nation may be \"creating a generation of wimps and weak people.\"\n\"You can only strengthen your character and become a really strong person inside if you have resistance, if you fail, if you get up again and if you work hard,\" Schwarzenegger said on \"The Howard Stern Show.\"\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S BODYBUILDER SON IS SPITTING IMAGE OF FAMOUS DAD\nReese Witherspoon\nReese Witherspoon is a mom of three. She shares her eldest children, Ava and Deacon, with ex-husband Ryan Phillippe, and her youngest, Tennessee, with ex-husband Jim Toth.\nIn a recent interview on the \"Good Inside with Dr. Becky\" podcast, the Oscar-winner said she wants to see kids live with failure a little more.\n\"I see this a lot with parents \u2013 I don't know when we stopped letting our kids fail. Like I learned so much from the paper I didn't turn in or the demerits I got, so I got detention. I was suspended from school,\" she recalled.\nShe added, \"And my parents didn't say, \u2018Uh, she didn't deserve that,' and take me out of school. They actually let me sit in it and feel uncomfortable. So, I think learning from failure is actually a valuable tool that you can't take away from kids, right? You rob them if you don't let them sit in the discomfort of the experience.\"\nREESE WITHERSPOON AND EX JIM TOTH SETTLE DIVORCE WITH KEY STIPULATION ABOUT RAISING THEIR SON\nThe \"Walk the Line\" star remembered comforting her daughter when she was younger after she lost a basketball game \u2013 but not shying away from the lesson.\nWitherspoon recalled saying, \"'Yeah, I know. I know that probably feels really bad,'\" but then adding, \"'You know what also? Maybe you're not good at basketball?'\"\nHer daughter was slightly upset in the moment, but Witherspoon continued, \"It's actually really important to learn what you're not good at.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nDaniel Craig\nJames Bond star Daniel Craig shares one daughter with wife Rachel Weisz and has an older daughter from his previous marriage to Fiona Loudon.

I don\u2019t want to leave great sums to the next generation.\"\nA year later in an interview with Candis magazine, he repeated the sentiment that inheritance is \"distasteful\" and pondered the overall nature of wealth.\n\"Isn't there an old adage that if you die a rich person, you've failed?

That\u2019s not that bad,\u201d they said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why parents let their children use their debit\/credit cards on games, like, make them pay themselves!\u201d\nIn a statement to The Independent, a Roblox spokesperson revealed the company is looking into Gellar\u2019s complaint. \u201cWe are looking into this case and we reached out directly to the user to help. We are committed to ensuring that our users have a positive experience on the platform,\u201d they said. \u201cIn partnership with safety groups, we\u2019ve developed tools and resources like our Parent & Caregiver Guide and other helpful resources for parents to have conversations with their kids and teens about staying safe, spending controls and protecting their account. Our support team works with parents and users directly 24\/7 and can be contacted with questions here,\u201d they added, including a link to its support page.\nThe Scooby-Doo star isn\u2019t the only celebrity to publicly call out Roblox\u2019s parental controls. In the season one premiere of The Kardashians, Hulu star Kim Kardashian went head to head with Roblox after her son Saint discovered what claimed to be unseen footage of her 2007 sex tape with her ex-boyfriend Ray J.\nSaint, eight, was playing Roblox on a family member\u2019s iPad when an icon of Kardashian\u2019s infamous crying face popped up on his screen. When he showed his mother the icon, she pulled the iPad away after reading that the Roblox minigame had been registered under the username \u201cKimsNewSexTape\u201d.\nThe billionaire business mogul later shared in the episode that she planned on \u201csuing\u201d Roblox for using her name and likeness for a game. \u201cI have all the time, all the money, and all of the resources to burn them all to the f***ing ground,\u201d Kardashian said, adding: \u201cThis is supposed to be unreleased footage from my old tape, this is the last thing I want as a mom, for my past to be brought up 20 years later.\u201d\nAccording to Polygon, the developer of the minigame was reportedly banned from the online platform when the episode aired in April 2022. In a statement to the outlet, a spokesperson from Roblox confirmed the existence of the game, but explained that the \u201creferenced video was never available on our platform\u201d.\n\u201cThe referenced video was never available on our platform - we have strict moderation and policies to protect our community, including zero tolerance for sexual content of any kind which violates our Community Rules,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe text reference to the tape that got around our filters was quickly taken down and fortunately visible only to an extremely small number of people on the platform. We also swiftly took down the associated experience and banned the community developer involved with the incident.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Meredith Clark, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-12-06 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":178}
{"title":"2024 NFL Mock Draft: Bengals' Joe Burrow gets another playmaker; four QBs go in Round 1, but Pats opt for WR","context":"## 2024 NFL Mock Draft: Bengals' Joe Burrow gets another playmaker; four QBs go in Round 1, but Pats opt for WR\n\nFrom From Carolina Panthers Round 1 - Pick 1 Caleb Williams QB USC \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" \/ 215 lbs Projected Team Chicago PROSPECT RNK 2nd POSITION RNK 1st Justin Fields is expected to return to the field this week, but is it too little, too late? Chicago will have a chance to take a quarterback No. 1 overall and it may be too much to pass up a second consecutive year.\nRound 1 - Pick 2 Drake Maye QB North Carolina \u2022 Soph \u2022 6'4\" \/ 230 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Giants PROSPECT RNK 5th POSITION RNK 2nd There was doubt about Daniel Jones' viability as a long-term starter when he signed his extension. Following his ACL injury, there is no less concern. New York will have to eat a grandiose amount of dead salary cap but it is a small price to pay if Drake Maye ends up being the quarterback many expect he could be.\nRound 1 - Pick 3 Marvin Harrison Jr. WR Ohio State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" \/ 205 lbs Projected Team New England PROSPECT RNK 1st POSITION RNK 1st Marvin Harrison Jr. is arguably the best talent available in the 2024 NFL Draft, but does that matter if he is catching passes from Mac Jones or Bailey Zappe? The Patriots have to be hopeful that they find themselves in a position to draft one of the two top quarterback prospects.\nRound 1 - Pick 4 Olumuyiwa Fashanu OT Penn State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'6\" \/ 317 lbs Projected Team Arizona PROSPECT RNK 3rd POSITION RNK 1st When a new homeowner moves in, they often have a different vision of how to decorate the space. Jonathan Gannon and Monti Ossenfort are the new homeowners and they could move on from D.J. Humphries and save money toward the salary cap while likely upgrading at the position.\nRound 1 - Pick 5 Dallas Turner EDGE Alabama \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" \/ 252 lbs Projected Team Chicago PROSPECT RNK 14th POSITION RNK 3rd Chicago traded for and signed Montez Sweat to a lucrative contract extension but Yannick Ngakoue has given them nothing. The addition of Dallas Turner allows them to have a potentially dynamic duo.\nRound 1 - Pick 6 Joe Alt OT Notre Dame \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'7\" \/ 322 lbs Projected Team Green Bay PROSPECT RNK 7th POSITION RNK 3rd The David Bakhtiari experience may be over in Green Bay but there is a tantalizing off-ramp with the addition of Joe Alt.\nRound 1 - Pick 7 JC Latham OT Alabama \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'6\" \/ 360 lbs Projected Team L.A. Rams PROSPECT RNK 6th POSITION RNK 2nd Los Angeles' offensive tackles have had two of the highest beaten rates in the NFL this season, according to TruMedia. JC Latham allows them to upgrade on one side of the line.\nRound 1 - Pick 8 Brock Bowers TE Georgia \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" \/ 240 lbs Projected Team Tennessee PROSPECT RNK 4th POSITION RNK 1st Brock Bowers is the lone remaining blue-chip talent. If Will Levis is the future then they need to surround him with the skill talent that may give him a chance to succeed.\nRound 1 - Pick 9 Jared Verse EDGE Florida State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" \/ 260 lbs Projected Team Atlanta PROSPECT RNK 12th POSITION RNK 2nd Atlanta likes heavy-handed pass rushers who can set the edge and Jared Verse falls into that category. The Falcons have added some older veterans at the position but it is not a viable long-term solution.\nRound 1 - Pick 10 Laiatu Latu EDGE UCLA \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'5\" \/ 265 lbs Projected Team Washington PROSPECT RNK 11th POSITION RNK 1st After moving on from Chase Young and Montez Sweat, Washington has a need for rushing the passer. Laiatu Latu may end up being the best out of this draft class.\nRound 1 - Pick 11 J.J. McCarthy QB Michigan \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'3\" \/ 202 lbs Projected Team Tampa Bay PROSPECT RNK 21st POSITION RNK 4th Baker Mayfield is replaced in Tampa Bay with J.J. McCarthy. It was a Michigan quarterback that led the Buccaneers to the promised land last time so perhaps lightning strikes twice.\nRound 1 - Pick 12 Amarius Mims OT Georgia \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'7\" \/ 340 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Jets PROSPECT RNK 23rd POSITION RNK 4th The top-10 selections were not kind to a New York team that desperately needs offensive tackle help. The Jets select Amarius Mims, who is young and inexperienced, to upgrade the ceiling of their protection.\nRound 1 - Pick 13 Jer'Zhan Newton DL Illinois \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'2\" \/ 295 lbs Projected Team Denver PROSPECT RNK 27th POSITION RNK 2nd Jer'Zhan Newton infuses some youth into a unit that was not long ago a strength for the Broncos. Newton is a high-motor player who will help establish the culture in Denver.\nRound 1 - Pick 14 Kool-Aid McKinstry CB Alabama \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" \/ 195 lbs Projected Team L.A. Chargers PROSPECT RNK 9th POSITION RNK 2nd J.C. Jackson never became what the Chargers had hoped when they signed him. His spot in the lineup has not been filled with a long-term candidate. Kool-Aid McKinstry is a good value midway through the first round.\nRound 1 - Pick 15 Malik Nabers WR LSU \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'0\" \/ 200 lbs Projected Team Indianapolis PROSPECT RNK 13th POSITION RNK 2nd Michael Pittman Jr. is scheduled to be a free agent at season's end. If the two parties can not come to terms, Malik Nabers is a good partner for Josh Downs.\nRound 1 - Pick 16 Nate Wiggins CB Clemson \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'2\" \/ 185 lbs Projected Team Las Vegas PROSPECT RNK 19th POSITION RNK 3rd The thought of Las Vegas taking another cornerback in the first round has to be terrifying for Raiders fans but the reality is that it remains a position of need for the AFC franchise despite adding Patriots castoff Jack Jones this week.\nRound 1 - Pick 17 Cooper DeJean CB Iowa \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" \/ 207 lbs Projected Team Buffalo PROSPECT RNK 38th POSITION RNK 7th It was learned Wednesday that Cooper DeJean's season, and potentially Iowa career, is over. Buffalo adds him in the first round to fill out its secondary.\nRound 1 - Pick 18 Keon Coleman WR Florida State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" \/ 215 lbs Projected Team Cincinnati PROSPECT RNK 16th POSITION RNK 3rd Tee Higgins and Cincinnati will likely part ways after the season, which creates a need in that offense. Keon Coleman is a big-bodied receiver who can win jump balls down the field.\nRound 1 - Pick 19 JT Tuimoloau EDGE Ohio State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" \/ 270 lbs Projected Team New Orleans PROSPECT RNK 15th POSITION RNK 4th New Orleans adds a powerful rusher to its repertoire. Cam Jordan is 34 years old and has two years remaining on his contract. The Saints have a quality rotation of rushers until JT Tuimoloau eventually takes over.\nFrom From Houston Texans Round 1 - Pick 20 Chop Robinson EDGE Penn State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'3\" \/ 254 lbs Projected Team Arizona PROSPECT RNK 29th POSITION RNK 6th Arizona adds an edge rusher with higher upside to Jonathan Gannon's defense.\nRound 1 - Pick 21 Jayden Daniels QB LSU \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'4\" \/ 210 lbs Projected Team Minnesota PROSPECT RNK 76th POSITION RNK 8th The Joshua Dobbs story has been fun but the reality is that Kirk Cousins will be a free agent after the season and the organization could opt for a change. Jayden Daniels has been one of the most productive quarterbacks in football.\nRound 1 - Pick 22 Emeka Egbuka WR Ohio State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" \/ 206 lbs Projected Team Dallas PROSPECT RNK 20th POSITION RNK 4th Dallas retools at wide receiver with CeeDee Lamb and Emeka Egbuka. The franchise has struggled to find a reliable complement to Lamb since the departure of Amari Cooper.\nRound 1 - Pick 23 Taliese Fuaga OL Oregon State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'6\" \/ 334 lbs Projected Team Pittsburgh PROSPECT RNK 17th POSITION RNK 1st Pittsburgh probably has some offensive soul-searching ahead but there is no question that the addition of more protection is a sound investment.\nFrom From Cleveland Browns Round 1 - Pick 24 Bralen Trice EDGE Washington \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" \/ 274 lbs Projected Team Houston PROSPECT RNK 26th POSITION RNK 5th DeMeco Ryans is not going to settle for one or two pass rushers. He wants an Army. Bralen Trice paired with Jonathan Greenard and Will Anderson Jr. is a solid foundation.\nRound 1 - Pick 25 Denzel Burke CB Ohio State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" \/ 190 lbs Projected Team Miami PROSPECT RNK 36th POSITION RNK 6th Injuries have plagued Miami's cornerback room. So the Dolphins add more depth in the form of Ohio State's Denzel Burke.\nRound 1 - Pick 26 Tyler Nubin S Minnesota \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'2\" \/ 210 lbs Projected Team Seattle PROSPECT RNK 44th POSITION RNK 2nd Seattle adds a ballhawk who can help capitalize on the chaos created by a surprisingly active defensive front over the past month. The Seahawks have already invested in the unit with the additions of Riq Woolen and Devon Witherspoon in back-to-back years.\nRound 1 - Pick 27 Rome Odunze WR Washington \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'3\" \/ 215 lbs Projected Team Jacksonville PROSPECT RNK 31st POSITION RNK 6th Jacksonville clears the deck and starts anew with Calvin Ridley and Rome Odunze. The Jaguars have to figure out their protection issues this offseason, though.\nRound 1 - Pick 28 Kingsley Suamataia OT BYU \u2022 Soph \u2022 6'6\" \/ 325 lbs Projected Team San Francisco PROSPECT RNK 37th POSITION RNK 7th San Francisco needs to make multiple changes to its offensive line this offseason. Replacing Colton McKivitz with Kingsley Suamataia is Stage 1 of the transformation.\nRound 1 - Pick 29 Kalen King CB Penn State \u2022 Jr \u2022 5'11\" \/ 190 lbs Projected Team Baltimore PROSPECT RNK 8th POSITION RNK 1st Marlon Humphrey and the entire Baltimore secondary has struggled to stay healthy. Kalen King adds some depth to the unit.\nRound 1 - Pick 30 Graham Barton OT Duke \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'5\" \/ 314 lbs Projected Team Detroit PROSPECT RNK 35th POSITION RNK 6th Jonah Jackson and Halapoulivaati Vaitai are slated to hit free agency. If one or both leave, then it creates a void in Detroit's offensive line. Enter Graham Barton, who has played left tackle for the Blue Devils but projects inside.\nRound 1 - Pick 31 Kris Jenkins DL Michigan \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'3\" \/ 305 lbs Projected Team Kansas City PROSPECT RNK 43rd POSITION RNK 5th Kansas City adds depth to its interior defensive line with the addition of Michigan's Kris Jenkins.\n\nThis article, authored by Josh Edwards, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-11-17 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":179}
