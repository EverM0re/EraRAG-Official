{"title":"78 Absolute Best October Prime Day Deals (2023)","context":"## 78 Absolute Best October Prime Day Deals (2023)\n\nAmazon Prime Day Part II is here, and that means a fresh batch of Prime Day deals. Technically Amazon calls this Prime Big Deal Days, but like most people, we think of it as Prime Day Deux. As usual, most of these Prime Day deals require a Prime membership, but you can snag a 30-day free trial to make the most of the event. We've been combing Amazon's website to bring you the best discounts on laptops, tablets, kitchen and home gear, headphones, and plenty more.\nWe test products year-round and handpicked these deals. Products that are sold out or no longer discounted as of publishing will be crossed out. We'll update this guide regularly throughout Prime Day by adding fresh deals and removing dead deals.\nWIRED Featured Deals\nTable of Contents\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\nBest Prime Day Amazon Device Deals\nThe discount will apply automatically during checkout once you meet the $40 order threshold on select products. Amazon-branded products range from home essentials like paper towels and batteries to snacks, office supplies, over-the-counter medicines, and more. This deal is an easy way to stock up on frequently-used items for cheap.\nGift card deals are only worthwhile if you'd be spending the money anyway. With brands like Doordash, Instacart, Fandango, and more featured in this sale, chances are you can find a worthy discount. Each card has a unique coupon code listed on the product page. Enter it during checkout to save.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nAmazon devices are almost always going on sale, but this is an especially nice deal since it comes with a free smart plug that typically sells for about $20. It isn't the same exact model, but a similar Kasa plug is the top pick in our Best Smart Plugs guide. The Echo Dot (5th Gen) is one of our favorite Alexa speakers. You can use the included smart plug to do things like ask Alexa to turn off your box fan or turn on a lamp.\nAmazon has a bunch of private-label clearance on sale for up to 55 percent off. Want D-cell batteries for $5? Here you go. How about compostable plates for $8? Giant crayons for $9? A truly hideous fanny pack for $12? The point is, there are 10 pages full of random items to choose from, and all of them are cheap. Go wild.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nOther Echo Show devices are also on sale, but the Echo Show 8 is our favorite. This product comes with a free trial of Alexa Together, an Amazon service that aims to replicate the tasks of a caregiver. It usually costs $20 per month. Set a reminder to cancel it if you aren't interested in subsequent charges.\nThe Echo Studio is the best-sounding Alexa speaker, but it's also pretty expensive. This price matches a low we've seen just once before. It has more powerful sound in general, but the changes are especially noticeable on the low end. Check out our Best Smart Speakers guide for additional details and recommendations.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nThis matches the price we saw in July for the best Kindle for kids. It's waterproof and has adjustable warm lighting for reading at night. If your kid is really into the Warrior Cats books, there is a special edition just for them for $120. The standard Kindle Kids is also on sale and it's a bit cheaper at $80 ($40 off), but it lacks the adjustable warm lighting and waterproofing. Whichever you get, Amazon throws in a protective case, a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+, and a two-year no-questions-asked replacement guarantee.\nThe other Kindles are more affordable, so there's no practical reason to spend the cash for the Oasis. But if you're like me and love physical page-turn buttons, you may want to consider this one. We think it's probably due for an update soon though.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nIf you like to take digital notes, the Kindle Scribe (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first of Amazon's e-readers that lets you write on the enormous 10.2-inch screen like a regular notebook. However, if you want to write in the margins of books, you'll have to settle for using sticky notes. That's frustrating given the point of spending this kind of money is to write on it (marking up books is better on the Kobo Elipsa).\nPhotograph: Amazon\nThe Fire Max 11 (5\/10, WIRED Review) is Amazon's biggest, nicest, and most overpriced Fire tablet. This deal makes it much more palatable. The display and new fingerprint sensor are nice, as is the ability to use the keyboard without resorting to Bluetooth, but the Fire OS operating system leaves much to be desired (like a decent app store). Still, if you're set on a Fire tablet and you want a big display, this isn't a bad deal.\nBest Prime Day Laptop and Accessory Deals\nMacBook Air Photograph: Apple\nThe 2023 MacBook Air (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite laptops this year. It has an excellent six-speaker sound system, a 1080p front-facing webcam, and a 10-core variant of the M2 processor the previous year's model came with. It's blazingly fast for most normal work and can even handle some light video editing and other heavier tasks.\nThis is last year's 13-inch MacBook Pro (7\/10, WIRED Review) with the M2 chip and Touch Bar. It has the same processor that's in the new MacBook Air (our top pick for most people) and doesn't offer any major hardware upgrades except for a fan, which allows the processor to get a little warmer and eke out more power over a longer period of time. This helps if you\u2019re working on pro-level tasks like video editing but can\u2019t spend the premium that Apple charges for its bigger Pro models.\nThe Razer Blade 14 earned an 8\/10, WIRED Recommends award in our review. It has a gorgeous 16:10 display, plenty of USB ports, a full-size HDMI output, and an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti, with the option to upgrade to the 40-series, giving it plenty of power to tear through the toughest games. It's the laptop WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft used through Starfield's launch weekend; it has proven its worth already.\nPhotograph: Das Keyboard\nYou may have to click on \u201cSee More Buying Options\u201d to see this deal. The Das Keyboard MacTigr pairs well with Apple's laptops and PCs. It has a dedicated Mac layout, Cherry MX Red switches, a two-port USB-C hub, and a high-quality, all-metal build. It rarely goes on sale.\nThis is our favorite external keyboard in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. It's a great option if you're a fan of the Magic Keyboard and are looking to fully replicate your MacBook setup. However, this version is fairly bare-bones\u2014it doesn't come with a Touch ID button or the same function row keys as the M-series MacBooks (that model isn't on sale, sadly). But it does come with the standard keys like playback controls, a Mission Control key, as well as a number pad. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this keyboard, so far.\nThe Studio Display (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) has a spacious 27-inch display that's perfect for juggling multiple apps at the same time and a 5K resolution that's stunningly sharp (there's no HDR though, so colors look slightly more contrasty and saturated compared to the neutral tones on Apple's Pro Display XDR). Although it's pricey, this is an excellent monitor for those who want a really accurate and sharp screen. Equipped with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers, it's ideal for video calls too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, yet.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nOne of our top picks from our building your own PC guide, AMD's 16-core behemoth is a killer CPU for high-end 4K or 144-Hz gaming. It has some special requirements. It gets so hot there's no way you should put it into a PC without a liquid cooler like the Asus ROG Ryujin II Liquid Cooler.\nPlugable's USB-C Triple Display Docking Station is a great choice, especially for anyone using more than one monitor. It supports up to three displays at once (either HDMI or DisplayPort for each). The dock also packs six USB 3.0 ports (two on the front, four in the back) and a gigabit Ethernet port. Whenever you come back to your workstation with your MacBook, all you have to do is plug it in and you instantly have a multi-monitor setup. With an output of up to 60 watts, you can use the dock to charge your laptop too.\nClaiming the top spot in our Best USB Flash Drives guide, the SanDisk Extreme Pro balances speed, reliability, and price. The sleek aluminum case has a loop for attaching it to a keyring and a slider to push out the USB-A plug. It is fast, performs reliably (we've been using one regularly for two years), and comes with a lifetime warranty.\nBest Prime Day Tablet Deals\nPhotograph: OnePlus\nThe OnePlus Pad (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the few Android tablets we think is a worthy iPad alternative. It offers good performance, has great battery life, and an excellent 144-Hz, 11.6-inch LCD display. We strongly recommend OnePlus\u2019 magnetic keyboard, which is also on sale for $100 ($50 off), however, if you purchase directly from the company's website, you can get the keyboard bundled for free.\nThe 9th-gen iPad (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite iPad for most people, even though it's one generation behind. Aside from costing less than the current 10th-gen model, it is still compatible with the same accessories as the first-gen Apple Pencil. It retains the physical Home button with Touch ID at the bottom of the screen.\nPixel Tablet Photograph: Google\nGoogle's Pixel Tablet (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) is part tablet, part smart display. It comes with a charging dock that doubles as a speaker, so you can pump out the tunes and get answers from Google Assistant at a moment's notice. Take it off the charger and you get a full Android tablet experience.\nBest Prime Day Watch Deals\nPhotograph: Apple\nThe 2nd-generation Apple Watch SE is our top pick for most people. It's the most affordable of what Apple touts as its first carbon-neutral products (when bought in conjunction with the new sport loop, that is). It's compatible with WatchOS 10, which is where many new health and wellness features show up.\nThe second-generation Garmin Epix Pro holds the title of Best Outdoor Watch in our Best Fitness Trackers guide and is one of our favorite sports watches (8\/10, WIRED Recommends). It has a bright AMOLED display, battery life that can last through a week of camping, and useful features like redshift mode (for training outside at night), and a flashlight. There's also an endurance feature, in addition to all the other Garmin proprietary metrics that assess what kind of shape you're in. This deal applies to the 51-mm size, but the 42-mm and 47-mm sizes are also on sale.\nWe liked (but didn't love) the Withings Move smartwatch when we tried it. One of our chief complaints was its lack of heart rate monitoring, but that's an issue the Withings Steel HR has resolved, adding this crucial feature to what was already an elegant, subtle smartwatch. It has typical analog watch hands, with a smaller monochrome display for basic data, and it won't buzz your wrist all day with every single notification.\nGot an Android phone? We really liked using the TicWatch Pro 5, mostly because its battery stands out among competitors like Google, Samsung, and Apple. We easily get three days of average use, and Mobvoi\u2019s unique dual-display technology lets you stretch the battery life even further. It\u2019s powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 chipset, which is a newer and more efficient processor. And we've barely seen any hiccups operating this Wear OS 3 watch.\nBest Prime Day Phone Deals\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Photograph: Samsung\nSamsung's new Galaxy Z Flip5 (7\/10 WIRED Recommends) delivers a larger cover screen, which means you can do more on the phone without having to open it up. If you or someone you know always complain about how big phones are these days, a folding flip phone might be the answer to those woes. If you want to try a different style of flip phone, the Motorola Razr+ is also on sale for $800 ($100 off).\nPhotograph: Samsung\nDon't want to pay much for a phone? This is one of the best you'll find for the price (8\/10, WIRED Recommends). It lacks wireless charging (see the Pixel 7A below if you really want it), but the AMOLED screen has a 120-Hz screen refresh rate, the performance is decent, and the cameras are reliable. The battery also lasts more than a day.\nGoogle Pixel 7A Photograph: Google\nThis is our favorite smartphone for most people (8\/10, WIRED Recommends), and this is an incredible price (and the lowest we have tracked). It has smooth performance, a nice bright screen, excellent cameras, and even features like wireless charging. The battery life is just OK.\nWe have a lot of other good cheap phone recommendations here, but this Motorola is fine and performs well for the money. It will only get one OS update (to Android 14), but it will get three years of security updates. It comes with an NFC sensor so you can make contactless payments, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. Read our Best Motorola Phones guide for more.\nOnePlus 11 Photograph: OnePlus\nThe OnePlus 11 (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) is fast. The performance is fast, the recharging is fast. It even looks fast. It has a bright, 120-Hz AMOLED screen, great speakers, and surprisingly good battery life for all that. Our main gripe is the IP64 water- and dust-resistance rating, which is not nearly as good as other flagship phones.\nUgreen's charger is, as the name suggests, a 145-watt charger with a 25,000-mAh battery. It's surprisingly compact for the power it provides, although at 1.1 pounds, it's definitely not ultralight. There are two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. What sets the Ugreen apart is that you can actually draw 145 watts while charging. That works out to one USB-C port at 100W and the other at 45W. Very few other batteries we've tested are capable of that feat.\nPhotograph: Anker\nThe Anker Nano is one of our favorite portable power banks, particularly for phones. It clicks right into the bottom of your device, and even comes in fun colors. This model has a 12-watt Lightning connector but there is a 22.5-watt USB-C version for the iPhone 15 or Android phones for $22 ($10 off). Both connectors fold away when you aren't using them. If you use a particularly thick case, this may not work. You'll likely be able to charge most phones fully once before needing to recharge the power bank itself via the included USB-C cable.\nWe are big fans of the Backbone One (8\/10, WIRED recommends) and it appears in our Best Mobile Game Controllers guide. It slides open to cradle your phone and is very responsive, with buttons and bumpers that feel nice and clicky. The USB-C version that is on sale will work with most Android phones and the new iPhone 15 range.\nThis 2-in-1 charger is featured in our guide to the Best MagSafe Accessories. The price matches the lowest we have tracked. It doesn't have a built-in Apple Watch charger, but it can top off your compatible wireless earbuds whilst simultaneously charging your iPhone. It charges at the maximum 15-watt rate, and you can turn your iPhone sideways for iOS 17\u2019s new StandBy mode, converting it into a bedside alarm clock.\nAnker 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Charging Dock Photograph: Anker\nAnker makes our favorite lists often, including with this super compact 3-in-1 wireless charger. A MagSafe pad charges iPhones up to 15 watts at a slanted angle, and on the side is a standard Apple Watch puck (no fast-charging support). In the space inside the triangle is where you can place your AirPods Pro (or any other wireless earbuds case) to top them up.\nThis 2.5-inch cube from Anker is a great compact charger. It comes with a MagSafe pad on top (that charges at up to 15 watts), a top section that hinges to a 60-degree angle to reveal a charging surface for your AirPods, and a shelf on the side that has a built-in Apple Watch charger (which can comfortably accommodate any Apple Watch including the Ultra). You'll also get a 5-foot cable and a 30-watt charger in the box. It supports fast charging too.\nAnker 737 Power Bank Photograph: Anker\nWe just added this power bank as our top upgrade pick in our guide to the Best Portable Chargers. It's pricey, but today's deal makes it more accessible. It charges from zero to completely full in an hour and boasts a whopping 24,000-mAh capacity. And it's powerful enough to charge laptops and tablets as well as phones and other gadgets. There's even a built-in display to monitor stats like temperature and remaining battery percentage.\nThis heavy metal brick is a good option for charging laptops and smaller gadgets. It packs 20,000 mAh and supports a wide variety of fast charging standards. There is one USB-C PD port rated at 65 watts, two USB-A QC ports at 30 watts apiece, and a micro-USB input (though you are best using the USB-C to recharge it). We haven't seen it go on sale very often.\nThis travel kit from ESR works well if you want something that can prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. It can also display your Apple Watch in Nightstand mode, so you can peek and see how long before you must get out of bed. The main body folds open with a MagSafe charging pad for your iPhone and a slot behind for your AirPods. We have seen this dip a little lower, but this is still a solid deal.\nThe unusual design of Satechi's fold-up wireless charging stand allows it to charge both phones and a wireless earbuds case (if it supports Qi wireless charging), plus a USB-C port to plug in a third device\u2014not bad for a device that fits in your bag. It has a 10,000-mAh capacity with LEDs to show how much juice is left. The downside is that it is slow, offering up to 10 watts of wireless charging power for phones (7.5 watts for iPhones), 5 watts for earbuds, and 10 watts from the USB-C port.\nBest Prime Day Headphone Deals\nPhotograph: Sony\nWhile its predecessor was one of the best pairs of wireless earbuds around, the WF-1000XM5 (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) is still no slouch. They produce balanced sound, are comfortable to wear, and have active noise cancellation. When using the ANC, they last up to eight hours on a single charge, stretching to around 12 hours without it.\nThis deal is a match of historic low pricing that we don't see come around very often. The Google Pixel Buds Pro (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) are truly excellent earbuds\u2014particularly if you have an Android phone. They're comfortable and available in a wide array of colors at this price.\nThis is an invite-only deal (read more about that below). The Jabra Elite 7 Active top the list of our favorite workout earbuds. They came out in 2021, but are still the smallest, with the teeniest case, and the most comfortable we've tried. The rubber tip kept these securely in our ears while running, even while under a beanie that was rubbing against them. You can customize the level of ambient noise you let in via the Sound+ app, and they're IP57-rated to withstand sweat. You'll get 8 hours of battery life and up to 30 hours in the case.\nPhotograph: Apple\nIf you have an iPhone, these are the best earbuds. The newer USB-C model (8\/10, WIRED Recommends), has redesigned audio infrastructure, and remains to have some of the best noise canceling and microphones we've heard on a pair of earbuds.\nAnker's Space A40 earbuds (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) are packed with features for the price, with noise canceling, wireless charging, and 10 hours of battery life. Plus, they sound good, are lightweight, and comfortable to wear, which is why our reviewers say they nearly give Apple's AirPods a run for their money. Anker's Liberty 4 NC earbuds (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) are another feature-packed pair of buds with great noise canceling, and are on sale for $80 ($20 off).\nThe Beats Studio Pro (7\/10, WIRED Review) were released just a couple of months ago. We wish the battery life was longer and that the controls and EQ options were more robust. But this price makes them more worthwhile, and they do have excellent noise canceling.\nPhotograph: Bose\nThese noise-cancelling headphones are our favorite for the office. With advanced signal processing and four microphones built in, these will limit any sound around you, making them great for focusing on work in a busy environment and for Zoom calls. These often fluctuate in price, but we think it's a great deal.\nWe like Sony's standard LinkBuds (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) for the open-ear design that allows you to hear what's going on around you. If you do a lot of city walking, or use your earbuds somewhere that it's important to be aware of your surroundings, like while feeding lions at the zoo, then these are a great option.\nThese are our favorite workout headphones for running and biking\u2014any sport where you have to be aware of traffic but still want to listen to podcasts. They also fit under a helmet and have a decent 10-hour battery life.\nBest Prime Day Kitchen Deals\nPhotograph: Vitamix\nThe Vitamix 5200 is a staple on wedding registries, but, turns out, you can just buy them too. Like WIRED contributor Joe Ray, I was never really a blender person, but the Vitamix changed that. Whether you\u2019re blending smoothies, soups, or sauces, this mixer is powerful and durable. It's not cheap (even on sale), but it's worth it.\nIf you want a Vitamix, but don't want to shell out for the 5200, the Explorian is a good, cheaper alternative. This is the brand's entry-level blender, but it still has a powerful two-horsepower engine that will reduce the toughest nuts to a creamy paste.\nThe NutriBullet Smart Touch Blender comes with a 1,500-watt motor base with a 64-ounce pitcher. It features a locking lid with a spout and includes a tamper for pushing down ingredients while you blend. There's also a good selection of presets, like a pur\u00e9e setting, one for soups, one for frozen drinks, and one for smoothies.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nIf you\u2019re looking to save on counter space, the KitchenAid Artisan Mini is better suited to smaller kitchens and households. The full-size, 5-quart version is also on sale for $380 ($60 off).\nSous vide cooking is a great way to stop overcooking your food. It's a handy addition to any kitchen, and the Nano 3.0 is one of our favorite starter precision cookers.\nThis AeroGarden goes on sale all the time, but the price is right. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe said it was super easy to use. Simply place the seed pods in their corresponding holes, keep the bottom filled up with water, and wait. Just keep in mind that the light is bright\u2014this model would not be ideal in a studio apartment. And it'll grow herbs like crazy, which is a blessing or a curse depending on how much dill you can use in a given week.\nPhotograph: Zojirushi\nZojirushi's rice cookers are a favorite at WIRED. The brand uses \u201cfuzzy logic technology\u201d with a microcomputer (hence the abbreviation \u201cmicom\u201d in the product name) to make tiny adjustments in heat placement, ensuring that your grains are perfectly done, with minimal effort and no burned or wet spots. We have seen this one dip slightly lower, but this is still a good deal.\nWe love Le Creuset's enameled cast iron dishes (the bread pan isn't on sale, but it's one of our favorites). This roasting pan is a good size for everything from chicken to a prime rib.\nPhotograph: Bee's Wrap\nPlastic wrap is annoying. Try these beeswax wraps instead. They're organic cotton and sustainably sourced beeswax (along with jojoba oil and tree resin), which makes them waterproof (just make sure to use cold water to rinse them; hot water could melt off the wax). See our Best Reuseable Products guide for more great options.\nThese are a WIRED favorite. They do everything a single-use Ziplock bag does but, of course, they don't need to be thrown out and are dishwasher-, freezer-, and microwave-safe. You can also use them to keep supplies like screws, crayons, and bobby pins organized.\nIn addition to Stasher, we also love Rezip reusable baggies. They're durable, freezer-safe, and easy to clean\u2014just stick them in the dishwasher. They're also much cheaper than Stasher if you want to dip your toes into reusables. This is the 5-piece set, but there are a bunch of other options discounted too.\nPhotograph: HydroJug\nThe HydroJug (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite water bottles. It's big and heavy, but it can be a useful tool if you're often unmotivated to fill smaller, scrawnier bottles. The sale price extends to a variety of colors.\nOn Prime Day a few years ago, I (Louryn) got a multipack of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, and I accidentally conditioned myself to crave them before bed. If you fall into the same trap, or you're a normal person and you just enjoy a spicy snack from time to time, this is a good and cheap way to restock. Use Subscribe and Save to get the lowest price (or pay the nominal difference of $2 more for a one-time shipment). You can always cancel Subscribe and Save shipments after your first order arrives.\nThis All-Clad set includes 10-inch and 12-inch frying pans, which is a nice combo for families or anyone who regularly needs larger pans. All-Clad's D3 stainless steel construction has a very even heat distribution and is pretty durable. Reviewer Scott Gilbertson has seen these warp after about 10 years, but so far it hasn't happened to his. You can find more All-Clad deals here.\nWe haven't been able to try 1Zpresso's hand grinder yet, but it gets high marks from espresso gurus around the web. It's over triple the price of our favorite hand grinder, the Hario Skerton Pro ($50), so there are certainly cheaper ways to grind, but the J-Max has always garnered high marks for its ability to deliver a very even fine grind.\nPhotograph: Ninja\nThe compact pick in our guide to the best air fryers, Ninja's Max XL is notable for its space-saving design, which leaves countertop space for other tasks such as prepping vegetables. The max crisp setting is perfect for making homemade fries with a nice amount of crunch, and you can even modify conventional oven recipes to work with the Ninja.\nThe trick-or-treaters are coming (or perhaps just the midnight munchies). In any case, Amazon has a bunch of candy on sale right now, with prices starting at $2. Who doesn't need a 24-pack of Nerd Ropes?\nThese are reviewer Louryn Strampe's favorite coffee mugs, and not just because they're a brilliant shade of pink. The cups' construction makes it appear like your drink is floating, and the 16-ounce capacity means more coffee down your gullet.\nPhotograph: Zwilling\nIf you have kids who touch everything dangerous in your kitchen, we recommend the double-walled Zwilling kettle in our Best Kettles guide. It comes with six presets, as well as a dedicated button for making baby formula.\nOnce our top pick for chef knives, the Victorinox is still a great knife. We really like the nearly nonstick finish\u2014hardly anything sticks to this blade, not even fresh cilantro. It's a great all-around kitchen knife and well worth grabbing at this price.\nBest Prime Day Coffee Deals\nBreville Barista Express Impress Espresso Machine Photograph: Breville\nWhat we love about the Breville Impress (6\/10, WIRED Review) is that beginners can make good to very good espresso right out of the box. Breville has done a nice job of automating some of the trickier elements of espresso-making. The downside is that we found a good bit of variation from shot to shot.\nThe Barista Touch is a coffee shop in a machine. You get a built-in burr grinder, a hot water spout, and a digital display to control your brews. Tap the Latte button and the Touch will crank out a latte, even foaming the milk. The results are not as good as what you can do by hand, but it's a nice option if you're feeling lazy.\nThere are dozens of these milk frothers available on Amazon, from dozens of different spammy companies all selling more or less the same device. None of them are outstanding, but I bought one a few years ago and, surprisingly, it's still going. Use it to froth milk, or for what I do: mixing up matcha tea. Will this one last you years? I honestly don't know, but at least you're only out $8 if it doesn't.\nPhotograph: Fellow\nNothing beats the speed and convenience of an electric kettle for heating up water to a precise temperature. Stovetop kettles can't compete on any criteria. Plus, if you want to get into pour-over coffee, which many WIRED staffers heartily recommend, your kettle will need a gooseneck so that your pour is precise. The nearly identical EKG+ (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) has a smooth pour and can hold its temperature for up to an hour before it auto shuts off, although the 2.5-foot cable could stand to be longer.\nWe go nuts for coffee here on WIRED's Gear Team, and the ingenious AeroPress is one of our favorite portable coffee makers. It makes a damn fine cup of brew. It also happens to be incredibly easy to use and clean up. This one will make 10 fluid ounces of coffee up to a time, which is about a diner mug's worth.\nBest Prime Day Mattress Deals\nHelix Midnight Luxe Hybrid Mattress Photograph: Helix\nEnter code DEALDAY25 at checkout to get this deal, which includes two pillows. This matches the best price we've seen our favorite mattress reach. The Midnight Luxe has six layers of foam and individually wrapped inner springs. It's medium-firm and comfortable for almost all sleeping positions. There are other firmness levels within the Luxe collection that we haven't tested yet.\nCasper's hybrid bed reaches its $1,495 price but is often $1,196 on Amazon. Still, this price is among the best deals we've tracked on a bed from the brand that put bed-in-a-box mattresses on the map. This hybrid is a great neutral option. Did you read our guide and have no idea which one to go with? Get this one. It strikes a good balance between soft and supportive, with just enough bounce.\nPhotograph: My Green Mattress\nEnter code DISCOVER at checkout to see this discount. We have seen this dip slightly lower in the past, but the base price has risen since then and this price is lower than recent sales. This is our top organic mattress pick for kids. It's made from certified organic cotton, wool, and latex.\nEnter code DISCOVER at checkout to apply this discount. If you aren't ready for a whole new mattress, spruce up your existing one with a mattress topper. This organic latex choice from My Green Mattress is our favorite firm topper\u2014it's 2 inches high, has a zipper if you need to remove the organic cotton cover from the pad, and stays in place nicely without needing any straps.\nBrooklinen Weighted Throw Blanket Photograph: Brooklinen\nThis price is for the terra-cotta color only. Brooklinen's weighted blanket is 12 pounds but feels sufficiently weighty. It's held up well through many trips in the wash and cat biscuit-making sessions. It's also prettier than some other options with one side having a nice texture pattern.\nWe like several Brooklinen sheets, and this is our favorite organic set. They're soft, but not overly silky and you shouldn't sleep too hot in them. They are made from Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified organic cotton and are Oeko-Tex certified, which means they're tested for and do not contain any known toxic chemicals.\nThis amazing and gigantic blanket will be the focus of its own story in a few weeks' time. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe loves it. True to its name, it's massive, measuring 10 feet by 10 feet, so it's really easy to share\u2014even if you're a blanket hog like she is. The price matches what we've seen during other shopping holidays.\nBest Prime Day Smart Home Deals\nPhotograph: Govee\nIn our Govee Buying Guide, we selected this as the best lamp. It has a modern design and support for Amazon Alexa as well as Google Assistant. You can select the lighting using your phone or the included remote. This price matches the lowest we have seen.\nTurn anything plugged into an outlet into a smart device with a smart plug. Our favorite mini smart plug from Kasa is on sale\u2014usually available for around $17, snagging these great plugs for $6 each is a steal. It's easy to control and create routines, and these bulbs work with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings.\nPhilips Hue White and Color Ambiance Starter Kit Photograph: Amazon\nPhilips Hue's smart bulb starter kit isn't a cheap investment, and we usually only recommend it if you're looking for an upgraded kit. But it is a little cheaper right now to get three bulbs, a smart switch, and Philips' smart home hub, which you can use with older Philips bulbs and other third-party accessories. It's the lowest deal we've seen on this kit in months.\nThe Netgear Nighthawk series of routers are well regarded and make up some of the picks in our Best Routers guide. This model isn't one of the fancy ones, but it's a solid choice. You get Wi-Fi 6 support, coverage of up to 3,500 square feet, and the USB input means you can connect a storage drive for shared disk space.\nPhotograph: Newegg\nSitting at the top of our Best Wi-Fi Routers guide, this Wi-Fi 6 router is ideal for the average home seeking more reliable Wi-Fi on a budget. It has a slick, black finish with four antennas, performs reliably, and has four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. It is frequently discounted but hasn't been this low since Amazon's last Prime Day event.\nIf you're battling Wi-Fi dead zones in your house, you may need to add a mesh router to your setup. Our upgrade pick, Eero's Pro 6E (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) makes this process as simple and hands-off as it can be, and each should one covers 2,000 square feet. The brand's subscription is pricey at $10 a month (the cheaper option was eliminated)\u2014you don't have to subscribe for it to work but there are nice features like parental controls. This older Eero router is on sale for $45 if you just need something cheap right now.\nSimpliSafe (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) makes home security easy to set up and expand on as needed with multiple motion, door, and window sensors, plus panic buttons and key fob controllers. The brand has frequent sales\u2014and you've probably heard podcast ads with discount codes\u2014but we don't typically see it reach 50 percent off. We didn't like the indoor SimpliCam, but it has since been updated and we have yet to test the new one. Several other smaller bundles are also discounted between 40 and 50 percent off with different variations of accessories.\nPhotograph: Govee\nGovee makes some of our favorite smart lighting, and this is our pick for a diffused light strip that can be installed on the wall, stairs, or anywhere else in plain view. It comes with adhesive brackets, so you can make curved shapes like clouds. It supports countless effects in the Govee app and works with voice commands from Google Assistant or Alexa. Read our Best Govee Lights guide for more.\nMonster's digital frame isn't as good as options from Aura or Nixplay, which top our guide to the best digital frames, but we like it better than most other cheap frames. The 1280p screen gets you crisp photos and you can use Google Assistant or Alexa with it too. If you just can't imagine spending $150 or so on those other frames, this one works.\nIf you can spend more than the Monster above, we do prefer our top choices, but Skylight's 15-inch frame looks nice whether you put it on a shelf or wall mount it. There's a smaller 10-inch one if you want to spend less.\nEcoFlow River 2 Pro Portable Power Station Photograph: EcoFlow\nIt's debatable whether some of the Best Portable Power Stations are truly all that portable, but this one from EcoFlow is easy to carry, with a large handle along the back. The LiFeP04 battery inside is good for 768 watt-hours and perfect for keeping your gadgets charged up on camping trips. The main downside is fan noise.\nThe smaller version of this recently earned a spot in our Best Portable Chargers guide, and the larger model is our top pick of the Best Portable Power Stations, so the 1000 Plus is definitely worth a look. It packs a 1264Wh-capacity battery, loads of ports, three AC outlets, and is rated at 2,000 watts with a 4,000-watt peak power capability, which means you can plug in electric grills and other small appliances without worrying.\nTile Sticker Two-Pack Photograph: Tile\nIf you're constantly losing remotes, Tile's Stickers can come in handy. These Bluetooth tracker stickers can be stuck onto remotes, e-readers, or anything else you want to keep track of within a 150-foot range. This is the best price we've seen since last year.\nPetcube makes some of our favorite pet cameras, and this one holds more treats (1.5 pounds) and larger pieces (up to 1 inch in diameter) than some of the others we tried. The Bites 2 looks good and has an extensive four-microphone array that sounds great both ways. The Bites 2 Lite loses the laser and is made from plastic rather than aluminum, but it's significantly cheaper, typically at about $100. Right now it's discounted to $80.\nEven with the subscription ($3 per month or $30 per year), this video doorbell is one of the cheapest options around, and it made the honorable mentions section in our Best Video Doorbells guide. Video quality is 1080p with a limited field of view, and notifications aren't the fastest, but it performs reliably. If you don't want a subscription, consider buying it bundled with Sync Module 2 ($47), which is also half-price right now.\nNiu KQi3 Pro Photograph: Niu\nThis is our favorite electric scooter for most people. It goes on sale regularly, so never pay full price for one. The KQi3 has great range, going 18 to 20 miles for most people. It maxes out at 20 miles per hour, the 9.5-inch tubeless tires offer a comfy ride, and the disc brakes reliably bring it to a quick stop.\nEven after trying the newer Withings Body Comp smart scale, the Body+ model is still in the sweet spot for us. It tracks data about your health including body fat, muscle mass, and total body water, and can display charts of your progress over time.\nThis is an upgraded model of our favorite, the Body+ mentioned above. It adds extra features to keep an eye on your heart health, like its built-in heart monitor that can analyze your cardiovascular health using vascular age data. We found this wasn't totally worth the extra price on the more expensive Withings Body Comp scale, but the Body Cardio is cheaper normally, and even better on this sale.\nWater damage is one of the most frightening and potentially expensive disasters any homeowner can face, but if you learn about a leak swiftly enough you can keep damage to a minimum. This kit comes with four sensors and a hub and uses the relatively long-range LoRa standard to alert you the minute any of the sensors detects water. It is our pick for larger properties in our Best Water Leak Detectors guide.\nPhotograph: Aqara\nThis chunky doorbell offers 1080p video and a wide 162-degree field of view to help you monitor your front porch. It takes regular AA batteries (but can also be wired) and it comes with an indoor hub that can record video locally onto a microSD card, but also doubles as a Wi-Fi repeater and a chime. It has wide smart home compatibility, and can even be used with Apple's HomeKit Secure Video, which is what earned it a place in our Best Video Doorbells guide.\nIf you want to stay powered up on your travels, you need a travel adapter, and this one from Epicka is the budget pick in our Best Travel Adapters guide. It works in more than 150 countries and has four USB-A ports on the bottom, plus a 15-watt USB-C port on the side. It has dropped this low before, but not for a while.\nGet not one, not two, but four of our favorite smart bulbs for the best price we've seen all year. These smart bulbs are easy to use, beautifully vibrant, comes with a variety of present colors, and work with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\nPhotograph: Nanoleaf\nWe love this light kit for adding fun ambient lighting to any room. Each hexagon is its own light, so you can control and customize the hexagons into just about any design of your choosing\u2014both in color schemes. and onto your wall. Just grab a level to make sure you put them on straight!\nThe Google Nest Hub Max has a nice big screen and slim, powerful speakers to match. It's our favorite smart display for a variety of reasons, from how nicely it doubles as a photo frame to how great it is as a kitchen assistant.\nBest Prime Day Home, Apparel, and Personal Care Deals\nTherabody Smart Goggles Photograph: Therabody\nTherabody's Smart Goggles (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) use heat, vibrations, and light pressure to massage your eyes and temples. The app lets you customize sessions and track your heart rate to help reduce stress and anxiety. It feels amazing, but it's very expensive\u2014all Therabody products are\u2014and I noticed a small hole in the eye pad after a while. It hasn't gotten bigger, but it's worth noting. We're testing Gravity's competing eye massager right now. It's not app-controlled, but it's much cheaper and we don't hate it so far.\nThe TheraFace Pro is a very expensive self-care tool. We liked it, finding it exfoliated away blackheads, cleared up stuffy sinuses from allergies, and even minimized fine lines. But there are also buzzwordy functions that may or may not work, like microcurrent. It hasn't gone on sale often in its yearish shelf life so if you can afford to spend this much on a skincare device, it's a good time to grab it. Unfortunately, the hot and cold heads are an additional $99.\nWillow Go Wearable Breast Pump Photograph: Willow\nOur favorite wearable breast pump is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to bring anywhere. What's not easy is the price tag you usually find on the Willow Go (8\/10, WIRED Recommends). It's priced similarly to a standard portable pump right now, though, making it much more worth the splurge.\nIf you're shopping for baby gear, a good deal goes a long way with how much stuff you need before little one arrives. While insurance covers some of the cost of pumps, it's often not all of it. Depending on the insurance you have, this current deal on the Elvie Stride (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) may get you closer to the price that your plan will cover.\nOur favorite stroller is all-around great: it comes with an adapter for infant car seats, has great suspension without being bulky, and folds down surprisingly close to flat. It's already a great deal for its regular price, and even more worth purchasing right now. We occasionally see it go a little lower than $300 on sale, but this is a great price to jump on.\nTushy Classic 3.0 Bidet Photograph: TUSHY\nA person once asked rhetorically: If you fell in the mud, would you reach for a sheet of toilet paper or a hose? They were talking about bidets, and put that way, it does seem to be a cleaner option. Certainly, it's gentler on your caboose. The Tushy is affordable and, as far as bidets go, easy to install on practically any toilet. There's no need for an electrical plug or a hot water hookup, which is why we gave it the recommendation as the best budget bidet that's non-electric.\nTrimming and edging the lines of a beard can be just as time-consuming and aggravating as edging a lawn. Most trimmers on the market make do with too many plastic guides of different lengths\u2014too many\u2014and yet not enough attachments for fine detailing. The Multigroom Series 9000 comes with an adjustable guide from 1 to 3 millimeters, plus a mini-foil shaver, narrow-width head, T-shaped head, ear\/nose attachment, and more. Its stainless steel construction is a rarity among consumer-level trimmers, too, and feels solid in the hand, as if you're a semi-professional barber working magic rather than just a guy in a bathroom mirror.\nCoway Airmega 250 Air Purifier Photograph: Amazon\nFor larger rooms, you want a larger air purifier, and we recommend the Airmega 250 as the best air purifier for living rooms. Product reviewer Matt Jancer has been using one for years to keep the air inside his New York City apartment clean and pure. Filters tend to be expensive at $60 to 80, but he's gotten nearly a year out of each filter, so the performance-per-price is worth it, in his opinion. Its automatic functioning will kick the purifier into high gear if heavy pollution is detected, but normally it runs on a whisper-quiet low setting when needed. Even sitting a few feet away, Matt doesn't notice it.\nEnter code WOOF25 at checkout to see this discount. I get compliments on this Diggs carrier every time I bring my cats to the vet. It works for cats or smaller dogs and it feels high-end in its construction, with lots of pockets for you. There are safety features like seat belt clips and a buckle strap and it's also been crash-tested and gets a five-star rating by the Center for Pet Safety. The only thing I dislike is that you can't really see through the mesh to make sure your pet is OK, but the company says this is to give nervous pets some privacy and calmness.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nA sunrise alarm wakes you up at you set time by gradually brightening and changing the color temperature, or the color spectrum, to mimic real sunlight. It's a gentler way to wake up than a blaring alarm. Like most sunrise alarms, the WiiM also has a sunset feature for winding down before bed. Of all the ones WIRED reviewer Matt Jancer tested, the WiiM was the easiest to set up and walk the user through its operation on the connected app.\nWIRED reviewer Matt Jancer has relied on the 35-pint model to keep his East Coast apartment habitable during sweltering, humid summers. You can set the desired humidity level in 5 percent increments from 35 to 85, and the automatic functioning will turn the machine on and off as needed. It's not particularly loud for a dehumidifier, and Jancer has to empty the water bin only once per day on his smaller model.\nAn electric fan is an ideal way to save a bit of money on air conditioning costs and to add a bit of pleasant white noise to boot. Unlike air conditioning, they take only a sip of electricity to run. WIRED reviewer Matt Jancer has been using the Vornado 460 for three summers and says its ability to move an impressive amount of air around a bedroom on the lowest setting belies its smallish size.\nPhotograph: Dyson\nThis has been on sale for $300 for a little while, but we still like this price. The Dyson Supersonic (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best hair dryers you can buy. It's also extremely expensive, so definitely buy it while it is on sale rather than paying full price.\nWe recommend this hair tool in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners. We have not seen it drop so low in price before. The flat iron is easy to use and comfortable to hold. We wish it had more temperature settings, but it's best for finer, wavier hair. If you want something simple that'll do the trick, and your hair isn't too textured, this is a solid option.\nThis multi-styling tool is also featured in our Best Hair Straighteners guide. It comes with round and paddle-brush attachments to get whatever look you're trying to achieve. The price is a match of the lowest we have tracked.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nWIRED readers love LifeStraw filters, and this is the lowest we tend to see them drop in price. We include this product in our guide to the Best Home Emergency Gear. It removes 99 percent of waterborne bacteria and pathogens. At this price, you could pick one up for each member of the family.\nThis is very similar to a coat we recommended in our affordable cold-weather gear guide. Orolay coats consistently go viral because they're budget-friendly and warm. While we haven't tested this exact jacket, the reviews are positive and the price is right. Other coats from the brand are also on sale.\nA full review of this bed is coming, but the tl;dr is it's super comfy with a soft, machine-washable cover and it's big enough for adults to relax in. If you stare longingly at your pet as they snooze in their tiny beds, you might want to consider investing in your own. It's expensive though, so the $100 discount is welcome.\nPhotograph: Gravity\nThe Gravity Move (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite massage guns. It's compact but works sore muscles with ease. The Move comes with four attachment heads, including a heated one that feels heavenly. We just wish the case was bigger\u2014it only fits the device and one head at a time.\nNavigating the sheer amount of printer options available is exhausting. We don't have a full printer guide just yet, but after my last one died, I bought this one on the recommendation of a fellow WIRED reviewer and have been more than happy with the results. Prints and scans are good quality. It's also wireless and you can print from your phone too.\nYou've likely seen these candles floating around your feeds and they're great buys to treat yourself or to gift others. They're 13.5 ounces, smell good, and are hand-poured in the US. Also astrology is fun, whether you're actually into it or not\u2014according to the company, I, Nena, having been born on March 28, am reclusive by nature. Accurate!\nPhotograph: Loop\nI (Adrienne) have two pairs of these ear plugs, which are the Best for Sleep in our Best Earplugs guide. They are stylish, have different-sized ear tips, and stay put much more easily than the foam ones that you buy in a giant can. I like that they're reusable!\nThis handy tool has been steadily $25 for the last few months. It isn't a huge discount, but if you have pets, you need this. Roll it across your furniture to trap all the fur in its inner compartment, then just open it up and toss that fur in the trash. It works well and you don't have to worry about refilling sticky lint rollers.\nDog owners tend to know exactly the genetic makeup of their pups. Cat owners, not so much. Basepaws gives you a chance to learn more about your feline friends. We received PDF reports 70ish pages long detailing breed percentages and it states if they're a carrier or at risk of several health issues. Any pet can get sick at any time, but it's nice to know if you're up against something that you can maybe prevent.\nI (Adrienne) am currently running in these shoes, which have a wide toe box and are designed to switch easily between running on trails and roads. They're incredibly versatile.\nLast Prime Day, we were shocked to see that Amazon even carried one of our favorite recycled clothing brands. And lo, here we are, shocked again. This is the price we saw in July for some of the best recycled workout clothes.\nBest Prime Day Vacuum Deals\nDyson V15 Detect Cordless Stick Vacuum Photograph: Dyson\nThe V15 Detect holds the top spot in our Best Dyson Vacuums guide. At 7 pounds, it's lightweight, and Dyson has made it simple to convert into a handheld model. Since it's a Detect model, it also comes with a head that projects a green laser to help you spot microscopic dust\u2014making it easy to catch particles that are invisible to the naked eye.\nLupe's cordless vacuum (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best we tried and while it's cheaper than a Dyson, it's still very expensive even on sale. The cleaner head has a standard rotating brush and a composite foam roller, and when using its highest setting, that foam creates a strong seal against the ground. Most cordless vacs are best used in between really good cleanings with a more powerful upright vacuum, but the Lupe might be all you need. Unfortunately, it sounds terrible.\nThis is the best budget-friendly Dyson, and thanks to today's deal price, the vacuum is even more accessible. It can be converted into a hand vacuum and has a runtime of about 40 minutes. The included attachments will make it easier to get into the various nooks and crannies of your home.\nIn our guide to the Best Dyson Vacuums, we say this model is worthwhile if it's priced between $300 and $400. Well, well, well, would you look at that? Looks like the price is right. This is a solid pick for pet owners. It's similar to the Animal 3, but this model has a self-adjusting cleaner head that automatically raises and lowers the base plate to seal in suction on all floor types. There's also a motorized brush for added efficiency.\nPhotograph: Shark\nThe Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite vac-mop combo in our Best Robot Vacuums guide. It vacuums well and does a thorough job of scrubbing the floors (using the included mopping bin) without getting the carpets wet. It also uses laser navigation to accurately map your home, allowing you to subdivide vacuuming and mopping zones within the easy-to-use app.\nThe Eufy X9 Pro (6\/10, WIRED Review) doesn't work well as a stand-alone robot vacuum, but it's the best mopping vacuum we've tried. On the bottom of the X9 Pro are two mops that both rotate at about 180 revolutions per minute; it's both fast and accurate. WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So says it only took 30 minutes to mop her kitchen (including a spilled half-bottle of syrup without leaving the floor sticky), laundry room, and bathroom. The docking station dries the mops for you too, so they don't get gross.\nPhotograph: Roborock\nRoborock recently launched an upgrade to this model, our favorite robot vacuum and our current top pick. WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So says that, after several years, it's still the one vacuum she hasn't unplugged and consistently calls on to clean her house after other robot vacuums have failed.\nShark's AI Ultra 2-in-1 (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) has an amazing amount of functionality for the price compared to similar robot vac-mops out there, and that's before this sweet sale price. It uses laser navigation to map your home, and you can use an app to divide it into mopping and vacuuming areas depending on your flooring. The mopping is effective without getting your floors wet, too, and you won't need replacement bin bags. The price is specifically for the black and gold colorway, but the black and silver model is also on sale (though not as much as the gold version).\nBissell Little Green Machine Carpet Cleaner Photograph: Bissell\nThis is a match of the lowest price we tend to see for this little green machine. It made our list of the Best Carpet Cleaners and the Best Viral TikTok Gadgets. It's great for cleaning furniture, stairs, and vehicles.\nThis is the version of Samsung's stick vacuum that does not purport to use AI. The good news is that you probably don't really need machine learning in a vacuum, as I noted in my review (7\/10, WIRED Review). This is a great vacuum if your midcentury modern home needs a vacuum to fit in with the stylish decor.\nRefresh your rugs with this smart carpet cleaner, which has a clever design and is fairly easy to maneuver. It is great at sucking grime out of your carpet, has a drying mode, and comes with attachments for upholstery. As the upgrade pick in our Best Carpet Cleaners guide, the relatively high price is our main criticism, so it's worth taking advantage of the discount. It does occasionally drop, but we have never seen it lower than this.\nIt can be a pain having to lug around a heavy carpet cleaner to deal with a spill or pet-related accident, so this portable, cordless cleaner from Bissell is handy. It is also mercifully easy to take apart and clean after you've dealt with the mess. It appears in our Best Carpet Cleaners guide as our favorite spot cleaner.\nBest Prime Day Lego and Other Toy Deals\nLego Marvel Hulkbuster Photograph: Amazon\nThis is not the enormous, 6,000-piece set for adults, but the version for kids. Still, commemorative theme sets tend to increase in value if you don't open them and hold them for a few years (if you can convince yourself to do that). It was $34 less when this sale first started.\nOne of the most gratifying parts of parenthood is realizing that your children are now fascinated by the same toys and characters that you loved when you were little. It never fails to blow my mind that my 6-year-old also knows who Optimus Prime is. This action figure transforms from a truck (very cool) into a robot (even cooler!) to save the Earth from the evil Decepticons. This would make a great holiday present.\nAdrienne's 6-year-old son has this playset, which they unfortunately paid full price for in a moment of weakness. It's incredibly sturdy and has lasted for several years while being stomped on and thrown into battle with other playsets. The Grimlock T-Rex motorcycle is obviously the coolest one, but siblings can share.\nYoto Player Photograph: Yoto\nKids will love this durable, portable speaker, as it can handle bedtime stories, music, and other content by slotting in cards. It also features a kid-friendly radio and a sleep mode. This appears in our Best Kids Speakers guide and is suitable for children from ages 3 to 12.\nIf you have a vase you love, but wish your flowers would last longer, LEGO has the answer for you. Build these artificial flowers that range from roses, poppies, daises and snapdragons to add to your favorite vessel.\nBehold this adorable stack of pancakes complete with a butter-and-syrup flower garnish. Have you ever seen a cuter Squishmallow? I highly doubt it. Tons of Squishmallows are on sale for Prime Day. Other options include a narwhal, hedgehog, mushroom, and possum. You can view them all here.\nMagna-Tiles are addicting for just about any kid, in the best kind of way. They're a STEM toy we're major fans of for a variety of ages. This set lets you build a road and cranes, so it's a great choice for any construction enthusiast or as an add-on to any current Magna-Tiles owners.\nFor a hazy few years, WIRED editor Adrienne So says her kids were obsessed with the Lego Ninjago series. (The show was originally commissioned as a limited run and then extended for its popularity.) This is a pretty reasonable price for a biggish 1,060-piece set that looks like a relatively simple build with a ton of minifigs.\nThis is a 4,049-piece set from the 2015 film Avengers: Age of Ultron, complete with three light-up arc reactors and compatibility with the Iron Man figure (sold separately).\nIf you're looking for a more interactive Lego set, look no further than the City Stuntz Ultimate Stunt Riders Challenge. It comes with a 360-degree loop, a ring of fire, an \u201calien tower\u201d vertical climb, a ramp, two toy motorcycles, and four Lego City minifigures. The three stunt challenges can be configured in a variety of different ways too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this Lego set, so far.\nBest Prime Day TV and Soundbar Deals\nSamsung The Frame Photograph: Walmart\nAnyone who cares about the aesthetics of their space probably doesn't want to stare at their TV screen all the time. That's where Samsung's The Frame comes in. This TV looks like a piece of art when not in use, helping it blend into the background of your well-curated space.\nThis quantum dot-enabled OLED is the brightest organic LED display that we've tested. It has shockingly bright colors to go with its great contrast. Small bezels also aid in a super immersive picture, making this one of the best TVs for brighter rooms.\nAmazon's Fire TVs are a solid and affordable way to get a quality screen for very little money. This 65-inch model has Dolby Vision support for good colors, and you can control it using your voice and Alexa.\nPhotograph: Hisense\nThe Hisense U8K is among the best-value TVs we've ever seen. It features a mini-LED display for ultra-bright colors and great contrast and is super easy to set up and use thanks to the onboard Google interface. Learn more in our full review (8\/10, WIRED Recommends).\nHisense is a purveyor of quality mid-tier TVs, and this U7 is no exception. If you're after a larger screen to enjoy sports, the 144-Hz native refresh rate makes games (both real and virtual) look smooth as silk. I also like that it supports the latest high dynamic range codecs, so you'll get the brightest, most vibrant colors possible.\nIf you need a super large screen and you don't have a ton of cash lying around, this option from TCL is solid. It has support for the latest high dynamic range codecs like Dolby Vision for great colors, and the built-in Fire TV interface features essentially any app you want. It's not the brightest or prettiest TV ever, but it is big and has bold color.\nNanoleaf's 4D Kit (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) can turn any movie or video game into a beautiful, immersive experience. The kit comes with both a trimmable light strip that fits TVs as large as 65 inches, and Nanoleaf's 4D camera that captures the TV screen's colors and projects them onto the wall behind the TV. The larger size is on sale, too, if your TV is between 65 and 85 inches.\nPhotograph: JBL\nThe JBL Bar 1300X (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with detachable wireless speakers. You can pop off the two speakers on the side of the main soundbar and place them wherever you'd like without having to worry about whether there are power outlets nearby or having to hide cables. It also has some of the best Dolby Atmos immersion we've heard from a soundbar at this price. The only downside is that, without cables, you'll have to charge the speakers between uses.\nYamaha's SR-C20A is our favorite affordable soundbar. It's affordable to tack onto even a very modest TV budget and its 100-watt forward-facing drivers can easily outperform the speakers on most TVs.\nWe're fans of nearly everything Roku offers and that includes this Streambar, which allows you to upgrade your sound and your streaming with one device. It's small enough that it's ideal for homes where space is at a premium, but still sounds good.\nPhotograph: TCL\nThis is our favorite TV to recommend for most people. The mid-tier model (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) comes equipped with quantum dot technology and support for every high dynamic range (HDR) format for stunning colors. There's a game mode too, which uses software that can upscale 1080p to 120 frames per second. It's worth noting that, unlike older models, this one comes with Google TV instead of Roku. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\nWIRED reviewer Jaina Grey has spent a few years with this very large dual-subwoofer soundbar system from Japan. The two huge subwoofers deliver earth-shattering bass, while the two side speakers and rear speakers provide more lifelike reproduction than soundbars that bounce sound off the walls for side and rear noises. It also comes with support for all major object-based surround formats (like DTS:X and Dolby Atmos). It's great for large spaces, where the extra bass response helps things feel more cinematic. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\nFor the luxury-minded, this extravagant soundbar from Sennheiser is our top pick. It has massive speakers with some of the best audio quality we've seen (or heard, I suppose) of any soundbar we've tested. It's also one of the most expensive we recommend, but its price very rarely dips this low, so if you've been waiting for the perfect sale to grab one, now's the time.\nIf you're the type to set up smart speakers and gadgets throughout your home, this soundbar from Yamaha lets you cut down on some of that work. It comes with Amazon Alexa built in, and can control a host of other smart home gadgets. We've actually seen this soundbar's price fluctuate a fair amount recently, sometimes as low as $180, but this is still nearly the cheapest we've ever seen it, so it's a good time to grab one.\nBest Prime Day Camera Deals\nGoPro Hero10 Photograph: GoPro\nGoPro recently dropped the price of the Hero10 Black (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) to $249, which makes it one of the cheapest action cameras on the market. It's two generations old, but still a very capable camera. This deal nets you an extra battery, case, small tripod, and other accessories. Check out our Best Action Cameras guide for more buying advice.\nAn upgrade over our Canon top pick in our mirrorless camera guide, the R5 features a 45-megapixel full-frame CMOS Sensor, staggeringly fast autofocus, excellent subject tracking in continuous AF mode, and dual memory card slots. It isn't cheap, but this is a pro-level beast of a camera. Note that the deal is on the body only; the lenses are sold separately.\nWe've seen this deal a couple of times in the past month, but it's still a good one. Sony's A7 III has been superseded by the A7 IV, but it's still a very nice camera. The 24.2-megapixel sensor has fantastic dynamic range and the decently fast phase-detection autofocus means you won't miss those key shots.\nPhotograph: Lexar\nI swear by these cards. I have been using them for seven years now without issue (back then they were much more expensive). They're fast enough for every camera that I've ever tested for WIRED, and I've never had any issue with them after years of life being tossed around in various camera bags.\nI remain puzzled as to why CFexpress cards are so dang expensive, but they are and if your camera uses them (and most modern, high-end video cameras do) this is about as good of a deal as we've ever seen.\nSanDisk 2-TB Extreme Portable SSD Photograph: Amazon\nOur favorite speedy portable SSD, the SanDisk is lightweight, with IP22-rated enclosures so it'll stand up to life on the go. I have been using this drive to make weekly backups for almost two years now and have had no issues. That said, our friends at Ars Technica, and other users around the web, have noted extremely high failure rates with this drive, mainly with the 2- and 4-TB versions. SanDisk has issued a firmware update, which seems to fix the problem.\nSamsung's T7 external solid-state drives are among the WIRED gear team's favorites. Lightning fast and reliable, solid-state drives take less babying than hard drives. The T7 Shield comes with a rubberized exterior to protect it from drops and impacts, and it's also IP65 water- and dust-resistant. It comes with a USB-C cable, fits in the palm of your hand, and doesn't require an external power source. Product reviewer Matt Jancer has been using several T7s and T7 Shields for three years and has never had even a hiccup. Other capacities are also on sale.\nCanon SELPHY QX10 Portable Square Photo Printer Photograph: Amazon\nSeveral WIRED staffers love this little printer that outputs perfectly-sized, small-but-not too-small, Polaroid-like images. Though technically it costs $150, this printer has been hovering at $129 lately, but $78 is still a solid deal. This price is for the black but the other colors are discounted to $99. The larger Canon SELPHY CP1500 printer we tried is also on sale for $99. That's also a solid price, but not uncommon.\nTravel and Outdoor Deals\nPhotograph: Amazon\nI (Matt Jancer) have wheeled, lifted, and slung around a lot of budget bags over dozens of trips across the globe, and the Maxlite is the one I recommend as the best budget suitcase. It's lightweight at 5.4 pounds, reasonably well made compared to the competition, and stands up to the cargo bellies of aircraft without anything more than scuff marks. For a carry-on, the two-wheel rollaboard is my preference, since it offers more interior space than a four-wheel spinner.\nHydro Flask routinely make some of our favorite insulated water bottles. Most insulated travel mugs these days can keep ice water cold and hot coffee warm. What makes Hydro Flask stand out is the durability of their powder coating. I've (Matt Jancer) knocked several around for years in gyms, at the base of rock climbing walls outdoors, and rolling around the floorboards of my old car and have never managed to scratch or dent one yet.\nThis electric bike has good looks, strong acceleration, and a better price point than the competition, especially right now with the major sale Wing is having. It's got a built-in headlight and taillight, comfortable hand grips, and a nicer seat than you'd expect. It checks a lot of boxes at its higher price point, so this is a great time to jump on this deal.\nWhen Is Amazon Prime Big Deal Days?\nAmazon's second big sale event runs from Tuesday, October 10 through Wednesday, October 11, 2023. It ends at 2:59 am ET on October 11 (11:59 pm PT).\nWill You Need a Prime Membership?\nYes, this event is for Amazon Prime members, meaning most of these Prime Day deals are for subscribers only. If you want to take the ride you need to buy the ticket. In this case, the ticket is $15 a month, and you get free two-day shipping. There are a whole bunch of other Prime Day perks you can take advantage of as well. You can also sign up for a 30-day Amazon Prime trial. Just register before the event and cancel right when the trial ends so you can take advantage of these deals. That said, there are a lot of discounted products available to folks who are not Prime subscribers. Retailers like Best Buy and Walmart are also price-matching some items or throwing their own competing sales.\nWhat Are Invite-Only Deals?\nDuring Prime Day this past summer, Amazon introduced invite-only deals\u2014a system to help make it easier for Prime members to access deals that are expected to sell out quickly\u2014and the company brought it back for Prime Big Deal Days. The feature is only available on select products but it has spread across a variety of categories and price points.\nIf a specific product is part of the Invite-Only Deals system, you'll see a \u201cRequest Invite\u201d button on the right-hand side. All you have to do is click it for a chance to buy the product at that sale price. However, it's important to note that there's no guarantee you'll receive the invite. You can learn more about the program and how it works in our story on How to Shop Like a Pro During Amazon Prime Day.\nWhen is Prime Day (Prime Big Deal Days)?\nThe second and presumably final Amazon Prime Day 2023 is happening right about.... now. Prime Day deals started flowing at 3 am EST on October 10 and will continue through October 11.\nHow to find the best Prime Big Deal Days deals?\nWIRED is the only publication posting about Amazon Prime Day. Wait, sorry, looks a handful of other sites are, too. But you should only read WIRED, because we actually vet every deal and compare it to the actual street price instead of an absurd MSRP that you will never observe in the wild. Also, we review the products we recommend and don't just send you Prime Day deals on junk that will break. It's only a deal if you need it and it's good!\nAre other retailers running sales?\nAmazon Prime Day has inspired many imitators and you'll find sales from competitors like Best Buy, Target, and the like. Some of these sales are great, and we'll flag when they are, but others are worth holding off on until Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when WIRED will again be the Internet's only website with deals posts.\nRetailer Sale Pages\n\nThis article, authored by Scott Gilbertson, was published by Wired on 2023-10-10 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":520}
{"title":"Here are the best Kindle deals right now","context":"## Here are the best Kindle deals right now\n\nWhen it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.\nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon looks to be moving beyond books and into the realm of writing \u2014 something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.\nBelow, we\u2019ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes, there isn\u2019t a deal for one or any of the products, but we\u2019ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. Keep in mind that Amazon also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.\nImage: Amazon\nThe best Kindle (2022) deals\nWhat does it mean when a Kindle is \u201cad-supported\u201d? Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.\nIn case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle last year, one that\u2019s designed to replace the 2019 model. The latest Kindle \u2014 which starts at $99.99 \u2014 puts Amazon\u2019s base e-reader more in line with the most recent Kindle Paperwhite, providing a number of quality-of-life improvements in the process. The new model features longer battery life, a 300ppi screen, and now charges via USB-C instead of Micro USB. It also touts 16GB of storage by default and comes in a new \u201cdenim\u201d color, which resembles the soft blue you might associate with jeans.\nWe recently saw Amazon\u2019s newest ad-supported Kindle drop to $79.99 ($20 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited included. Right now, though, you can only buy the Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price. However, you can pick it up on sale at Amazon with ads, a power adapter, and a fabric cover starting at $134.97 ($15 off). Regardless of whether you choose the standalone model or the bundle, the new Kindle remains a worthwhile option if you\u2019re looking to pick up an e-reader for less than the latest Paperwhite.\nThe best Kindle Kids (2022) deals\nThe new base Kindle wasn\u2019t the only e-reader Amazon introduced in 2022. The new entry-level model has arrived alongside a new Kindle Kids, which is identical to the standard model but comes with a handful of accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the new model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $119.99.\nIn terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their child access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like Percy Jackson and the entire Harry Potter series at no additional cost.\nWe recently saw the Kindle Kids drop to as low as $79.99 for Black Friday. Right now, however, there are no deals available, meaning you can only buy Amazon\u2019s latest Kindle Kids at Amazon and Best Buy for its full retail price of $119.99.\nVerge Deals on X (formerly Twitter) \/ Join nearly 51,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals Follow us!\nThe Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is identical to the standard model but features wireless charging and a sensor to automatically adjust the backlight. Photo by Chaim Gartenberg \/ The\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2021) deals\nAmazon\u2019s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its 11th-gen model, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger 6.8-inch display. The e-reader launched more than two years ago, and it often receives steep discounts at retailers like Amazon and Best Buy, particularly around Black Friday and throughout the holiday season. You can still occasionally pick up the last-gen model from 2018 at a discount.\nAmazon has also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $169.99, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.\nLastly, if you\u2019re looking for the Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition, Amazon and Best Buy are both selling the kid-friendly ebook reader for $144.99 ($25 off), which is a relatively minor discount but likely the only one we\u2019ll see before the holiday.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nThe best Kindle Oasis (2019) deals\nThe Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $249.99. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.\nThe 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof 7-inch 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.\nIn the past, we\u2019ve seen the 8GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $174.99, which remains the lowest price to date for the standalone configuration. Sadly, however, the ad-supported Oasis is only retailing at Amazon right now starting at $249.99.\nKindle Oasis Essentials Bundle (2019) $ 280 $ 310 10 % off $ 280 $ 280 $ 310 10 % off Amazon\u2019s latest Essentials Bundle packages the most recent Kindle Oasis with a power adapter and your choice of either a fabric or leather cover. $280 at Amazon (8GB)\nAs for bundles, the 8GB Kindle Oasis is currently on sale in its ad-supported configuration at Amazon with a power adapter and either a fabric cover for $279.97 ($30 off) or a leather cover for $289.97 ($30 off).\nImage: Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nThe best Kindle Scribe deals\nThe ad-free Kindle Scribe is Amazon\u2019s biggest e-reader to date \u2014 one that also represents a departure from past Kindle models. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300 dpi, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles have become known. What separates the Scribe from other models, however, is that it comes with one of two styli, which can be used to annotate books, doodle, or jot down notes. We found the e-reader\u2019s note-taking capabilities lacking in our testing, but Amazon has already started to improve the software via free OTA software updates, helping bring it up to speed with other E Ink competitors.\nAs for the model with the Premium Pen, which offers a shortcut button and a built-in eraser, it\u2019s on sale in the 16GB configuration at Amazon starting at $294.99 ($75 off). You can also pick up the 16GB model with a Premium Pen, a folio cover, and a power adapter starting at $334.97 ($115 off).\nKindle Scribe Essentials Bundle $ 310 $ 420 26 % off $ 310 $ 310 $ 420 26 % off Amazon\u2019s base Essentials Bundle comes with a 16GB Kindle Scribe, a Basic Pen stylus, a power adapter, and one of three fabric folio covers. $310 at Amazon\n\nThis article, authored by Sheena Vasani, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-16 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":521}
{"title":"Golden State's draft misses are starting to add up","context":"## Golden State's draft misses are starting to add up\n\nIn June of 2021, Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody sat on a stage on the Chase Center court, with then-GM Bob Myers to their left, as the Warriors introduced their newest first-round draft picks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI talk about the character first because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make that A-grade stick or not. It\u2019s gonna be on what they do from here on out, not what they've done so far.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that the Warriors received glowing grades from draft analysts following their selections of Kuminga, out of the G-League Ignite program, at No. 7, and Arkansas\u2019 Moody at No. 14. Unfortunately for them, that A-grade has not stuck.\nFast-forward more than two years and both players are struggling to make the sort of impact the Warriors had hoped when they flaunted their two-timeline plan. Kuminga, though he\u2019s had flashes and is only 21, is almost as raw as he was as an 18-year-old. He plays nearly 20 minutes per game for a thin Warriors team, but his shooting percentages (43.8% overall, 19.4% on 3s) have dipped to career lows. Moody has been the more stable of the two. He\u2019s a reliable catch-and-shoot threat (38.2% shooting from 3) and earnest defender but doesn\u2019t do much outside the limits of his job description.\nThe Warriors are 8-10 following Tuesday\u2019s disastrous collapse to the Kings in Sacramento. Leading by five with 58 seconds to go and a spot in the next round of the In-Season Tournament on the line, Andrew Wiggins fouled De\u2019Aaron Fox, Stephen Curry passed the ball straight to Malik Monk on his own side of the court, Draymond Green threw the ball out of bounds and Monk scored five points in the final 37 seconds to send the Warriors back to San Francisco forced to ask some tough questions.\nOn the floor for these minutes were Curry, Klay Thompson, Green, Wiggins and Kevon Looney. Four of the five were drafted by the Warriors. Steph, Klay and Draymond are the bedrock of four championship teams and perhaps the NBA\u2019s greatest dynasty this century.\nBut a franchise built through the draft has had very little success selecting players over the past decade.\nIf the Warriors seem old, it\u2019s because they are. Curry (35) can still play at an MVP level, but Green (33) and Thompson (33) are not the players they were during Golden State\u2019s run to five straight Finals.\nGreen (when he isn\u2019t suspended) can still uncork vintage defensive performances, but his offensive game has not aged well as the league trends toward more shooting. The typically affable Thompson, having suffered two major leg injuries since 2019, is bristling at questions about the starting lineup. The Warriors\u2019 starting five \u2013 a dominant unit over the last decade \u2013 is being outscored by an alarming 10.6 points every 100 possessions this season.\nThe Warriors have had a hard time reinventing themselves. The two-timeline approach was supposed to infuse the team with youth and athleticism. Instead, Kuminga and Moody can\u2019t crack the rotation some nights, and 2020\u2019s No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman now plays in Detroit.\nIf anything, the Warriors got older. Over the last nine months, they traded 24-year-old Jordan Poole to the Wizards in a deal that netted 38-year-old Chris Paul, unloaded Wiseman to bring back 30-year-old Gary Payton II and signed 29-year-old Dario Saric to help anchor the second unit. Behind the Bucks and Clippers, the Warriors are the league\u2019s third-oldest team.\nIt\u2019s easy to point to the 2020 and 2021 drafts as the problem. The Warriors \u2013 during a two-year, injury-riddled drought that separated Finals runs \u2013 in 2021 selected Kuminga one pick ahead of Franz Wagner and Moody over Alperen Sengun and Trey Murphy III. The year before, they drafted Wiseman over LaMelo Ball and Tyrese Haliburton.\n(At the risk of saying I told you so, a certain Warriors beat reporter at the time argued for the better picks here and here. There was something to be said of drafting the more NBA-ready players, even at the risk of missing out on Wiseman\u2019s and Kuminga\u2019s ceilings.)\nBut Golden State\u2019s original sins run deeper than that. Here\u2019s a look at their recent draft history.\nLooney, picked in 2015 (when \u201cUptown Funk\u201d and \u201cTrap Queen\u201d were topping music charts) is the only indisputable success. Beyond that, Poole is the only other draft pick to have signed another contract with the Warriors beyond his rookie deal.\nPoole, at 28, helped power the Warriors to the 2022 championship but was in equal amounts part of the problem the next season. (And based on his season in Washington, his 2022 playoff run is looking more and more like an outlier.)\nFour draft picks are now on other teams: Patrick Baldwin, Wiseman, Poole and Damian Jones; and four are no longer in the league: Nico Mannion, Justinian Jessup, Eric Paschall, Jacob Evans.\nJune\u2019s 19th overall pick Brandin Podziemski seems like a base hit right now, but it\u2019s been a month. Do I need to remind you of the brief flashes we saw from Paschall?\nTo be fair, it\u2019s hard to nail the draft when you\u2019re always selecting at 28 and 30. But using three lottery picks and coming away with maybe one fringe rotation player would doom any franchise that doesn\u2019t have Steph Curry.\nFor years, these picks and players have been a luxury for the Warriors, but the age problem is coming to a head. Thompson will be a free agent in seven months, Paul\u2019s contract for next season is not guaranteed and Green\u2019s new contract, though a bargain now, might not look as great when he\u2019s 37 years old.\nMaximizing what\u2019s left of Curry\u2019s championship window will prompt some tough decisions. The Warriors might have to cut bait on the two remaining lottery picks who shared a stage two years ago, Kuminga and Moody. Either one could have value as a \u201csecond draft\u201d candidate for a younger team. For instance, Kuminga\u2019s $6 million salary can be added to Payton to build $14.7 million in outgoing salary. Moody\u2019s $3.9 million is some sugar to sweeten a deal for any of Golden State\u2019s higher-priced players.\nAvailable big names like Zach LaVine might not make a ton of sense given his age and contract, but everything from All-Star acquisitions to trading for helpful role players should be on the table. If the Warriors decide to reorient the roster around Curry between now and February\u2019s trade deadline, new GM Mike Dunleavy Jr. would be tasked with rebuilding a jet mid-flight.\nWhether it\u2019s before the trade deadline or next summer, it feels like something is bound to change in Golden State. The draft picks haven\u2019t panned out and Curry\u2019s supporting cast is showing its age, but finding solutions in the middle is easier said than done.\n\nThis article, authored by Wes Goldberg, RealGM, was published by Yardbarker on 2023-11-29 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":522}

Nine years ago, Michelle Andrews and Zara McDonald were both 20 and working entry-level jobs in Melbourne at women\u2019s media company Mamamia. Covering late shifts, often on weekends, they\u2019d regularly share an Uber home. A friendship soon grew out of their shared love of pop culture. \u201cWe\u2019d be watching the same TV shows and listening to the same podcasts,\u201d says Andrews, now 29. Their back-seat chats eventually led to an idea: Shameless \u2013 \u201ca pop culture podcast for smart people who love dumb stuff\u201d. The story of how they came to leave Mamamia \u2013 after having their idea rejected at the final hour \u2013 has been told many times. But these days, it\u2019s not a moment they think of often, unless they\u2019re asked about it in an interview. \u201cIt ended up being amazing for us that they didn\u2019t want the show,\u201d says Andrews. Fast-forward to today, and the women are now well known as the \u201cShameless girls\u201d \u2013 co-founders of Shameless Media, a company built out of their passion for smart conversations about pop culture. \u201cWe feel so far removed from that time,\u201d adds McDonald, 29, reflecting on their start. Since launching Shameless Media \u2013 the home of not just Shameless but also the Everybody Has a Secret, Shameless Book Club and Love etc. podcasts \u2013 in 2019, the company has gone from strength to strength. Today, it has 1.1 million followers across social media, plus 1 million unique listeners and 2\u00bd million podcast downloads a month.

Both wear Converse shoes, $130, from Hype DC. Credit: Hugh Stewart For the first 10 months, Shameless was a weekend project, the podcast researched and recorded around the pair\u2019s other jobs. In those early days, McDonald and Andrews were self-funded, buying their own podcasting equipment and spending just $70 to print advertising flyers. Even now, McDonald and Andrews have never taken on any outside investment. Profitable from day one, Shameless Media now has 11 staff.\nAdvertisement\nOn the Sunday Life photo shoot in Sydney, the two friends\u2019 support for each other is as obvious as it is genuine. Together, they discuss outfit choices and every comment from either woman about not being able to make a particular item of clothing work is enthusiastically refuted by the other. The respect they have for each other is clear, and it\u2019s why they work so well together. Since launching Shameless, their lives have been entwined. Since meeting, they have been through break-ups, engagements and now weddings. When Andrews tied the knot with her long-term partner Mitchell Rees last December, McDonald was a bridesmaid. Now, McDonald is planning her own wedding, to partner Oliver Keogh, which will take place next year. Years ago, when discussing when, or even if, they each wanted to have kids, it was a conversation they knew they needed to have not just as friends but as business partners. \u201cHow do we do this and have a family if the whole business is relying on us showing up together at the same time?\u201d Zara McDonald \u201cI hate that we had to do this, but it was like, how do we have kids?\u201d says McDonald. \u201cHow do we do this and have a family if the whole business is relying on us showing up together at the same time?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe only way to ensure it wouldn\u2019t be an issue was to create a contingency plan. In their case, that plan involved expanding Shameless Media by growing the team and up-skilling junior employees. While neither Andrews nor McDonald sees kids in her near future, they found it reassuring to work towards a solution. Regardless of the topic of conversation, whether it be personal or work-focused, the two try to be completely honest with each other. \u201cWe realised with every honest conversation we had, our relationship was so much better \u2013 it was far more intimate,\u201d says McDonald. The relationship McDonald and Andrews have with Shameless listeners is also based on trust. Their podcast episodes are meticulously well-researched, book recommendations are solid and the advice given via their Ask Shameless newsletter aims to always hit the mark.

Credit: Hugh Stewart In many ways, the relationship between Shameless Media and its audience is much like that between the friends. It began with a shared interest in celebrity gossip and TV shows, before moving into more personal recommendations of books and podcasts, until eventually reaching the stage where life\u2019s most personal questions can be asked and answered. Ask Shameless, which lands in more than 64,000 subscriber inboxes each Friday, answers reader questions about work, dating, friendship and more. The best of these advice columns have been published in a new book, 4am: Answers to the conundrums that keep you up at night. Andrews and McDonald\u2019s second book feels markedly different to their first, The Space Between. Published in 2020, it looked to explore the complications of life in one\u2019s 20s.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe wrote it when we were so young,\u201d reflects Andrews. \u201cWe truly had internalised this belief that for our words to be worthy of attention, they had to mine the deepest, darkest events that have ever happened to us.\u201d This feeling is one Andrews has spoken about before, referring to an essay she wrote for the book which included details of her sexual assault. \u201cI wish I\u2019d just saved that for myself,\u201d she says, adding that while she wouldn\u2019t take back the essay, she would take back some of the details.

Credit: Hugh Stewart Says McDonald, \u201cIf I was to psychoanalyse us, I\u2019d say we felt guilty for having that platform that young.\u201d But that imposter syndrome is nowhere to be seen in 4am, in which Andrews and McDonald are happy to take their rightful place as agony aunts to young Australian women. In it, readers trust Andrews, McDonald and other Shameless columnists with their quandaries on everything from infidelity to sibling rivalry. The book comes at a time when many young women have trust issues. TikTok is serving eating-disorder content to those already struggling, influencers and celebrities post undisclosed advertisements, and algorithms work to push everything from egg-freezing to injectables.

{"title":"The Steam Deck OLED arrives November 16 with an improved screen and longer battery life","context":"## The Steam Deck OLED arrives November 16 with an improved screen and longer battery life\n\nSurprise! Valve has announced a new Steam Deck and \u2014 double surprise \u2014 we\u2019ve already reviewed it. It might not look like a big change from the outside, but the Steam Deck OLED is a thorough mid-cycle refresh of a machine that\u2019s not even two years old. At the same time, Valve is also adjusting the configuration of its entry-level model, making it a far more compelling option. Apologies to anyone who literally bought a Steam Deck yesterday.\nAt an event held for press prior to the device's launch, Greg Coomer, a product designer at Valve, called the new model \"the definitive version of the Steam Deck.\" He explained that the device contains many things the company wanted to include at the LCD model's launch but wasn't able to, along with some additions based on community feedback.\nAs its name suggests, the most noticeable upgrade to the Steam Deck OLED is the display. The original Steam Deck had a 7-inch 800p LCD running at 60Hz. The new model squeezes a 7.4-inch OLED screen into the same space, significantly shrinking the bezels around the display. The new panel runs at the same resolution, but with a refresh rate of up to 90Hz. It\u2019s also HDR, covering 110 percent of the P3 color space with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits \u2014 the old model maxed out at around 400 nits. Like all OLED screens, it has pure blacks and near-instantaneous response times. As before, anti-glare etched glass is available, but only on the premium model.\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a die-shrunk version of the same custom APU found in the original Steam Deck. The new APU is produced on a 6nm process, rather than the older 7nm process. Manufacturers typically use die-shrinks to either improve performance or efficiency, and Valve has chosen the latter. The max frequency of both the GPU and CPU are identical between the LCD and OLED models, so for developers tuning their games for Steam Decks, they only have a single performance target.\nIn concert with the more-efficient processor, there\u2019s also a 25 percent larger battery with a 50Whr capacity, compared to the original\u2019s 40Whr. According to Valve, these changes combined result in a 30-50 percent increase in longevity between the two generations \u2014 the official battery life claim is \"three to 12 hours.\" In our review, we measured a playtime increase of 62 percent when playing Hades on the OLED model versus our 18-month-old original. (Batteries degrade over time, which explains why our gains were more pronounced.)\nThe new internals make the Steam Deck OLED marginally lighter, and also cooler to the touch when playing games, aided by a slightly larger fan. Other improvements include support for both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, together with a new antenna array that will give a better experience when using both at the same time. There\u2019s also a reworked power supply (it has a logo now!) with a longer 2.5m cable that will charge the OLED model from 20 to 80 percent in \u201cas little as 45 minutes.\u201d The thumbsticks have also been made 1mm taller, and the touch pads' haptics are slightly sharper.\nValve\nThe Steam Deck OLED starts at $549, and will replace all but the entry-level model in the range. The immediate reality is a bit of a mess and a little complicated, but this, Valve says, will be the Steam Deck line-up moving forward:\n256GB Steam Deck LCD ($399)\n512GB Steam Deck OLED ($549)\n1TB Steam Deck OLED ($649)\nAs a result of the changes, the 64GB LCD Steam Deck (previously sold at $399) will drop to $349, and the 512GB LCD (previously $649) will drop to $499. Once Valve sells through its inventory of both, those lines will be discontinued. Valve says it will continue to support all LCD models with software updates.\nSo, the long-term lineup starts at the same $399 price, which gets you the old LCD Steam Deck, but with 256GB of storage instead of 64GB. The new step-up model costs $20 more at $549, but comes with an OLED display and the improvements outlined above, plus double the storage. The range still tops out at $649, but you\u2019re getting a lot more for your money: All of the hardware improvements, 1TB of storage instead of 512GB and an improved carry case that can pop out into a slimmer shell that\u2019s smaller and easier to fit in a bag. As mentioned, it also has the same anti-glare etched glass as the outgoing 512GB LCD model.\nFinally, there\u2019s also a Limited Edition version of the 1TB model, with a translucent shell and a customized carry case, which will be sold at $679. We imagine stocks will not last very long, as it looks pretty rad:\nValve\nWhile there are no concrete updates on future hardware developments, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais noted that, so long as interest in handheld gaming remains high, the company has \"plans for successive generations of handhelds.\" For now, Griffais explained, it's important to Valve that developers don't need to \"split their attention\" between different performance targets.\nWhen asked about the potential for future hardware \u2014 like a return of the Steam Machine or an updated Steam Controller \u2014 there were no firm updates, but there does seem to be something happening. Griffais agreed that enabling the Steam Deck to work as a hybrid living room console was a \"side goal\" of the team, and noted that everything Valve does to improve SteamOS will benefit other devices. Coomer added that Valve is still working internally on \"a bunch of controllers and prototypes.\" If SteamOS is being used on larger displays, the team would want to augment that experience with better input options. \"We don't have any announcements on that front, but it's why we're building prototypes and thinking about the future there,\" Coomer said.\nThe Steam Deck OLED will be available to order on November 16th at 1PM ET. Valve expects units to begin shipping as soon as orders start to roll in. The updated pricing on the existing LCD models is already in effect.\n\nThis article, authored by Jessica Conditt,Aaron Souppouris, was published by Engadget on 2023-11-09 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":524}
{"title":"EU says incoming rules for general purpose AIs can evolve over time","context":"## EU says incoming rules for general purpose AIs can evolve over time\n\nThe political deal clinched by European Union lawmakers late Friday over what the bloc is billing as world\u2019s first comprehensive law for regulating artificial intelligence includes powers for the Commission to adapt the pan-EU AI rulebook to keep pace with developments in the cutting edge field, it has confirmed.\nLawmakers\u2019 choice of term for regulating the most powerful models behind the current boom in generative AI tools \u2014 which the EU Act refers to as \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d AI models and systems, rather than using industry terms of choice, like \u201cfoundational\u201d or \u201cfrontier\u201d models \u2014 was also selected with an eye on futureproofing the incoming law, per the Commission, with co-legislators favoring a generic term to avoid a classification that could be chained to use of a specific technology (i.e. transformer based machine learning).\n\u201cIn the future, we may have different technical approaches. And so we were looking for a more generic term,\u201d a Commission official suggested today. \u201cFoundation models, of course, are part of the general purpose AI models. These are models that can be used for a very large variety of tasks, they can also be integrated in systems. To give you a concrete example, the general purpose AI model would be GPT-4 and the general purpose AI system would be ChatGPT \u2014 where GPT-4 is integrated in ChatGPT.\u201d\nAs we reported earlier, the deal agreed by the bloc\u2019s co-legislators includes a low risk tier and a high risk tier for regulating so-called general purpose AIs (GPAIs) \u2014 such as models behind the viral boom in generative AI tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. The trigger for high risk rules to apply on generative AI technologies is determined by an initial threshold set out in the law.\nAlso as we reported Thursday, the agreed draft of the EU AI Act references the amount of compute used to train the models, aka floating point operations (or FLOPs) \u2014 setting the bar for a GPAI to be considered to have \u201chigh impact capabilities\u201d at 10^25 FLOPs.\nBut during a technical briefing with journalists today to review the political deal the Commission confirmed this is just an \u201cinitial threshold\u201d, affirming it will have powers to update the threshold over time via implementing\/delegating acts (i.e. secondary legislation). It also said the idea is for the FLOPs threshold to be combined, over time, with \u201cother benchmarks\u201d that will be developed by a new expert oversight body to be set up within the Commission, called the AI Office.\nWhy was 25 FLOPs selected as the high risk threshold for GPAIs? The Commission suggests the figure was picked with the intention of capturing current gen frontier models. However it claimed lawmakers did not discuss nor even considered whether it would apply to any models currently in play, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 or Google\u2019s Gemini, during the marathon trilogues to agree the final shape of the rulebook.\nA Commission official added that it will, in any case, be up to makers of GPAIs to self assess whether their models meet the FLOPs threshold and, therefore, whether they fall under the rules for GPAIs \u201cwith systemic risk\u201d or not.\n\u201cThere are no official sources that will say ChatGPT or Gemini or Chinese models are at this level of FLOPs,\u201d the official said during the press briefing. \u201cOn the basis of the information we have and with this 10^25 that we have chosen we have chosen a number that could really capture, a little bit, the frontier models that we have. Whether this is capturing GPT-4 or Gemini or others we are not here now to assert \u2014 because also, in our framework, it is the companies that would have to come and self assess what the amount of FLOPs or the computing capacity they have used. But, of course, if you read the scientific literature, many will point to these numbers as being very much the most advanced models at the moment. We will see what the companies will assess because they\u2019re the best placed to make this assessment.\u201d\n\u201cThe rules have not been written keeping in mind certain companies,\u201d they added. \u201cThey\u2019ve really been written with the idea of defining the threshold \u2014 which, by the way, may change because we have the possibility to be empowered to change this threshold on the basis of technological evolution. It could go up, it could go down and we could also develop other benchmarks that in the future will be the more appropriate to benchmark the different moments.\u201d\nGPAIs that fall in the AI Act\u2019s high risk tier will face ex ante-style regulatory requirements to assess and mitigate systemic risks \u2014 meaning they must proactively test model outputs to shrink risks of actual (or \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d) negative effects on public health, safety, public security, fundamental rights, or for society as a whole.\nWhile \u201clow tier\u201d GPAIs will only face lighter transparency requirements, including obligations to apply watermarking to generative AI outputs.\nThe watermarking requirement for GPAIs falls in an article that was in the original Commission version of the risk-based framework, presented all the way back in April 2021, which focused on transparency requirements for technologies such as AI chatbots and deepfakes \u2014 but which will now also apply generally to general purpose AI systems.\n\u201cThere is an obligation to try to watermark [generative AI-produced] text on the basis of the latest state of the art technology that is available,\u201d the Commission official said, fleshing out details of the agreed watermarking obligations. \u201cAt the moment, technologies are much better at watermarking videos and audio than watermarking text. But what we ask is the fact that this watermarking takes place on the basis of state of the art technology \u2014 and then we expect, of course, that over time the technology will mature and will be as [good] as possible.\u201d\nGPAI model makers must also commit to respecting EU copyright rules, including complying with an existing machine readable opt-out from text and data mining contained in the EU Copyright Directive \u2014 and a carve-out of the Act\u2019s transparency requirements for open source GPAIs does not extend to cutting them loose from the copyright obligations, with the Commission confirming the Copyright Directive will still apply on open source GPAIs.\nAs regards the AI Office, which will play a key role in setting risk classification thresholds for GPAIs, the Commission confirmed there\u2019s no budget nor headcount defined for the expert body as yet. (Although, in the small hours of Saturday morning the bloc\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, suggested the EU is set to welcome \u201ca lot\u201d of new colleagues as it tools up this general purpose AI oversight body.)\nAsked about resourcing for the AI Office, a Commission official said it will be decided in the future by the EU\u2019s executive taking \u201can appropriate and official decision\u201d. \u201cThe idea is that we can create a dedicated budget line for the Office and that we will be able also to recruit the national experts from Member States if we wish to on top of contractual agents and on top of permanent staff. And some of these staff will also be deployed within the European Commission,\u201d they added.\nThe AI Office will work in conjunction with a new scientific advisory panel the law will also establish to aid the body to better understand the capabilities of advanced AI models for the purpose of regulating systemic risk. \u201cWe have identified an important role for a scientific panel to be set up where the scientific panel can effectively help the Artificial Intelligence Office in understanding whether there are new risks that have not been yet identified,\u201d the official noted. \u201cAnd, for example, also flag some alerts about the models that are not captured by the FLOP threshold that for certain reasons could actually give rise to important risks that governments should should look at.\u201d\nWhile the EU\u2019s executive seems keen to ensure key details of the incoming law are put out there in spite of there being no final text yet \u2014 because work to consolidate what was agreed by co-legislators during the marathon 38 hour talks that ended on Friday night is the next task facing the bloc over the coming weeks \u2014 there could still be some devils lurking in that detail. So it will be worth scrutinizing the text that emerges, likely in January or February.\nAdditionally, while the full regulation won\u2019t be up and running for a few years the EU will be pushing for GPAIs to abide by codes of practice in the meanwhile \u2014 so AI giants will be under pressure to stick as close to the hard regulations coming down the pipe as possible, via the bloc\u2019s AI Pact.\nThe EU AI Act itself likely won\u2019t be in full force until some time in 2026 \u2014 given the final text must, once compiled (and translated into Member States\u2019 languages), be affirmed by final votes in the parliament and Council, after which there\u2019s a short period before the text of the law is published in the EU\u2019s Official Journal and another before it comes into force.\nEU lawmakers have also agreed a phased approach to the Act\u2019s compliance demands, with 24 months allowed before the high risk rules will apply for GPAIs.\nThe list of strictly prohibited use-cases of AI will apply sooner, just six months after the law enters into force \u2014 which could, potentially, mean bans on certain \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d uses of AI, such as social scoring or Clearview AI-style selfie scraping for facial recognition databases, will get up and running in the second half of 2024, assuming no last minute opposition to the regulation springs up within the Council or Parliament.

{"title":"Apple 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro review: A desktop among laptops","context":"## Apple 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro review: A desktop among laptops\n\nThis thing is a beast \u2014 in pretty much every sense. It\u2019s a big, heavy, powerful system, with a bright display, massive battery life and impressive power under the hood. After opening the box, I immediately ported all the contents over from the 15-inch Air I\u2019ve been using daily for several months now, but still, the 16-inch MacBook Pro feels like a different species.\nEach has their place. I\u2019m hopping on another cross-country flight tomorrow, and I\u2019m planning to leave the 16-inch Pro at home. This is due partially to an ongoing back injury, but frankly, for as good as the Pro\u2019s battery life is (very good, for the record), the Air is a much better travel companion. It\u2019s thin, it\u2019s light, it has more than enough processing power for 95% of the things 95% of people need, and it won\u2019t wrestle you for the arm rest.\nI\u2019ve begun thinking of the 16-inch MacBook Pro as something more along the lines of a portable desktop. That is to say that the M3 Max is plenty powerful for even most professional uses. The chip also affords the laptop the ability to power up to four external displays, making it a fine workstation option for many. When it\u2019s time to take your work home (assuming you don\u2019t live in France), you can pop it in your bag and take it with you. I would recommend against taking your work (and large laptop) home with you every night, but you do you.\nhttps:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/11\/06\/apple-imac-m3-review\/\nThe new MacBook Pro, which goes on sale this week, was announced at last week\u2019s Scary Fast event, alongside a new iMac and \u2014 of course \u2014 several members of the M3 line. That latter bit marked a big departure for the company, following rumors that Apple had planned the initial M3 launch for WWDC. The supply chain ultimately thought different(ly). What announcing the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max at once affords the company, however, is options \u2014 though less so for the M3-only iMac.\nBetween the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, you\u2019ve got all three configurations covered. Presumably an M3 Ultra is also on the way in the not-too-distant future, but will almost certainly be confined to desktops like the Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, owing to the limitations of system architectures. Apple also recently shot down rumors surrounding a 27-inch iMac. The 14-inch MacBook Pro can be configured with any of the three new chips, while the 16-inch is limited to just the Pro and Max.\nApple sent us the 16-inch with the M3 Max. The company, understandably, likes to put its best foot forward with this stuff (so yes, it\u2019s also the Space Black model). The Max comes in both 14-core CPU\/30-core GPU and 16-core CPU\/40-core GPU flavors. Again, the one I am typing this on falls into the latter camp. That also means 48GB of memory and 1TB of storage by default. It\u2019s a $4,000 computer, as configured. If you want to bump the memory and storage up to 128GB and 8TB, respectively, it comes to $7,200. That\u2019s a pretty hefty increase from the base level 14- and 16-inch models, which run $1,600 and $2,500 to start.\nApple lowered the barrier of entry for the lowest end model, but \u2014 as ever \u2014 upgrades start to add up quickly. We\u2019re talking about a real investment here for you \u2014 or better yet, your company. It\u2019s certainly a system that\u2019s likely to last you a while. It\u2019s true that Apple is currently on a one-year upgrade cycle for it first-party M-series chips, but it\u2019s genuinely tough to imagine and advanced as pronounced as the one it made from Intel to in-house silicon happening any time soon. There\u2019s no such thing as a future-proofed laptop, so the best you can hope for is one that will give you good mileage. That certainly applies here.\nAlong with building new chips, Apple has spent the last few years listening to consumers in a way it hadn\u2019t for decades. That means finally updating the camera, building a better keyboard (the class action settlement probably tipped the scales as well) and ditching the well-meaning but ultimately ineffectual Touch Bar altogether. In fact, it shouldn\u2019t go unremarked upon that the arrival of the new 14-inch signaled the merciful end to that particular technology, as the last Touch Bar Mac \u2014 the 13-inch Pro \u2014 was replaced by the new 14-inch model.\nDesign\nI would say, more than anything, the thing I miss moving from the MacBook Pro to the Air is the ports. True story: At last year\u2019s CES, I had to locate an Apple Store in the Venetian because my external SD reader failed (I won\u2019t say which TechCrunch staff member laughed at me in that predicament, but they know who they are). I understand that an SD reader is kind of a niche need in these days of everyone shooting everything on their, so I can at least understand Apple\u2019s justification for keeping it to the Pro system (the new iMac doesn\u2019t have one, either).\nPorts are a different story. More ports is better. It\u2019s simple math. People can\u2019t get enough of the things. The Pro has three Thunderbolt 4\/USB-C ports to the Air\u2019s two. Also, for some reason, all of the ports (save for the headphone jack) are all on the same side with the Air. Things can get crowded fast. Both systems have the latest MagSafe connector \u2014 though I\u2019d like to point out that despite being a bespoke charger, you\u2019re able to top the laptops up faster via Thunderbolt. The other important addition on the Pro side is an HDMI port, which is key for the aforementioned external display support.\nFrom an industrial design perspective, not much has changed here from the 2021 model. Apple settled into a look it likes, balancing rounded edges with a flat, almost boxy design that isn\u2019t dissimilar from the iPhone in that respect. On top is the familiar reflective Apple logo, while \u201cMacBook Pro\u201d is etched into the bottom. Around that, you\u2019ll see a series of small screws that signal the company\u2019s newfound push into repairability spurred on by the broader call for right to repair legislation. There is also a heat vent on either side.\nThe Pros are a good bit thicker than the Air. The 14- and 16-inch are 0.61 and 0.66 inches tall, respectively, versus the 15-inch Air\u2019s 0.45 inches. This is due, in no small part to the Pros\u2019 inclusion of a fan and airflow system. You\u2019re unlikely to trigger the fan during most everyday operations, but more complex tasks like 3D rendering require a lot of compute power, so it\u2019s there when you need it. Meanwhile, the 14-inch Pro (3.4 pounds) weighs just a hair more than the 15-inch Air (3.3 pounds). At 4.7\/4.8 pounds (for the M3 Pro and Max), there\u2019s a pronounced increase with the 16-inch Pro.\nApple fans love a new color. In the case of the MacBook line, it could be attributable to the fact that there\u2019s little variation in the laptops\u2019 aluminum design. The last few generations have traded almost exclusively in space gray and silver (dark and light gray, essentially). The new Airs opened this up a bit, however, with the addition of starlight (a subtle light-gold) and midnight (a much darker gray). The space black is a nice addition. It gives off a nice glow when the light hits it. The biggest thing here, however, is the fingerprint factor. The Airs I\u2019ve tested were silver and starlight, so I can\u2019t really speak to this directly, but the midnight Air is a notorious fingerprint magnet. There are pages and pages of conversations about it on Reddit, including \u201ctips\u201d for a fingerprint-free midnight Mac. Have you tried typing in gloves? Not easy.\nApple describes the new color in the most Apple way possible, \u201cThe finish features a breakthrough chemistry that forms an anodization seal to greatly reduce fingerprints.\u201d The company hasn\u2019t perfected the wholly fingerprint-proof surface, but the new finish does an excellent job keeping things to a minimum.\nCamera\nBoth new Pro models are built around Apple\u2019s Liquid Retina XDR display. The 14-inch sports 3024 x 1964 pixels to the 16\u2019s 3456 x 2234 pixels \u2014 both come out to a pixel density of 254 ppi. The 15-inch Air, meanwhile, has a 224 ppi density. The 16-inch system\u2019s display is largely unchanged from the 2021 model. It has a 1000 nit sustained brightness and 1600 nit peak with HDR (high dynamic range) content. For SDR (standard dynamic range) content, however, brightness has been bumped up from a 500 to 600 nits max.\nBack in April 2021, the company finally started bumping its webcams from 720p to 1080p. It was a long-awaited refresh for a company that puts so much emphasis on its mobile imaging. The new hardware was coupled with improvements brought on by the M1\u2019s on-board digital signal processing. While the camera hardware has remained the same since, updates to the chips have further tweaked picture quality. As it stands now, the webcam is totally fine, and the addition of portrait and studio lighting modes further improve its. Portrait mode does still have some trouble with edges. I wear over-ear headphones while podcasting, and it hasn\u2019t quit figured out what to do with the gap between the band and my head.\nFrankly, however, Apple\u2019s biggest enemy here is itself. Continuity Camera is a game changer for many. The system lets a mounted iPhone take over webcam duties, and there\u2019s really no comparing the two. I never go on a trip without the Belkin MagSafe camera mount.\nThe on-board speaker and microphone systems, meanwhile, remain mostly unchanged from the 2021 M1 Pro. There are six speakers, with two large grilles on either side of the keyboard. The system supports both Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos. It\u2019s not an exceptional speaker system, but it gets the job done. The Pro also has a three-mic array with directional beamforming.\nM3 Max\nThe M3 line is the first of Apple\u2019s desktop chips to be created using the 3nm process, following the iPhone 15 Pro\u2019s lead. Apple has employed the 5nm process since the 2020\u2019s M1 introduction. The new process brings performance gains with less power consumption, and the Mac is the first PC line to employ the technology.\nGaming continues to be an important narrative for Apple\u2019s silicon journey, and it was very much at the heart of last week\u2019s M3 announcements. GPU updates were the centerpiece of the news for several reasons. One is a feature the company calls Dynamic Caching. Apple writes,\nWith Dynamic Caching, only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. This is an industry first, transparent to developers, and the cornerstone of the new GPU architecture. It dramatically increases the average utilization of the GPU, which significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.\nMore simply put, the idea is allocating just the right amount of local memory to a given task. It\u2019s something Apple has been working on for a while. The other two additions should be more familiar for anyone who\u2019s spent time behind a game controller. The first is ray tracing, a feature designed to bring added realism to the gaming experience, though more accurate depictions of lighting and reflections.\nThat feature is now hardware-accelerated, along with mesh shading. The triangle computer shader makes processing complex geometrical images more efficient. That, in turn, allows for higher-quality graphics and more scene detail.\nThe results are impressive. I\u2019ve been spending a bit of time with the Soulslike title, Lies of P. It\u2019s basically Pinocchio with more swords. It\u2019s of a small \u2013 but increasing \u2013 number of day-and-date releases for macOS. A couple of years ago, it would have been inconceivable for the operating system to get the game the same day as PS5, Xbox Series X\/S and Windows. That said, the macOS gaming library still has a long way to go.\nIndeed, the gameplay was smooth and detailed \u2013 something that also would have seemed impossible not all that long ago. Sony\u2019s PS5 DualShock controller connects seamlessly and makes for a fun portable gaming experience.\nOne thing I noticed during last week\u2019s presentation is that Apple is leaning less heavily on Intel comparisons. There were still a few during the event, but four-year-old non-proprietary chips are no longer the main point of comparison. Enough time and upgrades have elapsed since the M1 arrived. In fact, this Friday marks three years since it was announced. Apple again,\nRendering speeds are now up to 2.5x faster than on the M1 family of chips. The CPU performance cores and efficiency cores are 30 percent and 50 percent faster than those in M1, respectively, and the Neural Engine is 60 percent faster than the Neural Engine in the M1 family of chips.\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out here that Apple\u2019s chip numbering system isn\u2019t as straight forward as it seems at first blush. For instance, while the M3 represents an advance over the M2, you can still expect to see, say, the M2 Ultra to outperform the M3. Pros, Maxes and Ultras are progressively larger versions of their baseline chip, containing more CPU, GPU and neural engine cores. The Ultra, for example, is for all in intents and purposes, two Maxes stitched together. There are other factors at play as well, like the fact that Mac Studio and Mac Pro do a better job with heat dissipation, while the MacBook Pros are more equipped than the fan-less Airs, which throttle performance more quickly due to heat.\nThere are still a handful of ways, however, that even the baseline M3 will outperform the M2 Ultra. Two clear instances are ray tracing and mesh shading, which were previously software-accelerated.\nWith Blackmagic Disk Speed, which measures SSD performance, the 16-inch Pro scored 6367 write and 5057 read speeds, vs. the Mac Studio\u2019s 6648\/5716. Running Geekbench 6, the system scored 3149 on the single-core test and 21269 multi-core. That\u2019s a nice bump over the M3 iMac\u2019s 3024\/11810. In our Mac Studio review, the M2 Ultra got 2819 single and 21507 multi-core. Taking a step back in time to Geekbench 5 (which we\u2019ve been running on M-series systems from the outset), the M3 Max gets a single-core score of 2323 and 23190 on the multi-core. That\u2019s a big performance increase over the M3 iMac\u2019s 2191\/10619 and the M2 Max 14-inch Pro\u2018s 1952\/15249.\nThe M3 Max powering our Pro sports 16 CPU cores \u2014 that\u2019s 12 performance and 4 efficiency \u2014 while the GPU packs in a whopping 40 cores. On Cinebench 2024, it scored 142 for single-core and 1693 with the multi-core, compared to the M3 Max\u2019s 138\/617. You can see a pattern emerging. The M3 Max outperforms the M3 on everything (no surprise there) and the M2 Ultra on several single-core tests, while often coming within spitting distance with some of the multi-core tests.\nWith GeekBench 6 Metal, which tests GPU performance during complex tasks, the M3 Max scored an average of 153273. That\u2019s a nice increase over the M2 Max\u2019s 131883 average, while still getting trounced by the M2 Ultra\u2019s 208584. AMD\u2019s cards still best even the top-performing Apple chips by a good margin, with the Radeon RX 6900XT scoring 242924.\nRelative to its own family of chips, the M3 Max is doing impressive things, given that the M2 Ultra tops out at a 24-core CPU, 76-core GPU and 32-core neural engine. The Mac Studio\u2019s large body and airflow system are also much more equipped to dissipate heat, when compared to the MacBook Pro\u2019s compact profile. I will say, however, that I have so far only triggered the fan during benchmarking. The Cinebench test was run with the system in high-power mode, a setting that prioritizes performance over battery life. Low-power mode, naturally, does the inverse, while automatic (the default setting) does its best to split the difference.\nAnd Finally\nHonestly, though, the battery might be the most exceptional bit here. The first thing I did upon receiving the system (after setup and charging) was a video rundown \u2014 far and away the most lengthy part of testing. I looped a single movie (Bill & Ted Face the Music, for the record) in Apple TV, with brightness and volume at their default settings. I kicked it off at 4:45PM on Tuesday, and it ran until 7:30 the following evening. That\u2019s a runtime of 26 hours, 45 minutes. This thing is going to get you through your next flight, no problem.\nHowever, if you\u2019re flying a lot and want a MacBook travel companion, I still recommend the 15-inch Air. It continues to be the best MacBook for the vast majority of users. The 14-inch Pro is worth looking at gaming is important \u2014 though I\u2019m still a long way off from recommending any Macs are pure gaming machines. The 16-inch is the pick for those who really need to up their professional game, but still need some portability. For pure desktop power, the Mac Studio and Mac Pro with the M2 Ultra is still king \u2014 until the M3 Ultra rolls out.\nTo state the obvious, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Max is the most powerful Apple laptop, ever. You\u2019ll still get more performance out of the M2 Ultra in the Mac Studio, but for most intents and purposes, this is the desktop of laptops. It\u2019s big, heavy, expensive and powerful.\n\nThis article, authored by Brian Heater, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-06 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":526}

Learn more.\nTV and Soundbar Deals\nSamsung S95C Photograph: Samsung\nThe Samsung S95C (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite TVs, thanks to its quantum dot OLED panel, which gives it perfect black levels and a ridiculously bright image. It even comes with an excellent centered pedestal mount that makes it easy to place in your living room.\nFor gamers, the LG C3 is our top TV pick. Beyond the usual benefits of LG's OLED panels, like perfect black levels, it has features that are appealing for gaming, including a 120-Hz refresh rate for super smooth gameplay and 9.2 millisecond response time to reduce any input lag during fast-paced games.\nOne of the best upgrades you can make to your TV is adding a soundbar to replace the mediocre speakers built into the TV itself. This soundbar from Polk is one of our favorites. It comes with a subwoofer that boosts all those deep, booming notes Christopher Nolan likes so much, and it has several audio presets that can tune the sound based on what type of media you're watching.\nKeyboard Deals\nNZXT Function Photograph: NZXT\nIf you're interested in mechanical keyboards but aren't sure where to start, the NZXT Function (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great jumping-off point. It has a stylish design, and you can configure things like switches and keycaps at the time of purchase. It also comes with tools to modify the keyboard later if you prefer.\nIf you like mechanical keyboards that are loud enough to register on remote seismic detectors, the Roccat Vulcan 121 is our pick for you. The switches on this board are illuminated from below and are semi-clear, giving it a bold look to match its staggeringly loud clicky switches (in a good way).\nThe Logitech G915 is one of my personal favorite keyboards, in no small part due to Logitech's powerful G Hub software that makes automating tasks for productivity dead simple. It's designed for gamers, but it's also useful if you spend a lot of time with creative tools like DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, Blender, Cinema 4D, and other high-end media-production tools.\nRoccat Vulcan II Mini Photograph: Best Buy\nThis is one of our favorite keyboards, with twice as many LEDs as usual. Specifically, it has two LEDs per switch, giving it cosmetic benefits like smoother color animations and the occasional functional benefit, like the ability to indicate when a mute toggle is enabled.\nClick the coupon button to see the discount at checkout. This keyboard is specifically great for fans of the NumPad. It's made of high-quality plastic and has hot-swappable switches, and it comes with satisfying tactile switches. This deal is pretty modest, but this keyboard rarely goes on sale, so it's worth taking a look.\nGaming Mice Deals\nSteelSeries Prime Wireless Mouse Photograph: SteelSeries\nThis mouse is our top pick overall for gaming mice. It's light, comfortable for a wide variety of hand sizes and shapes, and features a couple of extra buttons without becoming cluttered. It is designed with esports professionals in mind, meaning it has nice, clicky buttons, hyper-fast response time, and solid wireless connectivity even around 10 feet away from the receiver.\nThis gaming mouse has a comfortable chassis; extra thumb buttons; and, perhaps most importantly, a modest price. Even when it's not on sale, it's one of our more affordable picks, and this deal just makes it even more accessible.\nOther Tech Deals\nAnker Prime Photograph: Anker\nAnker is kicking off its Black Friday sale early with discounts and a buy-one-get-another-50-percent-off promotion. Make sure you use the listed code to snag the discounted price for each product. We generally like most Anker gear, but standouts include the Anker Prime power bank and the Anker Nano Power Bank. Anker's tiny 511 30-watt charger is also excellent.\nThe Google Pixel Buds A-Series (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) are our top overall earbuds pick. For nearly everyone\u2013even some iPhone users\u2013these check every box. They get up to five hours of battery life (plus an extra 19 hours via recharging in their carrying case), IPX4 water resistance for workouts, and nearly instant pairing with Android devices. This is a solid deal, but they do dip to $59 during major sale events, so it might be worth waiting for Black Friday.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro Photograph: Samsung\nFor Samsung owners, the Galaxy Buds2 Pro (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) are one of our top earbud picks. They produce excellent sound quality, with a super comfortable fit and IPX7 water resistance. They don't have the multi-device connectivity that we like on the Pixel Buds A-Series, but if you mainly use your earbuds with a Samsung phone, these are a great fit for you.\nA slightly more affordable version of the above, the Galaxy Buds2 (9\/10, WIRED Recommends) are another one of our picks for Android users. They're similar in price to the standard AirPods and get five hours of battery life with active noise canceling turned on and an impressive 7.5 hours with it turned off. They come with a charging case and deliver solid bass via their dual-driver array. This deal is only on the olive green color model.\n\nThis article, authored by Eric Ravenscraft, was published by Wired on 2023-10-19 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":527}
{"title":"Amazon\u2019s Tye Brady discusses generative AI, humanoid robots and mobile manipulation","context":"## Amazon\u2019s Tye Brady discusses generative AI, humanoid robots and mobile manipulation\n\nA version of this post first appeared in TechCrunch\u2019s weekly robotics newsletter, Actuator. Subscribe here.\nLast week was a busy one for robotics. We had RoboBusiness in the Bay, ROSCon in New Orleans and Amazon\u2019s Delivering the Future event in Seattle. I ended up choosing the latter, as I\u2019d gotten quite a bit out of the 2022 version of the event, held at a fulfillment center outside of Boston.\nThis year\u2019s event was two days. The first was held inside the Spheres, the big, glass pair of geodesic domes outside the company\u2019s South Lake Union headquarters. The spaces are actually multifloor functional greenhouses, so it\u2019s a bit of a temperature adjustment coming in from Seattle October weather. That said, it\u2019s pretty great being inside a muggy glass structure in the rain \u2014 an opportunity one gets only 150 or so days a year.\nAmazon made a number of announcements on the robotics front this year. At the top of the list was a pair of news items revolving around the Prime Air service. Starting this year, customers in College Station, Texas, will be able to get medications from Amazon Pharmacy delivered via drone.\nNext year, the service will launch in a third U.S. city, as well as yet-to-be-named spots in the U.K. and Germany. The service had its share of ups and downs over the years (so to speak), including layoffs in 2020 and company-wide job cuts earlier this year. Amazon is, understandably, approaching the project with baby steps. It\u2019s currently limited to one city in Texas and another in California.\nAside from difficulties scaling, there\u2019s also a whole bunch of regulation to contend with. Amazon has worked with local and national governing bodies to ensure the same day delivery service complies. In a lot of ways, this is a bit of a brave new world, and there are bound to be some stumbles on the way to a potential future where delivery drones from companies like Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s Wing are a common sight in the skies above our heads.\nOne thing Amazon has going for it on the pharmacy front is the fact that it doesn\u2019t trade in narcotics, meaning that opioids won\u2019t be flying over anyone\u2019s heads. Also, the company is going to start rolling out the new MK30 drone, which it claims is significantly quieter than the last model. Again, this is an important thing if we\u2019re planning to have these things buzzing around the skies.\nAlso worth pointing out is the arrival of the brand-new first-party system, Sequoia. The company notes:\nSequoia allows us to identify and store inventory we receive at our fulfillment centers up to 75% faster than we can today. This means we can list items for sale on Amazon.com more quickly, benefiting both sellers and customers. When orders are placed, Sequoia also reduces the time it takes to process an order through a fulfillment center by up to 25%, which improves our shipping predictability and increases the number of goods we can offer for Same-Day or Next-Day shipping. Obviously this is all a matter of reducing delivery times \u2014 also the driving factor in the company\u2019s Prime Air investments. The company has already set next- and same-day delivery expectations in many areas, so one wonders when we arrive at the point where any additional time savings becomes effectively negligible. I suspect if you were to put the question to Amazon, they would say \u201cnever.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t get to that specific question during my time with Amazon Robotics chief technologist, Tye Brady. Instead, our conversation primarily focused on three important (I think) topics. The first is the company\u2019s pilots with Agility\u2019s Digit systems. I wrote about this a couple of times last week, including a piece titled \u201cHumanoid robots face a major test with Amazon\u2019s Digit pilots\u201d that went up over the weekend.\nI do genuinely believe there are going to be a lot of eyes on this thing. It\u2019s not that I think it\u2019s the end of Agility if Amazon opts not to extend a contract. It\u2019s more that if Amazon decides to pursue it further, it\u2019s going to cause a lot more companies to take bipedal\/humanoid robots a lot more seriously. I\u2019ve been saying the whole time that I\u2019m holding off on judging the efficacy of humanoids until we see more in the field, and Amazon clearly feels the same way.\nThe company operates at such an unfathomable scale (have you visited a regional fulfillment center lately?), that it truly needs to feel absolutely confident before it begins implementing new technologies into its workflows.\nAnother noteworthy piece of news is an Amazon, MIT\/Ipsos partnership designed to gauge what both workers and consumers think about industrial robots.\n\u201cThe key to effective teamwork is building a shared understanding of what our partners will do and what they will need to be successful,\u201d says MIT\u2019s Julie Shah. \u201cOur research shows that the best way to optimize human-robot team performance is to develop robots that are active collaborators in helping a human to learn about their capabilities, limitations and behaviors.\u201d\nI do think human perception of robots is a question worth asking, but I would love to see a study with such financial and academic resources digging more deeply into questions around short- and long-term displacements.\nDuring his presentation, Brady addressed the jobs question accordingly:\nWe have more than 750,000 mobile robots in our operations and thousands of other robotic systems that help move, sort, identify and package customer orders. It\u2019s taken us more than 10 years to reach this scale. During that time, Amazon has hired hundreds of thousands of employees to work in our operations. We take a purpose-driven approach to how we design and deploy technology at our facilities and we consistently prioritize using robots to support safety and ease everyday tasks for our employees.\nOne other bit before we move on to the interview. At the top of the second day, an Amazon rep noted, \u201cEvery one of our teams is working on building generative AI applications.\u201d That jumped out at me, for obvious reasons, but as the event pressed on into specifics around drone and robotics plans, the topic largely fell away.\nI kicked off my conversation with Tye Brady with a few questions on the subject.\nThe subject of generative AI came up earlier in the day, but it was largely absent from the robotics conversations. How is your team thinking about the subject?\nI\u2019ll talk about machine learning and then generative AI. I think that Amazon has been at the forefront of machine learning for decades now. As you can imagine, early on with Jeff [Bezos], if you needed to predict where inventory needed to go, one person couldn\u2019t do that. We\u2019ve involved machine learning as part of that, from the get-go. AWS has the Machine Learning Toolkit. Now that involves generative AI, and there\u2019s over 100,000 businesses that are using that toolset today. We\u2019re seeing where it\u2019s going. We have what we call Codewhisperer that will help us in our actual coding of the robotic systems.\nReal language?\nExactly right. If you\u2019re trying to do this procedure or routine, it suggests you can write your subroutine this way. Cut and paste it. Very straightforward, very easy. It helps with the overall productivity. In robotics, generative AI has a lot of promise. One example that\u2019s in my lab today is that we generate synthetic packages that are virtually indistinguishable from any picture you see. Generative AI will generate scenes, like what the robot would see with the right lighting condition. In simulation, we can pick up those generated packages with real-world contact force, all the way through with the actual perception system that\u2019s in the field. We can even damage a corner in different ways to make sure our detection algorithms are actually working the way they should.\nAnother one is grasp affordance. That\u2019s a term we use in order to pick up an object and what\u2019s the orientation and the pose of the end effector that you want in order to grab that object? Generative AI has a lot of possibilities there. As you can imagine, a set of basic primitives, where we then give a generative AI agent all of the options that we can do with our robotic end effectors. Why don\u2019t we stitch those together in a meaningful way?\nTo help determine the best method for picking.\nExactly. That ultimately helps our designers determine and algorithmically prove that was the best method. The theme here is that generative AI has a lot of promise, particularly in influencing our designers to make a better system.\nI was recently speaking with Daniela Rus, and she was excited by the concept of using generative AI to literally design robots.\nThe dynamics of the robots, to literally move the robots \u2014 path planning to actually figure out how to get the right angles \u2014 generative AI is incredible at that. We\u2019re seeing a lot of promise with that today.\nWhat about real-world problem-solving?\nIt\u2019s another good example. I want to be careful on generative AI versus the machine learning systems that we have. We have what we call \u201cflow\u201d inside the building. We have machine learning systems that understand what line needs what at what time and can help divert the right material flow to the right stations, for example. We have machine learning systems that I think of as air traffic controllers for all the mobile drives that we have.\nFleet management.\nFleet management, task management, work management. On top of that, machine learning has completely changed computer vision, like the segmentation of objects \u2014 knowing where one object ends and the next begins.\nYou\u2019re using simulation, but there are always things you\u2019re not going to account for. I\u2019ve heard it said that generative is potentially useful for having robots make decisions for scenarios they haven\u2019t encountered on the fly.\nYeah. That\u2019s been part of robotics for decades, the ability to make real-time decisions. It\u2019s something that, even prior to generative AI, enabled the goods-to-person fulfillment systems we had. Even with Sequoia, there\u2019s real time sensing capabilities that are built in that can detect objects and people. That needs to be in the robot, and then there\u2019s stuff that we hold in AWS in the cloud that has the higher level of logic. It\u2019s exciting to think about the capabilities of generative AI, and I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. We always think in practical real-world examples inside of Amazon Robotics. But we\u2019re so far pretty interested, particularly if we give primitives to our systems and then allow generative AI to stitch those together in ways that can make those real-time decisions. That has proven very useful, both in our mobility and manipulation solutions.\nAround April, you announced that Agility would be one of the first recipients in the Industrial Innovation Fund. Is potential warehouse integration a piece of making those investments?\nThe Innovation Fund is really about exploring what\u2019s possible out there. It\u2019s about understanding practical real-world examples as well. We are interested in walking robots. I find that very interesting, the ability to move on different terrains is interesting. We\u2019re also interested in what works \u2014 and frankly what doesn\u2019t work \u2014 about it. The humanoid form is really interesting. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing. We\u2019re experimentalists at heart. We\u2019re gonna figure that out. We\u2019re going to do a pilot and see how that works out. We\u2019re happy that they\u2019re a part of our fund, but we also have other companies in the fund where we learned from, and if we want, we can make a larger investment in it. I\u2019m not necessary saying that if we fund something, it\u2019s going to be inside our processes. It\u2019s very early stages.\nWhat does \u201cvery early stage\u201d mean here?\nWe\u2019re learning about the function and utility. What\u2019s possible here? What\u2019s hype? What\u2019s reality? Would this possibly scale? I think a lot of folks have difficulty understaning the scale in which we operate. It can\u2019t work 99% of the time, because a 1% defect rate is a huge number inside any of our buildings.\nIt\u2019s clear looking at your progress on projects like Proteus that the goal is to move automation outside the cage.\nWe\u2019re moving outside the cage. What we can see with those investments is in 2022, as compared to manual buildings, we\u2019ve reduced the recordable injury rate by 15%.\nWith these sorts of deals like Agility, do you buy a number of robots outright for the testing? Are you leasing them?\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all. We do a case-by-case basis. [Amazon declined to comment further on the arrangement.]\nOne of the big appeals of bipedal robots is their ability to operate in brownfield settings, but Amazon doesn\u2019t really have that problem.\nOur interest in systems like Agility is in the bipedal nature. The walking nature of that. Whether it\u2019s two legs, four legs, or it\u2019s rolling on wheels. If it performs that mobility function, we have interest, because we know that we need to move goods.\nBut given Amazon\u2019s immense resources, you\u2019re able to build factories, ground up.\nThat\u2019s a good observation. The Sequoia system that you see is actually built for the height of our prior Kiva pods. If we wanted to retrofit buildings, we have that capability. We can containerize that building to bring the safety and productivity benefits to existing sites. We can retrofit brownfields that we\u2019ve already built with the Sequoia system. We have greenfield and brownfield. Not everything is a greenfield.\n750,000 is a lot of robots.\nAll manufactured by Amazon and built in the state of Massachusetts.\nDo you break those numbers down further?\nThose are just the AMRs. We also have a fleet of robots that sort packages. We have a fleet of robots that manipulate packages, like our Robin fleet that\u2019s inducted more than 2 billion packages.\nYou mentioned mobile manipulation earlier. Where is your team with that concept?\nIt\u2019s super exciting. I think those core fundamentals that I talked about, the verbs that I think we\u2019re achieving a world class mastering in, when you start to bring those together in interesting combination, some really unique things happen. I think that we are world leaders when it comes to mobile robots out there. No one has the fleet of sure mobile industrial robots that are out there and controlling them at scale. And now we are very much in the business of manipulating not only packages, but also objects. And to bring those together, I think it\u2019s exciting to see the possibilities.\nWhat does mobile manipulation look like?\nI think it\u2019s probably what you think.\nMounting an arm to an AMR?\nYeah. With the Agility robot, you can think of that as a mobile manipulator. That has interest to us, right. The mode of mobility has particular interest to us because we just have not done a lot of work in bipedal robots. So that\u2019s why we have interest in Agility. But absolutely, if we can combine that with identification systems with manipulation systems, sortation system, storage systems have anything and everything that we will do to innovate for our customer, right anything and everything will do to improve the safety for our employees.\nIt\u2019s a hard problem.\nIt\u2019s a very, very hard problem, when you\u2019re talking about millions and millions of different objects. Of all different sizes, and scales and weights in dimensionality, the ability to not only grasp the item, but also identify the item, the ability to also look for damage on the item is pretty incredible. I want to eliminate every menial, mundane, repetitive job out there. So, if I can automate that, and allow our employees to focus more on what matters, on higher level tasking, that\u2019s a total win. This ties into the MIT thing, too. The way it\u2019s played out is, you replace a certain thing. So the jobs changed. The jobs exist, but it\u2019s a big sweeping change.\nIf I visit the labs, I\u2019ll see these sorts of experiments in action.\nYeah. If you were to go to outside of Nashville today, you would see Proteus working with our Cardinal arm. You\u2019d get to see the interoperability. We have the Proteus drives moving carts to the outbound docks. If you were to go down to Hou 6 just outside of Houston, you would see Sequoia fulfilling orders today, right in time for holiday shopping.\nWhat role do people play in that picture?\nPeople will always be at the center of a robotics universe. We know more robots, more jobs that we see through the productivity increases that we have.\n[The MIT study] sounds like it\u2019s largely about perception and what people think of robots, rather than job numbers specifically.\nI\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s wherever [MIT professor Julie Shah] wants to take it. We have a lot of interest in how people perceive robotics, because people will be using our robotics.

{"title":"Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president","context":"## Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president\n\nA judge ruled Tuesday that Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame and the White House.\nJudge Arthur Engoron, ruling in a civil lawsuit brought by New York\u2019s attorney general, found that the former president and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing.\nEngoron ordered that some of Trump\u2019s business licenses be rescinded as punishment and said he would continue to have an independent monitor oversee the Trump Organization\u2019s operations.\nA Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. Trump has long insisted he did nothing wrong.\nThe decision, days before the start of a non-jury trial in Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit, is the strongest repudiation yet of Trump\u2019s carefully coiffed image as a wealthy and shrewd real estate mogul turned political powerhouse.\nBeyond mere bragging about his riches, Trump, his company and key executives repeatedly lied about them on his annual financial statements, reaping rewards such as favorable loan terms and lower insurance premiums, Engoron found.\nThose tactics crossed a line and violated the law, the judge said, rejecting Trump\u2019s contention that a disclaimer on the financial statements absolved him of any wrongdoing.\n\u201cIn defendants\u2019 world: rent regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party\u2019s lies,\u201d Engoron wrote in his 35-page ruling. \u201cThat is a fantasy world, not the real world.\u201d\nManhattan prosecutors had looked into bringing a criminal case over the same conduct but declined to do so, leaving James to sue Trump and seek penalties that could disrupt his and his family\u2019s ability to do business in the state.\nEngoron\u2019s ruling, in a phase of the case known as summary judgment, resolves the key claim in James\u2019 lawsuit, but six others remain.\nEngoron is slated to hold a non-jury trial starting Oct. 2 before deciding on those claims and any punishments he may impose. James is seeking $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump doing business in New York, his home state. The trial could last into December, Engoron has said.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers had asked the judge to throw out the case, which he denied. They contend that James wasn\u2019t legally allowed to file the lawsuit because there isn\u2019t any evidence that the public was harmed by Trump\u2019s actions. They also argued that many of the allegations in the lawsuit were barred by the statute of limitations.\nEngoron, noting that he had \u201cemphatically rejected\u201d those arguments earlier in the case, equated them to the \u201ctime-loop in the film \u2018Groundhog Day.'\u201d\nJames, a Democrat, sued Trump and the Trump Organization a year ago, alleging a pattern of duplicity that she dubbed \u201cthe art of the steal,\u201d a twist on the title of Trump\u2019s 1987 business memoir \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\nThe lawsuit accused Trump and his company of routinely inflating the value of assets like skyscrapers, golf courses and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, padding his bottom line by billions.\nAmong the allegations were that Trump claimed his Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan \u2014 a three-story penthouse replete with gold-plated fixtures \u2014 was nearly three times its actual size and valued the property at $327 million. No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.\nTrump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million \u2014 more than 10 times a more reasonable estimate of its worth. Trump\u2019s figure for the private club and residence was based on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use, but deed terms prohibit that, James said.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing, arguing in sworn testimony for the case that it didn\u2019t matter what he put on his financial statements because they have a disclaimer that says they shouldn\u2019t be trusted. He told James at the April deposition, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a case and you should drop this case.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know the banks were fully paid? Do you know the banks made a lot of money?\u201d Trump testified. \u201cDo you know I don\u2019t believe I ever got even a default notice, and even during COVID, the banks were all paid? And yet you\u2019re suing on behalf of banks, I guess. It\u2019s crazy. The whole case is crazy.\u201d\nEngoron rejected that argument when the defense previously sought to have the case thrown out.\nThe judge said the disclaimer on the financial statements \u201cmakes abundantly clear that Mr. Trump was fully responsible for the information contained within\u201d them and that \u201callowing blanket disclaimers to insulate liars from liability would completely undercut\u201d the \u201cimportant function\u201d that such statements serve \u201cin the real world.\u201d\nJames\u2019 lawsuit is one of several legal headaches for Trump as he campaigns for a return to the White House in 2024. He has been indicted four times in the last six months \u2014 accused in Georgia and Washington, D.C., of plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss, in Florida of hoarding classified documents, and in Manhattan of falsifying business records related to hush money paid on his behalf.\nThe Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud last year in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. The company was fined $1.6 million. One of the executives, Trump\u2019s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty and served five months in jail. He is a defendant in James\u2019 lawsuit and gave sworn deposition testimony for the case in May.\nJames\u2019 lawsuit does not carry the potential of prison time, but could complicate his ability to transact real estate deals. It could also stain his legacy as a developer.\nJames has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years, among other sanctions. The $250 million in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said.\nJames, who campaigned for office as a Trump critic and watchdog, started scrutinizing his business practices in March 2019 after his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank while trying to obtain financing to buy the NFL\u2019s Buffalo Bills.\nJames\u2019 office previously sued Trump for misusing his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests. Trump was ordered to pay $2 million to an array of charities as a fine and the charity, the Trump Foundation, was shut down.\n\nThis article, authored by Michael R.

{"title":"The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer","context":"## The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer\n\nThousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president\u2019s 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4.5 billion. Bloomberg\u2019s calculation has consistently been below Trump\u2019s figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he\u2019s accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his \u201cbrand\u201d adds. He also said that banks didn\u2019t rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t a very important element in banks\u2019 decision-making process,\u201d Trump told the court. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll explain that as this trial goes along.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at New York state\u2019s valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg\u2019s own approach to assessing the assets.\nMar-a-Lago Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US612.1 million , Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US240 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US27.6 million It\u2019s fair to say that Trump\u2019s most famous property these days is no longer New York\u2019s Trump Tower but his Mar-a-Lago Club, the historic Palm Beach estate built by Marjorie Merriweather Post in the 1920s that he now calls home. New York\u2019s valuation of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate has raised eyebrows. Credit: AP The sprawling resort has been at the centre of some publicised post-presidency scandals, from classified documents being kept in one of its bathrooms to the location where Trump is said to have shared nuclear submarine secrets with Australian businessman Anthony Pratt \u2014 something that Trump denies.\nIt\u2019s also a major focus in Trump\u2019s fraud lawsuit. Trump made a series of agreements with Palm Beach County and the National Trust for Historic Preservation for Mar-a-Lago to be used only as a club, giving up any development rights. Consequently, Palm Beach values the property as a business on its tax rolls. In 2021, the county assessed it at $US27.6 million, lower than comparable residential properties. New York State argues that this appraisal is the one Trump should have been using. New York\u2019s estimated value \u201cwas a shock to the real estate community and anybody with any understanding of the island and its values,\u201d said Liza Pulitzer, a real estate agent at Brown Harris Stevens and a Palm Beach native. \u201cIt could easily fetch $US500 million or more.\u201d\nThat assumes a buyer views it as a single-family residence. It\u2019s currently not zoned for such use, though Trump is able to reside there through a loophole designating himself an employee. Trump\u2019s legal team engaged an expert witness who argued that a future buyer could do the same thing. And if they didn\u2019t like the idea of sharing their property with others, they could reduce the club to a membership of one. Still, it\u2019s unclear if Palm Beach would allow that without a change to its zoning status. Historically, Mar-a-Lago never made much money for the Trump Organisation, but that seems to be changing. It took in about $US41 million in revenue last year, according to Trump\u2019s most recent ethics disclosure, compared with $US21 million in 2019. Bloomberg values Mar-a-Lago at $US240 million, based on a combination of comparable residential property sales in the area as well as its value as a business, reflecting some uncertainty around its future status. That uncertainty isn\u2019t shared by everyone. If the city and county allowed it, \u201cthere is no reason why it wouldn\u2019t be able to converted to a full-time private residence,\u201d said Eli Beracha, director of the Hollo School of Real Estate at Florida International University.\nTrump\u2019s Fifth Avenue penthouse Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US131.3 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US40 million, New York valuation: No current estimate available Trump\u2019s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years, so it\u2019s not surprising that one of the world\u2019s masters of hyperbole exaggerated its size for most of that time. Trump\u2019s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years. Credit: AP Between 2011 and 2016, Trump valued his apartment based on it being 30,000 square feet (2,787 square metres) in size \u2014 almost triple its actual measurement of 10,996 square feet. Because of this, New York State arrived at a valuation that was about a third of Trump\u2019s in those years. They haven\u2019t provided a more recent estimate.\nSpace inflation wasn\u2019t the only issue. Between 2014 and 2015, Trump increased the value of the apartment to $US327 million from $US200 million. The prosecution argues that was to mask a drop in the value of one of his other properties. \u201cA discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,\u201d Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a September ruling. \u2018The company has never been stronger and never been better.\u2019 Eric Trump Bloomberg values the property using recent Trump Tower sales, as well as those of comparable Manhattan penthouses. While some splashy residences in much newer buildings on so-called Billionaires Row have listed for well in excess of $US100 million, they typically boast higher ceilings, more up-to-date finishes, contemporary layouts, outdoor space and better views. A better comparison would be a 9450-square-foot penthouse in Olympic Tower, five blocks south on Fifth Avenue, which has been on and off the market for $US35 million since 2016. Then there\u2019s Carl Icahn\u2019s 14,000-square-foot penthouse at Museum Tower on West 53rd Street. It was listed for $US35 million in 2019 before he attempted to split the space and sell it as two separate apartments. Both were eventually delisted.\nIt\u2019s possible Trump would get a higher price because of his name. \u201cThere would be a Trump premium because the person that would want that property is likely to be a Trump supporter,\u201d Beracha said. But it\u2019s also likely that the association with Trump would turn off some buyers. Trump Park Avenue Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US90.9 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US86.4 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US80 million The residential condo tower on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, formerly the Hotel Delmonico, isn\u2019t one of Trump\u2019s best-known buildings, but it\u2019s been the source of some significant asset inflations, according to the prosecution.\nIts value to Trump mostly stems from unsold condo units that are owned by the Trump Organisation and rented out. A varying number have been rent-stabilised, meaning tenants pay below market rates. Typically, these apartments are valued at a discount because tenants can stay indefinitely, sometimes even passing them on to children. In 2010, 12 rent-stabilised apartments owned by Trump were valued at an average of $US62,500 each in an appraisal provided by a real estate company. The following year, Trump valued them at $US4.1 million each \u2014 more than 65 times greater. Trump has continued to value stabilised apartments in the building at market rates, including in his 2021 statement of financial condition. Rent-stabilised units \u201cwith a positive cash flow are often valued at 15-25 cents a dollar of the open market value, versus single digits for negative cash flow,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser Miller Samuel. Still, Trump\u2019s optimism was shown to be at least partially justified. By 2021, only five of the 12 apartments remained rent stabilised. The prosecution also claims two additional non-stabilised apartments in the building were overvalued because Trump ignored an option his daughter, Ivanka Trump, had to buy them at a price lower than the market value he used.\n40 Wall Street Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US664 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US270 million, New York\u2019s valuation: No current estimate available In valuing his flagship lower Manhattan office tower, Trump consistently ignored more conservative appraisals he\u2019d received from professionals, New York State argues. Trump has been accused of significantly over-valuing his flagship downtown New York property. Credit: Bloomberg For example, 40 Wall Street was appraised by a real estate company at $US200 million in 2011 and $US220 million in 2012. Despite this, Trump valued the property in financial statements at $US524.7 million and $US527.2 million, respectively, for those years.\nBloomberg uses a capitalisation of net income approach in coming up with an estimate. Valuations for commercial offices across the board have taken a hit in the past 18 months amid rising interest rates and a lacklustre corporate leasing market. But 40 Wall Street has its own unique problems. Tenant departures meant occupancy slid to 77 per cent in June, down from 98 per cent in 2015. Its net operating income is only 61 per cent of what was projected by underwriters. Loading \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of leasing velocity down there,\u201d said Albert Sultan, a broker at Kassin Sabbagh Realty. The financial district used to offer a lower cost for tenants, but with Midtown rents declining, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to go downtown.\u201d The property is also subject to a ground lease that resets in 2032 at either 6 per cent of the land value or 85 per cent of its rent in the prior year. Based on current rent, that means the ground lease would jump to $US30 million from about $US2.6 million now.\n\nThis article, authored by Tom Maloney, was published by The Age on 2023-11-07 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":530}
{"title":"M.L.B. Superstar Shohei Ohtani to Sign $700 Million Deal With Dodgers","context":"## M.L.B. Superstar Shohei Ohtani to Sign $700 Million Deal With Dodgers\n\nShohei Ohtani\u2019s singular pursuit of history, one man\u2019s quest to rewrite the baseball world\u2019s understanding of what is possible, reached another summit on Saturday when he agreed to the largest contract in the annals of major North American team sports, a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, his agency CAA announced.\nAdvertisement\nOhtani announced his decision on Instagram. The deal ends years of feverish speculation about Ohtani\u2019s future. Ohtani, a 29-year-old two-way sensation, has captivated the industry since he left Japan for Major League Baseball heading into the 2018 season. He has done things that appeared impossible in the modern era, feats that harkened back to Babe Ruth. As he traveled the country with the Los Angeles Angels this past summer, fans serenaded him with recruiting pitches. When he entered free agency, a dozen teams lined up, curious to see if they could meet his eye.\nOnly one team could secure Ohtani\u2019s services. He will now be compensated for both his immense talent and his unparalleled star power. His contract eclipsed the $360 million record for free agents set last winter by New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge and also surpassed the record-setting $426.5 million extension from Ohtani\u2019s former Angels teammate Mike Trout. His achievement exceeded even those outside of baseball, topping the $450 million contract inked by Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Ohtani has outpaced even soccer star Lionel Messi\u2019s $674 million contract \u2014 signed in 2017 when he was with FC Barcelona.\nHis individual brilliance was not enough to lift the Angels into the postseason. With the Dodgers, Ohtani will now have an opportunity to add collective hardware to his trophy case. The Dodgers have won the National League West in 10 of the past 11 seasons, topped 100 victories in five of the past six full seasons and won the World Series in 2020. Ohtani has never played a postseason game in his big-league career.\n\u201cMy sense is that he wants to be the best ever,\u201d said St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Lars Nootbaar, who played with Ohtani last spring in the World Baseball Classic, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think he would ever publicly say that.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nDeferrals effectively lower the average annual value of Ohtani\u2019s contract, giving the Dodgers greater flexibility as they attempt to navigate Major League Baseball\u2019s luxury-tax system, which includes penalties for teams that exceed certain thresholds.\nA team\u2019s luxury tax-payroll is calculated according to players\u2019 average annual values, and discounted by deferrals. Mookie Betts, for example, has $115 million deferred in his 12-year, $365 million contract with the Dodgers. Under the league\u2019s calculations, the deferrals lower his average annual value from $30.4 million to $25.5 million.\nDodgers officials declined comment when asked if Ohtani had taken a physical, the final step before a deal can become official.\nSignificant questions linger about Ohtani\u2019s future. He will not pitch in 2024 as he recovers from a September operation to repair his right elbow\u2019s ulnar collateral ligament. He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2018. Neither Ohtani, who has not taken questions from reporters since August, nor his agent, Nez Balelo, nor the Angels have disclosed the exact nature of the second surgery, but the Los Angeles Times has reported it was a second Tommy John procedure.\nBalelo has stressed that Ohtani remains committed to both pitching and hitting in the future. \u201cShohei loves to pitch,\u201d Balelo told reporters in September. Ohtani will attempt to return to the mound in 2025. His camp has not revealed at what point Ohtani would consider giving up his dual career and focusing on learning a different position. Since he was a teenager, Ohtani has ignored suggestions that he focus on only one pursuit.\nOhtani demonstrated his potential as the American League Rookie of the Year in 2018, but his two-way hopes were delayed after his first elbow surgery. It was not until 2021 that the full flower of his ability bloomed. He has won the American League MVP in two of the past three seasons; in the intervening season, he led all American League pitchers in strikeout rate while hitting 34 home runs with an .875 OPS. To create a comparison for him involves inventions that sound freakish. \u201cIt\u2019s like if Judge went out and was a 20-game winner as well,\u201d former teammate Kole Calhoun said.\nOhtani will not pitch in 2024 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, but his agent stressed he\u2019s committed to returning to the mound. (Photo: Michael Owens \/ Getty Images)\nOhtani is committed to being a starting pitcher. If he cannot stay healthy enough for that role, he could aid his new team as a reliever. He closed the final game of the World Baseball Classic, securing the crown for Japan by striking out Trout. His four-seam fastball averaged nearly 97 mph in 2023; the velocity of the pitch figures to improve in short bursts.\nAdvertisement\nEven if Ohtani never pitches again, his value as a hitter is immense. In 1920, his first season exclusively as a hitter, Ruth led the American League in homers, on-base percentage and slugging percentage. In 2023, while still making 23 starts with a 3.14 ERA, Ohtani led the American League in the same three categories as Ruth. He swatted 44 homers with a career-best 1.066 OPS. He did this while making starts and dealing with a torn ligament in his elbow.\nOnly one stage remains for Ohtani. He has never played a postseason game in the majors. As the Angels foundered in recent years, Ohtani became more vocal about his desire to play for a winner. Now he has the chance to make a different kind of history.\nRequired reading\n(Photo: Stacy Revere \/ Getty Images)\n\nThis article, authored by The New York Times, was published by The New York Times on 2023-12-09 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":531}
{"title":"India to be one of world's fastest growing economies over next decade","context":"## India to be one of world's fastest growing economies over next decade\n\nThe IMF. in its latest update. has said that India is one of the large emerging economies that has been doing better than expected.\nThe IMF said India has been doing better for a while now and that India is, in fact, one of the growth engines in the world economy at this point.\nThe IMF said important divergences are appearing. The slowdown is more pronounced in advanced economies than in emerging markets and developing economies. Among the advanced economies, the US has been revised up, with resilient consumption and investment, while the euro area has been revised down, as tighter monetary policy and the energy crisis took a toll.\nThere is divergence also among emerging markets and developing economies, with China facing growing headwinds, while Brazil, India. and Russia are revised up.\nAfter two years of rapid economic growth in 2021 and 2022, the near-term economic outlook for India is for continued rapid expansion during 2023-24, underpinned by strong growth in private consumption and investment, S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a recent update.\nThe acceleration of foreign direct investment inflows into India over the past decade reflects the favourable long-term growth outlook for the Indian economy, helped by a youthful demographic profile and rapidly rising urban household incomes.\nIndia's nominal GDP measured in USD terms is forecast to rise from $3.5 trillion in 2022 to $7.3 trillion by 2030. This rapid pace of economic expansion would result in the size of the Indian GDP exceeding the Japanese GDP by 2030, making India the second largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.\nBy 2022, the size of the Indian GDP had already become larger than the GDP of the UK and also France. By 2030, India's GDP is also forecast to surpass Germany, the research said.\nThe long-term outlook for the Indian economy is supported by a number of key growth drivers. An important positive factor for India is its large and fast-growing middle class, which is helping to drive consumer spending.\nThe rapidly growing Indian domestic consumer market as well as its large industrial sector have made India an increasingly important investment destination for a wide range of multinationals in many sectors, including manufacturing, infrastructure and services, the report said.\nThe digital transformation of India that is currently underway is expected to accelerate the growth of e-commerce, changing the retail consumer market landscape over the next decade. This is attracting leading global multinationals in technology and e-commerce to the Indian market.\nBy 2030, 1.1 billion people in India will have internet access, more than doubling from the estimated 500 million internet users in 2020. The rapid growth of e-commerce and the shift to 4G and 5G smartphone technology will boost home-grown unicorns.\nThe large increase in FDI inflows to India that has been evident over the past five years is also continuing with strong momentum evident even during the pandemic years of 2020-2022.\nIndia's strong FDI inflows have been boosted by large inflows of investments from global technology MNCs such as Google and Facebook that are attracted to India's large, fast-growing domestic consumer market, as well as a strong upturn in foreign direct investment inflows from manufacturing firms.\nOverall, India is expected to continue to be one of the world's fastest growing economies over the next decade. This will make India one of the most important long-term growth markets for multinationals in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing industries such as autos, electronics and chemicals to services industries such as banking, insurance, asset management, health care and information technology, it added.\nBrahma Chellaney, professor of strategic studies at the New Delhi-based Center for Policy Research, wrote in a recent article that as India's geopolitical, economic and cultural clout grows, so does its global footprint. China's \u201cdecline,\u201d as some have begun to call the conclusion of the country's four-decade-long economic boom, opens new opportunities for the Indian economy and other developing and emerging countries.\nEarlier this year, India reached another milestone when its population officially surpassed that of China, which had been the world's most populous country for more than 300 years.\nWhile China's shrinking, rapidly aging population is likely to impede economic growth and may curtail its geopolitical ambitions, India -- one of the world's youngest countries, with a median age of 28.2 -- is poised to reap a huge demographic dividend, the article said.\nBut the driving force behind India's emergence as a major global power is its rapid economic growth. While India's gross domestic product is still smaller than China's, the country is currently the world's fastest-growing major economy and is projected to account for 12.9 per cent of global growth over the next five years, surpassing the United States' 11.3 per cent share, the article said.\nThe seventeenth round of the FICCI-IBA survey was carried out for the period January to June 2023. A total of 24 banks including public sector, private sector and foreign banks participated in the survey. These banks together represent about 79 per cent of the banking industry, as classified by asset size.\nThe Indian economy posted an impressive 7.2 per cent growth in the financial year ended March 2023 and 7.8 per cent in first quarter of current fiscal year. Credit growth also continued to rise, signalling robust demand conditions in the Indian economy, as well as banks' improved appetite towards retail borrowers.\nThe health of the banking sector has witnessed an encouraging turnaround, marked by healthier bank balance sheets and gross NPA ratio at a decade low.\nThe survey findings show that long term credit demand has seen continued growth in sectors such as Infrastructure, textiles and chemicals. food processing and metals.\nIron & steel have also witnessed accelerated long-term loan disbursements in the past six months. Infrastructure is witnessing an increase in credit flow with 67 per cent of the respondents indicating an increase in long-term loans as against 57 per cent in the previous round.\nThe survey suggests that the outlook on expectation on growth of non-food industry credit over next six months is optimistic with 42 per cent of the participating banks expecting non-food industry credit growth to be above 12 per cent (as compared to 36 per cent in the previous round).\nRajan Jain, Head, Credit Research, SBI Caps, said in a note that whether the yield curve dynamics mean the US is moving to a structurally higher-rate economy vs. post GFC normal remains a moot question, with important implications for investment demand and system risk.\nThese movements have had a cascading effect on global economies, which have seen routs in their respective bond markets, besides a fresh round of currency depreciation.\nEmerging market economies with large volumes of USD denominated debt are especially vulnerable as they could be caught in a vicious circle of their external debt (in local currency terms) ballooning due to strong DXY and their servicing ability being impaired by tepid economic activity owing to high rates. Even advanced economies have felt the heat, and the ECB etc. have maintained a hawkish narrative, Jain said.\nAnother developing story seems to be the greenshoots of recovery in China backed by domestic consumption in the Golden week, and tourism related to the Asian Games. For now, these seem to buttressed on stimulus and base effects as China is now fully open.\nThe long-term trajectory remains to be seen. In any case, for now this has provided a floor for commodity prices, especially base metals. Fickle commodity prices will also be victims of fresh geopolitical tensions in West Asia, which has pushed up Brent crude. Food prices could also play truant with climate change affecting cropping area worldwide: sugar and rice prices are booming, the note said.\nIn this challenging environment, Indian real GDP growth, estimated to be 6.2 per cent y\/y in real terms in FY24, is resilient. High frequency indicators suggest strong construction and infrastructure activity, and soaring urban demand.\nManufacturing production has been unusually strong in Q2FY24, especially in infrastructure-oriented structures such as cement and steel. Power supply grew vastly in Q2 after a tepid Q1, helped by a dry August 2023 and buzzing industrial activity.\nBoth the Union and States have front ended capex in H1FY24, and this remains the engine of expansion. Capital expenditure was up 48 per cent y\/y for the Union in the same period. Reports suggest capex of major states was also up 45 per cent y\/y in 5MFY24.\nCarrying forward this capex in H2FY24 would be important to sustain the multiplier. The fiscal deficit for the 5MFY24 stood at 36% of the FY24BE. Gross direct tax revenue experienced a substantial increase of 18 per cent y\/y up to October 9, allaying concerns of fiscal slippage, the note said.\n\nThis article, authored by zee business, was published by Zee Business on 2023-10-14 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":532}
{"title":"Diablo 4 season 2\u2019s biggest draw is its quality-of-life updates","context":"## Diablo 4 season 2\u2019s biggest draw is its quality-of-life updates\n\nDiablo 4\u2019s Season of Blood brings some cool new vampire powers into the fold, but the real star of the action game\u2019s second season is its sweeping quality-of-life changes. Players will now have an easier time leveling up, gaining quality loot, and just navigating the open world of Sanctuary.\nGame director Joe Shely and associate game director Joe Piepiora sat down to do a roundtable interview with Polygon and other outlets ahead of Blizzard\u2019s Oct. 4th livestream, and gave additional context to Nightmare Dungeon changes, Renown, and more.\nOne of the most notable changes for players in Diablo 4\u2019s second season update will be an increase in experience gains. Blizzard claims players will be able to reach the level cap of 100 about 40% faster than in Season of the Malignant \u2014 which already increased experience gains compared to Diablo 4\u2019s launch. This process should be much smoother for players as well, as monsters will now match their levels between 55 and 75.\nShely told the panel that last season, players set a goal for themselves: Get to level 100. However, many players found that they were never able to hit that milestone because XP gains were so slow. This change should allow more players to reach the level cap each season, allowing them to play with a truly maxed-out build.\nAs for how players will spend their time at max level and where they\u2019ll be able to earn some of the game\u2019s most powerful items, enter the five new endgame bosses: Grigoire The Galvanic Saint, the Echo of Varshan, The Beast in the Ice, the Dark Master, and the Echo of Duriel. Each boss has its own laundry list of busy work for players to complete in order to unlock their encounter \u2014 such as completing Nightmare Dungeons above level 30 or completing Grim Favors \u2014 but they also come with Unique rewards. That\u2019s Unique with a capital U.\nBecause the bosses each offer their own pool of Unique items, this process makes farming for that special helmet that much easier. Instead of running dungeons and hoping the desired item drops, players can just gather all the materials, kill The Beast in the Ice, and then do it all again if they don\u2019t get what they wanted. The Echo of Duriel is perhaps the most interesting of the five, as Duriel has a chance to drop the ultimate, super-rare, uber Uniques that were previously almost impossible to acquire. To compensate, players will need to kill the four other endgame bosses each time they want to face Duriel.\nBlizzard\u2019s designers didn\u2019t build these bosses to be as tough as the ultimate Uber Lilith fight. However, these bosses will (hopefully) prove a challenge to most players while still giving them a targeted way to farm some must-have items. The Echo of Duriel (who is level 100) will be the most difficult of the new bosses, but the reward will obviously be worth the struggle, considering he\u2019s the only way for players to farm Uber Uniques in Diablo 4. For players who have more in-game gold than time, Blizzard also confirmed in our interview that players will be able to trade with one another to get the items needed to summon Duriel and the other bosses.\nWhile these bosses are a form of milestone activity for players, Nightmare Dungeons will still exist as places to both farm for better items and push builds to their limit. However, the dungeons are becoming much simpler and less grindy. The design team has reworked several Nightmare Dungeon affixes to make them less obnoxious, and Nightmare Sigils now teleport players directly into the dungeon instead of to the door.\nTeleporting to Nightmare Dungeons is one thing, but players will still need to ride their horses around the world if they want to reach events like Helltides and the new seasonal activity, Blood Harvest. Thankfully, mounts have also been improved in season 2. Horses are now faster, and their dashes will allow them to break through barricades in the roads. Shely told us that the mounts should be more intelligent as well, and they won\u2019t get stuck on objects in the world as easily as before.\nTwo of the other biggest pain points \u2014 gems and Renown \u2014 are also getting addressed in this season.\nThe grind to accrue Renown \u2014 the resource players get for completing activities in each area \u2014 is no longer something players will need to partake in every season. Much like the Altars of Lilith change in season 1, players who\u2019ve fully unlocked their Renown track with one character will never have to do it again.\nPreviously, players would have to max out their Renown \u2014 which all but required doing nearly every dungeon and most side quests in the game \u2014 every season in order to get all available Skill and Paragon Points. Not only is that not the case anymore, but (unlike with the Altars of Lilith carryover) you won\u2019t need to first log into a character that\u2019s completed the Renown track in order to propagate that data to the rest of your account. Piepiora told us that all of that data migration should happen without that extra step in season 2.\nThis is yet another massive 180 on the Renown system from Blizzard in barely five months\u2019 time. When we asked about the massive shift, Piepiora told us that players simply weren\u2019t having fun redoing the grind every season, hence the move here (as with the Altars last season) to alleviate the pressure on players to only play \u201cefficiently.\u201d\nAs for gems, these items will no longer take up bag space, as they\u2019re now considered crafting materials. This change comes alongside a massive upgrade to the Stash itself. Stashes now appear in more locations \u2014 including all minor towns with a Waypoint in them \u2014 and players can search their Stashes for specific items and affixes.\nThese are just a handful of the major changes coming to Diablo 4 with Season of Blood. Shely and Piepiora told us that the focus on quality-of-life upgrades was largely due to season 2 being the first season where they and the rest of the Diablo 4 team could really listen to feedback. Because of how close Season of the Malignant launched after the release of Diablo 4 (just over a month), that season\u2019s content was largely finished before players had really gotten to dive into the action-RPG. However, with season 2, Blizzard has been able to react more to player feedback and finally create some sweeping, specific changes that players have been requesting.\nAll of these changes, as well as the content for Season of Blood, will come to the game on Oct. 17, just a few weeks before fans are expecting Blizzard to announce Diablo 4\u2019s first expansion at BlizzCon 2023.\n\nThis article, authored by Ryan Gilliam, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-04 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":533}

Yet that was all Argentina would get, and while it was enough for a 1-0 victory, they could have had many, many more.\nLionel Messi came off the bench shortly after halftime, but even he was powerless to change the narrative, hitting the post twice including once directly off a corner.\nLautaro Martinez, Rodrigo de Paul, and Nico Gonzalez were all very active in the final third and had multiple chances, but none were able to find the all-important second goal to kill off the match. Yet in the end, Emiliano Martinez had himself another clean sheet as Paraguay failed to produce more than a single quality attacking chance.\nThe shutout gave Dibu an Argentine national team record, passing 609 minutes without conceding a goal, as Argentina have not been breached since Kylian Mbappe's dramatic 118th minute equalizer in the 2022 World Cup final. Additionally, Lionel Scaloni has still never been beaten in World Cup qualifying as Argentina head coach.\nThe Sporting News followed the Argentina vs. Paraguay match live, providing score updates, commentary and highlights as they happened.\nMORE: Where to watch Argentina vs. Paraguay in World Cup qualifying\nArgentina vs Paraguay final score\nScore Goal scorers Argentina 1 Otamendi (4') Paraguay 0 \u2014\nKickoff: 8 p.m. local (7 p.m. ET \/ 4 p.m. PT)\nLocation: Estadio Monumental (Buenos Aires, Argentina)\nReferee: Raphael Claus (BRA)\nStarting lineups:\nArgentina (4-3-3, right to left): 23.

Argentina have a very dangerous free-kick as Lionel Messi baits Gustavo Gomez into a foul just atop the penalty area in a central location. Gomez does well to dispossess Messi, but the Argentine is first back on the loose ball, expertly shielding the ball with his body, and Gomez obliges by barging in from behind.\nWith the set-piece, Messi hits the woodwork! Carlos Coronel is helpless to do anything but watch, rooted to the spot, and he sees it sail by him and strike the outside of the left post!\nGio Lo Celso comes on for Argentina to replace Rodrigo de Paul, who had a very good match.\n89th min: As this game sputters towards a conclusion, Emiliano Martinez has set a new national team record for a shutout streak, crossing 609 minutes of play without conceding a goal. It's an impressive mark nonetheless, but in fairness, he's had almost nothing to do tonight, making just one (admittedly impressive) save.\nArgentina have not conceded a single goal since the 2022 World Cup final.

He's in acres of space atop the penalty area shaded just right of the middle, and cutting onto his left, he rifles a shot just high! He should be hitting the target from there with so much space to shoot.\nThat's the first real chance on goal from open play for either team in some time. The game has been mucked up a bit by the substitutions on both sides.\n77th min: Chance, Argentina! LIONEL MESSI HITS THE POST DIRECTLY FROM A CORNER!

At first it seems like a cramp as a teammate stretches out his leg, but he continues to grimace in pain, and after the medical staff tends to the Paraguay defender for a bit, they signal to the bench that a change is required.\nAlonso is strapped to a stretcher and continues to grimace in lots of pain. On comes Mathias Villasanti, signaling a potential change of formation.\n70th min: Junior Alonso has got to be careful. Already on a yellow card, he fouls Lautaro Martinez hard and gets a talking too from the referee.\nParaguay make their second change of the match, a double swap as Antonio Sanabria and Braian Ojeda come on, replacing Antonio Bareiro and Alvaro Campuzano.\n68th min: Rodrigo de Paul forces a save from Carlos Coronel! It's from an extremely tight angle on the right, almost on top of the end line, so Coronel has his post covered well, but it wins a corner. The set-piece is wasted by being played short.\n63rd min: It has to be said...Argentina have dropped their level since Lionel Messi has come on. That's not to say its explicitly his fault, but the whole team has been sloppy since he entered the pitch. Paraguay have looked a bit more confident pressing the hosts, and it has caused some problems to them in possession.\n57th min: Uh, how has Ramon Sosa got away without a booking here? He barges into Rodrigo de Paul extremely late for no reason, as he arrived well after the ball and threw his body into the Argentine midfielder. The referee has a chat with Sosa, but decides not to book him, somehow.\n53rd min: Chance, Paraguay! The best attacking move of the match for the visitors nearly sees Ramon Sosa score a dramatic equalizer, but Emiliano Martinez makes a fingertips save to see the ball deflect just inches wide! It comes on a Route One move deep for Sosa who brings the ball down well and fires a vicious shot.\nLionel Messi enters for Julian Alvarez, and takes the captain's armband from Nicolas Otamendi with a chuckle, as Otamendi puts it on Messi himself despite Messi telling him not to give it up.\nIt's kind of odd that Lionel Scaloni would turn down the chance to bring Messi on at halftime without burning a substitution window, only to see him enter only eight minutes later, but here we are.\nEL REY A LA CANCHA \ud83d\udd1f\u2705\n\nLionel Messi ingres\u00f3 por Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez a los 52 minutos en Argentina vs. Paraguay.\n\n\u00bfMarcar\u00e1 alg\u00fan gol? pic.twitter.com\/Fj7Dqcsfps \u2014 TNT Sports Argentina (@TNTSportsAR) October 13, 2023\n50th min: Antonio Bareiro picks up a hilarious yellow card after a coming together with Cristiano Romero. Bareiro fouls Romero and gets away with it, and Romero reacts later off the ball by bumping the Paraguay forward, who throws himself dramatically to the turf. It's the reaction which earns the booking, while Romero is lucky to get away with his brainless moment.\nKickoff: They've begun the second half, and while Lionel Messi has not entered the pitch yet, he's warming up on the touchline and likely to come on soon. Alexis Mac Allister is fouled from behind just seconds after the restart.\nRobert Rojas has come on for Paraguay in the first substitution of the match, entering at right-back for Ivan Ramirez.\nHALFTIME: Argentina 1-0 Paraguay\nSomehow, some way, Nicolas Otamendi's fourth-minute goal remains the only successful strike of this game so far. Argentina completely and utterly dominated the first 45 minutes, but have precious little to show for it.\nThe hosts pummeled Carlos Coronel's net, and while the Red Bulls goalkeeper has made a few saves, it's mostly been Argentina's wastefulness that has seen them fail to follow up their early opener. Rodrigo de Paul hit the post, Alexis Mac Allister probably should have had a penalty, and Nico Gonzalez has missed a few great chances from the left.\nOverall, Lionel Scaloni will be pleased with his side's performance, but the match hangs in the balance on the scoresheet. In reality, thought, Paraguay need vast improvement if they are to snatch a result after being meticulously carved to pieces.\n1 - Argentina \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 super\u00f3 a Paraguay \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddfe en el primer tiempo en posesi\u00f3n (74% a 26%), remates totales (10 a 2), remates al arco (4 a 0), toques en \u00e1rea rival (17 a 1) y pases acertados (354 a 101).

The hosts break down the right, and Enzo Fernandez has acres of space to shoot at the top of the penalty area, but instead squares it left to Nico Gonzalez. The Argentina winger also has tons of room to shoot, but he's at a tight angle, and Carlos Coronel's positioning leaves him with a very small window to aim for.\nNeeding a precise finish, Gonzalez comes up empty, dragging it wide across the face of goal. It's not far off, but it's missing the required precision! How have Argentina not scored a second????\n42nd min: Chance, Argentina! RODRIGO DE PAUL HITS THE POST! It's SO close from the Argentine midfielder, who's been very active in the final third! After cutting onto his left, he brings it back onto his right and unleashes a curler which dances past a diving Carlos Coronel and strikes the inside of the post!\nThe ball agonizingly careens along the face of goal and skitters away. Just another half-inch more towards the frame and it would have deflected in instead of out!\n41st min: Paraguay are getting extremely frustrated with their lack of attacking possession. They get into the final third for the first time in ages, but with no support, Antonio Bareiro blasts a hopeless effort from a long way out, the shot blocked by his defender who's all over the lone Paraguay striker like white on rice.\n38th min: Chance, Argentina! A deep delivery from way out on the right touchline meets the head of a leaping Nico Gonzalez at the far post, but it's saved well by Carlos Coronel! The header was from a very tight angle, but the Red Bulls goalkeeper still had work to do as he reacted quickly to stick out his left foot and make the reflex stop.\n36th min: Chance, Argentina! The referee very dramatically waves away a penalty shout from Alexis Mac Allister! A corner is cleared to the Liverpool midfielder at the top of the penalty area, and he does brilliantly to dribble through multiple defenders. Before he can get a shot off, he's bumped to the ground, and replay shows he has a clear grievance with the no-call! VAR does not intervene.\nALEXIS MAC ALLISTER, STOP THAT.pic.twitter.com\/wlShqa6mqR \u2014 Roy Nemer (@RoyNemer) October 12, 2023\n34th min: Alvaro Campuzano is whistled for a foul after hip checking Nicolas Tagliafico to the ground, handing Argentina a dangerous free-kick just inside the attacking third. The call by the official sends both Campuzano and Paraguay manager Daniel Garnero into a frenzy, as neither agree with the decision, but it's the right call for overly aggressive body positioning.\nThe chance is wasted, however, as it is easily cleared and Argentina must reset.\n30th min: Chance, Argentina! Lautaro Martinez has a vicious shot agonizingly deflected wide! He's played in on a cutback from Julian Alvarez down the right, and while the Inter striker has a quality hit from the penalty spot, it just clips a defender and loops inches over the crossbar! That's unlucky!\nArgentina are absolutely pummeling the Paraguay back line with silky move after silky move, and the visitors are barely surviving. It's been an onslaught through the first half-hour, especially across the last 10 minutes or so. The one-touch passing through midfield has been essentially unplayable, and on the rare occasion they do lose the ball, they've won it right back within five seconds.\nArgentina are playing champagne football. \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 pic.twitter.com\/y2u5IqqUPy \u2014 Roy Nemer (@RoyNemer) October 12, 2023\n25th min: Julian Alvarez has a shot saved from a very tight angle by Carlos Coronel, conceding a corner. The chance was threaded in beautifully by his strike partner Lautaro Martinez. The set-piece is looped well off target by the head of Cristian Romero.\n21st min: The first yellow card of the game is shown to Junior Alonso who comes flying into a challenge with Alexis Mac Allister and catches him high on the ankle. A very bad tackle \u2014 not quite worthy of a red, but it's not far off either.\n16th min: Ouch, Lautaro Martinez tries to latch onto a wonderful vertical flick from Enzo Fernandez up the gut, but he's just a split-second too late, and he goes sliding into the ribs of Paraguay goalkeeper Carlos Coronel. That looked painful for the Red Bulls goalie, but he's ok to continue.\nIt's a bit surprising that Lautaro got away with no booking from that really dangerous decision.\n13th min: Chance, Argentina! Oh no, it's a terribly bad miss from Nico Gonzalez. The Argentine winger breaks down the left, and with the Paraguay defense lagging behind, he's got plenty of room to shoot across the face of goal from a somewhat tight angle.\nThe \"shot\" is so bad it's hard to tell if he was trying to put it on frame or square it for a teammate at the back post, but it's a tragic attempt either way, as there was nobody anywhere close at the far stick to meet it.\n9th min: Paraguay get their first attacking move playing long to the striker, but after a few nervy moments the Argentina defense recovers and gets back on the ball.\n4th min: GOAL! ARGENTINA! IT'S A GOLAZO FROM THE CAPTAIN NICOLAS OTAMENDI!\nThe first corner of the match goes to Argentina, and as Rodrigo de Paul floats it deep and over the pack, it comes to the Argentina defender who produces an absolutely STUNNING whipped volley, and strikes the ball cleanly by chopping his leg down on the bouncing ball, blasting it through the trees and into the back of the net!\n#ARG 1-0 #PAR | 03\u2019 PT | \u00a1GRITALO NICO!

Messi had missed the previous four matches but returned to the field for the final 30 minutes. He was powerless to turn the tide of the game, after Inter Miami had missed so many gilt-edged chances in the first half.\nHad Inter Miami been still in the playoff hunt, with a potential postseason run on the horizon, Argentina might have played it a bit safer with Messi in this international window. Yet now that his long offseason break is confirmed, Messi may be more aggressive with his minutes here knowing that, after Inter Miami's final two meaningless regular-season matches, he will only have international breaks to keep him sharp until February.\nAccording to a report earlier today, Messi will not start tonight, but is likely to play much or all of the second half, while Lautaro Martinez and Julian Alvarez both start a national team match for the first time.

Messi missed the last match against Bolivia, and missed four Inter Miami games after, but he returned for a half-hour of action in their final fixture before the international break. However, he doesn't start, but is reportedly fit enough to come off the bench for most or all of the second half.\nNicolas Tagliafico started both matches in September, and while Marcos Acuna is back with the team following an injury, the former retains his starting spot.

Players need game time to build their bodies to the point where they can play full 90-minute matches, especially when they are contesting multiple games a week.\nInter Miami's preseason will be watched with extra observation as Messi draws considerable attention wherever he goes, home or abroad. The Argentina star had looked like being part of a tour of China, although that's no longer the case, while the prospect of facing a familiar side from home is a tantalising one.\nThe Sporting News has compiled all the known preseason matches either confirmed or reported prior to the start of Inter Miami's 2024 season.\nMORE: Read all the details regarding Inter Miami vs Al Nassr featuring Messi vs Ronaldo\nInter Miami friendly matches for 2024 preseason\nBelow are all the known fixtures that have either been confirmed by the club directly or widely reported by media.\nIt was anticipated that Inter Miami would embark on a two-match tour of China, but that has now been cancelled, with the trip proving too difficult logistically to arrange. It was replaced by a friendly against fellow MLS side NYCFC to honor Lionel Messi's Ballon d'Or.\nThe biggest confirmed match is the meeting between Messi and rival Cristiano Ronaldo as Inter Miami announced a pair of fixtures in Saudi Arabia, including against Ronaldo's Al Nassr on February 1.\nMORE: When does Inter Miami's 2024 season begin?

Three days prior, Inter Miami will also meet fellow Saudi club Al Hilal.\nMessi and Ronaldo have squared off 35 times across their careers, with Messi winning 16 times to Ronaldo's 10, plus nine draws.

The match will be played on February 4 at Hong Kong Stadium, which seats approximately 40,000 fans, while the club will hold an open training session the day prior. Tickets go on sale December 15 on ticket exchange site Klook.\nWhile the match is the only one in Asia confirmed as of yet, Inter Miami's reference of the trip as a \"tour of Asia\" suggests more matches could be announced in due time. It's notable that Inter Miami will indeed travel to Asia after their attempts to play matches in China back in November fell through.\n\"We're very excited to be visiting Hong Kong and indeed Asia for the very first time,\" explained Jorge Mas, Inter Miami CF Managing Owner. \"From the very beginning we set out to be a global club at Inter Miami. This is a wonderful opportunity to do just that; we hope to enthuse and inspire new Inter Miami fans in Hong Kong and across Asia who share our passion for f\u00fatbol.\"\n\u201cHong Kong is a beautiful city with a great sports scene,\u201d added Inter Miami CF Co-Owner, David Beckham. \u201cThroughout my career, I have spent a lot of time in Asia - I am so pleased to have the opportunity to bring Inter Miami to play our first international tour match in this fantastic city.\u201d\nVissel Kobe to face Inter Miami in Tokyo\nFollowing the match with Hong Kong, Inter Miami will head to Tokyo to take on J1 League champions Vissel Kobe.\nThe game will take place at the Japan National Stadium and feature a very special guest: Andres Iniesta.\nSpain's World Cup-winning midfielder spent five years with Vissel Kobe after spending his entire club career until that point with Barcelona, where he played alongside Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba during an era of astonishing success in Catalonia.\n\"Vissel Kobe is a powerhouse club in Asia coming off of a historic season after winning the J1 League, so we're thrilled about this opportunity to sharpen our team in a match like this one.

Not only are both men from the city of Rosario, where Newell's are based, but Messi developed at the club's youth academy and Martino played more than 400 senior games for the club before becoming head coach in 2012.\n\"I am delighted to welcome my beloved Newell's to our home here in Miami. It will be a special match due to everything Newell's Old Boys means to me,\" said the Inter Miami coach. \"It will also be a good opportunity to prepare for what will surely be an exciting season.\"\nMessi signed for Barcelona after spending six years as a youth player at Newell's, during which time he reportedly scored 234 goals.\nWill Inter Miami face River Plate in Dallas?\nIn late November, it was reported that Inter Miami have arranged to contest a friendly against Argentine giants River Plate in Dallas, Texas in late January.\nAccording to Argentine journalist German Balcarce of River Plate publication RMG, the match will take place on January 20 and will be played at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys. However, with the El Salvador friendly, which is confirmed by the club, happening literally the day before in El Salvador, it would be impossible for Inter Miami to play this match as reported unless they split the squad.\nThe match would supposedly be the second leg of a two-part trip for River Plate, who will also meet Liga MX club Deportivo Guadalajara (formerly Chivas) on January 17 at the same venue. This will be updated with any additional information on whether this match will be moved to another day or nixed entirely.\nInter Miami play NYCFC in Noche d'Or to replace China trip\nWith the club's elimination from 2023 MLS playoff contention, Lionel Messi is facing nearly a full month off from competitive fixtures before he takes the field for Argentina against Uruguay and Brazil in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.\nLikely with the sole intent of keeping Messi fit in that time off, and the added bonus of raking in significant cash, Inter Miami scheduled a two-match tour of China in early November after their regular season concluded.\nThey were expected to visit two Chinese Super League sides, starting with a match against Qingdao Hainiu on November 5, followed by a game against Chengdu Rongcheng three days later However, it was reported on October 30 the planned tour was off.

{"title":"The inside story of Dave Clark's tumultuous last days at Flexport","context":"## The inside story of Dave Clark's tumultuous last days at Flexport\n\nIn this article SHOP-CA\nUPS\nFDX\nAMZN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nDave Clark (L) and Ryan Petersen (R) Getty Images\nOn Sept. 13, Flexport founder Ryan Petersen took the stage at North America's premier supply chain conference in Phoenix. It was exactly a week after he'd forced out his hand-picked successor as CEO, ex-Amazon executive Dave Clark, so Petersen could once again run the show. Sitting in the first few rows of attendees was Clark, the man he'd ousted just a year into the job. Petersen was surprised that he showed up, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Days earlier, Petersen had excoriated Clark, alleging he'd secretly expanded the company's headcount and taken on unnecessary leases without Petersen or the board's knowledge. On X, formerly known as Twitter, Petersen wrote, \"Strategic Plan, Day 1: Make better decisions!\" With Clark sitting a few feet away, Petersen struck a different tone. \"I think we're going to look back and go, 'Wow I'd probably do that all over again because of the progress that we've made,'\" Petersen said, in an interview on stage. Doing it over again would seem to suggest hiring Clark wasn't a bad decision. Petersen went even further, personally commending Clark for orchestrating the $1.3 billion purchase of Deliverr from Shopify , picking up supply chain technology for last-mile deliveries. That deal was announced in May. \"I'm very, very lucky because I wouldn't have had the courage to go and do that acquisition, but I give all the credit in the world to Dave Clark,\" Petersen said. \"There's no one probably in the world who would be better at running that last-mile e-com fulfillment network. Personally, I don't have any experience and I would've been pretty intimidated to try and go pull that off.\" The mixed messaging from the 43-year-old Flexport founder underscores the dysfunction surrounding the sudden firing of Clark, who previously spent 23 years at Amazon and built its mammoth logistics network on the way to becoming one of Jeff Bezos' top deputies. It's also indicative of a bigger challenge facing Flexport, whose software is designed to simplify the process of transporting goods. The company was valued at $8 billion by private investors in early 2022, just as the economy was turning and the 10-year tech bull market was coming to an end. As a high-valued company backed by powerful VCs, Flexport has been trying to simultaneously operate in Silicon Valley startup growth mode while also restraining expenses to reflect the new economic realities and to cope with supply chain bottlenecks. This account is based on conversations with people close to Clark and Petersen. They requested anonymity to discuss confidential interactions. Their perspectives have been corroborated by internal documents and communications reviewed by CNBC. Petersen has publicly said Clark overspent, overhired and overpromised, something his allies echoed to CNBC. He burned through cash and kept Petersen in the dark about key financials and an ambitious expansion into providing end-to-end supply chain tools for small and medium-sized businesses. People close to Petersen pointed to a number of previously unreported incidents that eroded his confidence in Clark. But documents viewed by CNBC and sources close to Clark undermine those claims. They show that Clark, who arrived when the company was struggling to bill customers and track containers, worked closely with the board and Petersen to implement decisions that Flexport now suggests were ill-advised. Evidence to support Flexport's claims of financial mismanagement is lacking, raising questions about whether that narrative was put forward to justify Clark's exit. A Flexport spokesperson rejected that characterization. \"Ryan Petersen returned as CEO in order to restore Flexport's culture of customer engagement, and drive the growth and cost discipline required to return the company to profitability,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\nGet IPO ready\nClark arrived last year as the perfect hire for a tech startup trying to disrupt the age-old logistics industry. He'd built Amazon's logistics unit into a juggernaut that rivaled carriers like UPS and FedEx .\nRyan Petersen, chief executive officer of Flexport, participates in a panel discussion during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nSince 2021, Petersen had been seeking a successor for Flexport's then-operating chief, Sanne Manders, in part to address what several ex-employees described as lingering issues with the company's troubled billing processes. Fixing that was Clark's job. Petersen and Clark worked together as co-CEOs for the first six months. In March, Petersen transitioned to executive chairman. The co-CEO arrangement would free Petersen up to do what he loved \u2013 \"getting beers with customers,\" in the words of two former Flexport employees. Clark, a self-described \"builder at heart,\" was at the wheel. Among Clark's goals was to help Petersen prepare Flexport for an IPO, something the company had discussed doing within a two- to three-year window, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents viewed by CNBC. \"There's a perfect complement of skill sets,\" Petersen told Forbes in June 2022. \"Mine are much more creative, zero-to-one founder time, and Dave is the supreme executor and a legend in the supply chain world.\" Buying Deliverr was meant to be the first step in turning Flexport into a more full-scale logistics service for its customers. Shopify had acquired Deliverr in May 2022 for $2.1 billion. But the e-commerce software company was getting hammered by Wall Street as its Covid pandemic pop faded. By January 2023, CEO Tobias Lutke knew he needed to get rid of Deliverr. Around that time, Lutke first approached Petersen to float the possibility of a deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Petersen told Clark he should engage with Shopify's team, according to a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations. Initial talks fell apart, but resumed when Flexport executives learned that Shopify was about to execute deep cost cuts and was eager to sell Deliverr. Clark and Petersen flew to Miami to meet with Shopify's leadership. As a transaction was nearing, Clark, who had a reputation as a deft negotiator, got Shopify, which was already an investor in Flexport, to sweeten it with $40 million in cash and the framework for a $260 million convertible note that could help Flexport on its path to an IPO, according to an internal document analyzing the deal. The sale would be announced alongside Shopify's first-quarter earnings report on May 4. \"We did not change the terms of a deal or rush it just to have it line up with an earnings call,\" Shopify said in a statement. With Flexport, \"we are tightly mission-aligned to ensure the success of our merchants, which is why we chose to deepen our partnership with them earlier this year.\" The night before the announcement, Petersen appeared at a \"Tech Talk\" at Flexport's Bellevue, Washington, office to pitch the \"Flexport vision\" to hundreds of people. An attendee asked Petersen whether Flexport would ever get into last-mile logistics. Petersen paused, glanced at his watch, and said to keep an eye on the morning news, according to a Flexport employee who witnessed the exchange and by a person who was told independently. The comment alarmed Clark and Flexport executives, who were concerned that Petersen had disclosed material nonpublic information about a publicly traded company, according to people familiar with the matter. Petersen didn't respond to calls or messages from CNBC, and the company declined to make him available for an interview. A Flexport spokesperson didn't respond to CNBC's question about whether Petersen was aware of concerns about his statement at the event.\nThe 'whistleblower'\nClark's first quarterly board meeting as sole CEO was June 1. His second was Aug. 31, days before he was forced out. The board was made up largely of investors who were betting on the founder. It included Founders Fund's Trae Stephens, who had helped start defense-tech firm Anduril Industries, and Michael Ronen, who left SoftBank in 2020. Andreessen Horowitz was represented by Bob Swan, an operating partner at the firm and former CEO of Intel .\nBob Swan, then-interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Intel Corp., reacts during the inauguration of the company's research and development facility in Bengaluru, India, on November 15, 2018. Samyukta Lakshmi | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nFor much of the summer, Clark had pushed then-CFO Kenny Wagers and his financial planning and analysis team to realign Flexport's year-end and 18-month forecasts, according to a person close to the situation. The reasons were obvious. At the beginning of 2022, it cost around $14,500 to move a single container across the Pacific. By late 2022, prices of ocean freight from Asia to the U.S. West Coast were down 90% from a year earlier, due largely to weakening global demand. Because Flexport makes money by charging fees for the transportation of goods, the company's business was getting hammered. But Wagers and Stuart Leung, a Flexport finance executive and a close Petersen ally, were reluctant to pare back forecasts, frustrating Clark, who felt those projections were overly optimistic. Wagers and Leung did not respond to CNBC's interview requests. Clark ultimately prevailed, but the revised forecasts distressed Petersen. Clark, Petersen and Wagers met in Texas in mid-August to fine-tune the forecasts. A source close to Petersen told CNBC that the meeting went poorly for Clark because a so-called whistleblower \u2014 identified as a senior finance executive \u2014 stepped forward shortly before it began and told Petersen that the numbers being presented were \"not real.\" The source referred to the senior finance executive as a whistleblower because of the information he disclosed to Petersen about Clark. Documents seen by CNBC and conversations with people with direct knowledge of the board meeting make it clear that there were no substantiated whistleblower actions or allegations of financial impropriety. Flexport's spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"There was no whistleblower nor was there any financial misconduct. Any allegations to the contrary are completely false.\" On Sept. 15, shortly after CNBC spoke with the Petersen source, legal counsel for Clark sent a cease-and-desist letter to Flexport. The letter, viewed by CNBC, instructed the company to preserve and retain all communications involving Clark's departure. The letter disputes the existence of a whistleblower and lists specific allegations as false and defamatory, including Petersen's claims that Clark was an unfit CEO because he overextended the company's lease obligations. Five hours after the letter was sent, the source close to Petersen contacted CNBC and asked to retract their statements and all details related to Clark's firing or about the so-called whistleblower. CNBC declined to retract his statements. Petersen has since deleted several of his posts criticizing Clark.\nDave Clark, Amazon's former senior vice president of worldwide operations. Lindsey Wasson | Reuters\nThe letter cited two documents that had been presented to the board. Both were viewed by CNBC. The first was a pre-acquisition financial analysis of the Deliverr deal, and the second was a review of Flexport's first-quarter numbers. The Deliverr analysis was presented by the co-CEOs to the board for their approval and was shaped by multiple prior board meetings. Clark's camp suggested that other factors may have led to the abrupt firing. For example, politics. Days after Clark was ousted, Petersen sent him a message \u2014 seen by CNBC \u2014 blasting one of his key female executives for wasting her days at the company on \"far left-wing political activism.\" The executive is a registered Republican. Stephens, the Founders Fund partner, also shared his contempt for that executive weeks before Clark's departure, a person familiar with the board told CNBC. Stephens did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Petersen is also a venture partner at Founders Fund, the firm started by Peter Thiel, who was a prominent supporter of President Trump's 2016 campaign and more recently bankrolled Senate candidates in Ohio and Arizona. Many of Thiel's closest confidantes at Founders Fund and elsewhere in the venture industry are outspoken conservatives. Petersen's sole public political contribution in 2023 was to a Democratic political action committee associated with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. He doesn't talk much about politics on social media or in interviews. Clark has donated to candidates on both sides of the aisle. Upon his departure, The Wall Street Journal reported that he was considering running for governor of Texas, but two people familiar with his thinking say it's not happening anytime soon. Flexport told CNBC that an employee's politics are not relevant in personnel decisions. \"Ryan Petersen does not care at all about anyone's political or personal affiliations. That is their business,\" the spokesperson said. \"It is inappropriate for any employee to spend an excessive amount of time during work hours on activities unrelated to their role.\" A person familiar with the female executive said her noncorporate endeavors were largely related to charitable organizations. Clark has largely remained silent since he was forced to resign on Sept. 5, though in private he's expressed frustration at how his former team was being treated by Flexport, according to people close to him. Many of his allies at Amazon who joined him at Flexport were summarily fired by Petersen shortly after his departure. On Sept. 13, Flexport's chief legal counsel, Chris Ferro, contacted Clark. Ferro told him that his resignation a week prior had not been accepted, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Instead, Ferro told Clark that Flexport's board met the day after Clark resigned and voted to fire him for cause, the person familiar said. Ferro said the board minutes didn't yet reflect why Clark had been fired, the person said. Ferro allegedly told Clark that Flexport would be willing to give him a block of 2 million shares \u2014 worth millions of dollars \u2014 if he signed a separation agreement that included nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses. Clark declined, the person said. Shortly after Flexport reached out with the offer, Clark took the stage at the same supply chain conference in Phoenix that Petersen spoke at earlier in the day. He didn't hold back. \"The only thing I really regret from the past year was I sort of picked the wrong founder,\" Clark said. \"Basically, it was a place of extending my reputational halo to a group that, in my opinion, didn't deserve it. Largely, because about half the team was let go last week on Friday, the most brutal nonseverance packages I've ever seen in my life. It was about as disrespectful a way as humanly possible.\"\nAmazon showdown\nOn top of the public relations fallout from the Clark saga and any legal wrangling that may follow, Flexport faces staffing turnover and a growing threat from Clark's former employer. Flexport recently ousted Wagers as CFO and lost its human resources chief. More layoffs are expected soon, sources said, after the company cut 20% of its staff in January. On Sept. 12, almost a week after Clark was fired, Flexport executives convened in Seattle to launch an end-to-end supply chain service that would allow sellers to move their products from factories to customers' doorsteps through integrations with major online marketplaces. The project was spearheaded by Parisa Sadrzadeh, an executive vice president at Flexport who Clark had poached from Amazon's logistics unit. Earlier in the day, and just up the street from Flexport's event, Amazon had unveiled a strikingly similar service in front of approximately 2,200 attendees at its annual Accelerate seller conference. Flexport had planned to have a booth onsite but was told it couldn't be an exhibitor, which some staffers suspected was due to the competing supply chain products, according to a person familiar with the matter. Flexport discussed securing exhibit space at Accelerate months earlier but didn't meet all the requirements to participate, and its launch wasn't mentioned in those conversations, Amazon said. Flexport's event was underwhelming. In a conference room, about 50 people looked on as Sadrzadeh debuted Flexport's service and then introduced Petersen, who spoke for roughly 20 minutes, according to Burak Yolga, co-founder of a digital freight forwarding company who was in attendance. \"Flexport announced pretty much the same thing that Amazon announced,\" Yolga said in an interview. He said he left after about a half-hour. The company paid rapper Nelly $150,000 to perform at the event. But in the days leading up to the launch, Petersen opted to squash the performance because the optics were bad after his post about rescinding job offers, a person familiar with the matter said. Despite canceling the event, Flexport still paid the artist.

Subscribe for free.\nWelcome back to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.\nIt was an absolutely wild week on the robotaxi front, and more specifically for GM\u2019s self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.\nThe week started off with the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspending Cruise\u2019s driverless and deployment permits (with the California Public Utilities Commission following shortly after), effectively ending the company\u2019s robotaxi operations in San Francisco just months after receiving the last necessary permit to commercialize its operations.\nTwo days later, Cruise decided to pause driverless operations in every market it had started to charge for its robotaxi service, including Austin, Houston and Phoenix.\nThat decision was surprising to me based on how sources had described an all-hands meeting earlier in the week that was led by co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt. In that meeting, which came the day after the DMV suspended Cruise\u2019s permit, Vogt and other leaders told staff the company had not paused operations elsewhere besides California and gave no indication that the company was planning to. Instead, Vogt told employees the company was re-evaluating how it discloses information to regulators to ensure it is clearly communicated, according to an account from sources who heard the call.\nCruise had even quietly launched driverless operations in Miami (just a few vehicles), a move that suggested the company was moving ahead despite its significant problems in California.\nWhat changed? Perhaps Cruise execs were pressured by GM or they looked around and realized that they were losing support from other states. Either way, Cruise said it\u2019s now going to examine \u201cprocesses, systems, and tools and reflect on how we can better operate in a way that will earn public trust.\u201d\nThat might be a hefty challenge, especially in California. As the Cruise drama unfolded, opposition against robotaxis grew in cities like Los Angeles. And two of the biggest groups to oppose robotaxi expansion in California are now formally working together.\nWant to reach out with a tip, comment or complaint?

The tiny car in question? Project X, a concept built by the Foxconn-led Mobility in Harmony Consortium (MIH). The cute little EV is a three-seater; the spot in the backseat where you\u2019d normally seat a fourth person is taken up by two Gogoro battery pack slots.\nAt the event, MIH said it aims to sell 100,000 of the minicars per year in India, Thailand and Japan starting in 2025. The company will initially target fleet operators and ride-hailing services rather than individual customers. MIH says Project X supports autonomous driving Levels 2 to 4 depending on the user\u2019s needs. The price isn\u2019t yet fixed, but should top around $20,000.\nIt\u2019s not clear if Gogoro\u2019s swappable batteries will be used to power the vehicles going forward. After all, that would require Gogoro to set up a swapping network in those regions. But if so, it would signal a new revenue stream for the company, which has been struggling to reach profitability amid softening demand and large investments into international expansion.\n\u2014 Rebecca Bellan\nDeal of the week\nWell this is a fun one.\nFlexport is in talks to acquire the technology of Convoy, the once buzzy digital freight startup that abruptly shuttered after failing to find a buyer. This possible deal, which was reported by WSJ, didn\u2019t have any other details, but it still made me raise an eyebrow.\nLest you forget, Flexport founder Ryan Petersen just took back the CEO title after his hand-picked successor was pushed out. Petersen\u2019s big message has been getting the company\u2019s financial house back in order and has criticized former CEO Dave Clark of overspending, specifically around hiring and expanding too quickly. Petersen has spent the past month cutting costs, including laying off about 20% of its workers, or about 600 people.\nIf Flexport acquires the technology, the company plans to restore Convoy\u2019s trucking services for as many customers and partners as possible, according to WSJ\u2019s source. And folks, that\u2019s going to cost money. Is Petersen\u2019s reign of financial frugality already over?\nOther deals that got my attention \u2026\nFaction, the driverless tech developer, raised an undisclosed amount in a round led by TDK Ventures. Ducera Partners, Trucks Venture Capital and Fifty Years also joined the round.\nOla Electric raised $384.4 million in a funding round, which included about $240 million in debt. Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Temasek led the funding round and Indian government-backed lender State Bank of India bankrolled the debt. The new round values the Bengaluru-headquartered electric vehicle startup at about $5.4 billion\nPony.ai, the Chinese autonomous vehicle startup, scored $100 million from Neom, Saudi Arabia\u2019s futuristic city and development project. As part of the deal, a joint venture will be established to develop, manufacture and deploy autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructure in Neom and key markets in the Middle East North Africa region.\nNeom also announced plans this week to set up a $10 billion joint venture with Danish freight forwarder DSV.\nStellantis made a \u20ac1.5 billion deal ($1.59 billion) to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle maker Zhejiang Leapmotor Technologies, just days after ending manufacturing in the country. The deal includes the formation of Leapmotor International, a 51% to 49% Stellantis-led joint venture that has exclusive rights for the export and sale, as well as manufacturing, of Leapmotor products outside China.\nNotable reads and other tidbits\nAutonomous vehicles\nWaymo driverless vehicles are now available through the Uber app, starting with Phoenix. The launch comes five months since the two companies announced a multi-year agreement for the autonomous vehicle service to be accessed via the Uber app.\nElectric vehicles, batteries & charging\nFord is delaying about $12 billion in planned investments on EVs, including construction of a second battery plant with joint venture partner SK On due to softening demand for higher-priced premium electric vehicles. While EV sales have grown, consumers aren\u2019t willing to pay a premium for an EV over a gas or hybrid vehicle. That price pressure has squeezed profits, and in the case of Ford\u2019s EV business caused losses to grow.\nGeneral Motors and long-time partner Honda have ended plans to build millions of affordable and smaller electric vehicles as the automakers come to terms with high interest rates and battery costs coupled with softening EV demand. Anyone spotting a trend here?\nNikola, the electric and hydrogen-powered heavy truck maker, was awarded $165 million from its founder and former executive chairman, Trevor Milton, in an arbitration proceeding.\nNio has opened its 2,000th Power Swap Station in China, nearing its goal to build 2,300 stations by the end of 2023. The company has expanded on its strategy of swapping out EV batteries, rather than charging them, an infrastructure-intensive process that has the potential to make topping up a battery as quick as filling up a gas tank.\nTesla has the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 again. This time it has received requests for information, including subpoenas from the DOJ related to perks, the advertised range of its EVs and personnel decisions.\nIn-car and mobile tech\nGoogle Maps and Waze stopped live traffic updates in Israel and the Gaza Strip at the request of the Israel Defense Forces. A Google spokesperson said the ability to see live traffic conditions and business information was halted temporarily out of \u201cconsideration for the safety of local communities.\u201d Google did something similar in 2022 amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine because the apps were being used to track military movements.\nXPeng, often called the Chinese challenger to Tesla, has removed high-definition mapping in its XNGP assisted driving feature following its rival\u2019s lead.\nRide-hailing and car-sharing\nRapido, the eight-year-old Indian bike taxi startup, is expanding into the cab market in the South Asian nation, where Uber and its homegrown competitor Ola dominate.\nPeer-to-peer car-sharing marketplace Turo has introduced a buy-now-pay-later option. Now you can reserve a car without immediately paying for it until seven days before a trip. Turo says it built the BNPL option in-house.\nUAW strike\nProgress was made as the United Autoworkers strike wrapped up its sixth week. The UAW struck tentative deals with Ford and Stellantis this past week. Workers still have to ratify the deal, but with UAW president Shawn Fain\u2019s support that outcome is likely.\nHowever, over at GM, it appears that negotiations are moving in the opposite direction. The UAW called for a surprise walkout at GM\u2019s Spring Hill, Tennessee factory, a plant where 4,000 workers assemble engines and three Cadillac models.\n\nThis article, authored by Kirsten Korosec, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":537}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nThis time was supposed to be different. This Ireland team were different\u2026 are different. But, come the end, the result was the same. On quarter-final weekend, for the eighth time in 10 Rugby World Cups, Ireland head home defeated and the wait for a first-ever knockout win goes on.\nYou could feel the desperation around the Stade de France, awash with green thanks to the Irish fans doing their part, as Ireland went through phase after phase after phase after phase hunting the try that could overturn the 28-24 scoreline staring back at them from the giant screen.\nA move that started well inside their own half, with 77 minutes on the clock, ended 37 phases and five minutes later in heartbreak. Thirty-seven gruelling phases of Bundee Aki grinding out extra yards with each punishing carry, Tadhg Beirne left at a literal standstill through tiredness and Johnny Sexton \u2013 for the final time ahead of retirement \u2013 running the famous wraparound upon which he\u2019s built maybe the greatest Ireland career of all-time. But it ended, almost inevitably, with a turnover deep in the New Zealand 22, the ball being kicked to touch and the men in green sinking to the floor bereft.\nThis is the greatest Ireland team of all time, they may still even be the best team in the world but on this day, the quarter-final curse, not to mention an inspired All Blacks side, ruled once more.\nThis defeat will hurt more than any other. Truthfully, since 1991 when Michael Lynagh\u2019s late try handed Australia victory, Ireland hadn\u2019t come close to ending their last-eight hoodoo. Never mind winning one, they haven\u2019t led a World Cup quarter-final since the first half of the 1995 defeat to France, a mammoth 10,353 days ago.\nBut here they had a legitimate chance to reverse the curse. Multiple times they got within a point of the All Blacks, only for their opponents to agonisingly pull away once more. And then there were those 37 phases\u2026 the most painful finish in Irish rugby history.\nIreland were left bereft after an agonising defeat (PA Wire)\nInstead of being feted as the heroes to finally overcome that insurmountable obstacle, the Ireland players will still have to answer endless questions about the heavy burden of previous knockout failures and fans will endure at least four more years of choking jokes at their expense.\nAs for the All Blacks, they looked lost at times during this World Cup cycle and it\u2019s still faintly remarkable that head coach Ian Foster survived last summer as the home defeats to Ireland, South Africa and Argentina piled up.\nYet somehow, he hung on and turned things round. He has the unwanted title of being the first New Zealand coach to lose a World Cup pool match but now a semi-final awaits next Friday evening against an Argentina side that, frankly, are a tier below them. Forget the hand-wringing ahead of the tournament, the All Blacks are one very small step away from another World Cup final.\nFoster will leave his role after the World Cup, to be replaced by all-conquering Crusaders boss Scott Robertson, but he can still exit with the greatest prize of all. And frankly, who would bet against the All Blacks now?\nThe opening-night nerves against France seem a long time ago and they ultimately had too much for Ireland in this simply incredible, back-and-forth Test match that may genuinely go down as one of the best of all time.\nAfter early penalties from Richie Mo\u2019unga and Jordie Barrett, they scored a scintillating try through Leicester Fainga\u2019anuku, who was only in the starting XV due to Mark Telea\u2019s breach of team protocol earlier in the week. Beauden Barrett expertly dinked over the top, collected his own chip and when the ball was spread wide, Fainga\u2019anuku and Rieko Ioane neatly combined to send the former over in the corner.\nNew Zealand played some scintillating rugby in victory (AFP via Getty Images)\nThey led 13-0 and though they may not have realised, no team had ever squandered a lead that large in a World Cup quarter-final. Not that they would have expected an easy ride from there.\nThey conceded a penalty straight from the restart as their kick chase was illegally impeded and Sexton duly slotted the three.\nIreland had made something of a statement during the Haka as their fans drowned it out with a rousing rendition of Fields of Athenry and the players formed a figure of eight in memory of ex-international and Munster coach Anthony Foley, who tragically died in 2016, as they stared down their opponents. But the first real in-match statement came on 27 minutes as New Zealand-born Aki \u2013 perhaps the player of the World Cup so far who had made a tournament-high 61 carries, 33 dominant carries and 23 defenders beaten heading into the weekend \u2013 brilliantly jinked inside two defenders, fended off another and powered through a gap to dive over the line.\nYet more All-Black class saw Ardie Savea go over in the corner after quick ball was shipped wide but with scrum-half Aaron Smith in the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on, Ireland narrowed the gap to 18-17 just before the break as another New Zealand-born Irish star, Jamison Gibson-Park, sniped from a lineout maul and somehow stretched out for the try.\nThe All Blacks extended an incredible record of leading at half-time of their quarter-final in every single World Cup but that lead had never felt more fragile.\nThe All Blacks eventually prevailed in Paris (Reuters)\nThe second half followed a similar, rollercoaster pattern as every time Ireland got close, their opponents found a way to stretch the lead. Mo\u2019unga\u2019s sumptuous dummy and sleight of hand from first-phase lineout ball froze two Irish defenders and led to a scything break before he fed speedster Will Jordan to race over the whitewash.\nThat extended the gap to eight points but a penalty try as an Irish driving maul was illegally hauled down closed it to 25-24 with 17 minutes to go and sent Codie Taylor for 10 minutes in the sin-bin.\nYet this All Blacks team suddenly have a resilience about them and brushed off the underdog status they had been given in the build-up to this game as their tireless back row continually disrupted breakdowns and a disciplined defence refused to yield.\nJordie Barrett added a penalty to take the score to 28-24 and that\u2019s how it eventually stayed. While Ireland will rue the 37 phases that ended in heartbreak, they may just go down in New Zealand rugby history. Tired bodies made tackle after tackle and not a single penalty was given away.\nThe delight at the final whistle showed this wasn\u2019t just any quarter-final victory and while Ireland ponder just what they have to do to finally win a World Cup knockout match, the All Blacks can dream of lifting the Webb Ellis Cup for a fourth time. The pain and ecstasy of sport writ large.\n\nThis article, authored by Luke Baker, was published by The Independent - Sports on 2023-10-14 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":538}
{"title":"CEO David Baszucki\u2019s mission to make Roblox a billion-player platform","context":"## CEO David Baszucki\u2019s mission to make Roblox a billion-player platform\n\nThe Code Conference wrapped up a few days back, and we\u2019re bringing you the last of our interviews from the event. My friend and colleague, Verge deputy editor Alex Heath, sat down to chat with Roblox CEO David Baszucki live onstage.\nEarlier this year, Roblox announced grand plans to build an audience of adults. You probably think of Roblox as a kid thing \u2014 we reported in 2020 that half of all US kids under 16 had played it \u2014 but the last time David and Alex chatted, the company had big plans to change all that, and Alex asked how all of that was going.\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here!\nRoblox is determined to be a platform, even more than a product \u2014 something users can develop games and experiences within. It sounds quite a lot like a metaverse idea, but you\u2019ll hear David say he doesn\u2019t particularly like using that term.\nAnd of course, it was the Code Conference, so David and Alex talked about AI, which was a real theme of our show. David said support for AI is woven all through Roblox\u2019s business, starting with largely invisible functions like efficiency, translation, and safety. But he also sees a lot of opportunity for generative AI to help content creators on the Roblox platform in the not-so-distant future.\nOkay, this is a good one. David Baszucki, CEO of Roblox, live onstage at Code with Alex Heath. Here we go.\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nPlease welcome to the stage the founder and CEO of Roblox, David Baszucki.\nThank you.\nThanks for doing this, Dave. You are fresh off of your annual developer conference, just two weeks ago in San Francisco. I watched the opening keynotes. It seemed like the biggest crowd reaction you got was PlayStation support actually. So I guess my first question is, what took so long?\nIt\u2019s a great question, and thank you for having me here. We\u2019ve put so much focus on mobile quality over the last couple years. It\u2019s our hugest market. We started as a PC product, went to Mac, and the vision of connecting people around the world on every platform has always been the vision. Mobile, we got into really good shape, Xbox in good shape, and then we started rolling out new platforms. As you can imagine, the creator community loves PlayStation because all of their existing creations are going to work there. So for all of these creators that are making a living and making new businesses, it\u2019s just an immediate expansion of their business.\nWas there anything unique about PlayStation from an economics or business partnership perspective that took time, or was it all technical?\nNothing too unique. I think every platform has been very thoughtful in when they start to allow social cross-platform everywhere. I think five or 10 years ago, when we started this notion, Xbox and PlayStation were arguably a little more walled garden-ish, but that vision of connecting and communicating in a 3D space no matter where you are with the best user interface, the best camera, the best motion, whether it\u2019s a phone or a console, I think has really come to bear right now.\nThere\u2019s a lot of product, big-picture stuff I want to get into \u2014 AI, etc. First, though, I want to touch quickly on the layoffs that you guys recently did in your recruiting division.\nYeah.\nI think you had not done layoffs during the pandemic, am I correct?\nWe actually are continuing to hire. We\u2019ve never done layoffs. One thing I think you can see, though, is probably in Q1 of 2023, we were growing our headcount at 50 percent a year, which is very rapid, and that requires a very, very large recruiting team. We\u2019ve committed and we\u2019ve shared the notion that over next year, our bookings are going to grow faster than our headcount, so our headcount growth is probably not going to be 50 percent next year.\nSo that doesn\u2019t say anything bigger about the state of your business?\nNo, absolutely not. I think we\u2019ve done this amazing job of just continuing to grow steadily through all of this over the last two years.\nLet\u2019s talk about aging up the platform. So you have been making this big push to get people above 17 on the platform with exclusive experiences. You\u2019re verifying identity with ID. It\u2019s relatively new. You\u2019re only, I think, a couple months in or so. How\u2019s it going? Actually, I made a new Roblox account from scratch.\nI did it purposefully to see the experience, so this is about two hours ago. And the front page for me after I put my age and everything, was still a lot of games that, frankly, I\u2019m not going to play. Kids games. So it seems like you\u2019re still kind of lagging on that content that would get someone like me on the platform.\nThe fastest-growing segment on the platform is users aged 17 to 24, growing north of 33 percent year on year\nI think that\u2019s a leading indicator. If we roll back the clock four, five, six, seven years when we were much smaller pre-public, that vision of creating an immersive platform that connects people around the world, that allows them to socialize, do things together, we even saw back then this has to be in every country. This has to be in all ages. So we started with the notion that this is going to be a platform for six-year-olds and 60-year-olds. The most recent earnings report, we shared that 17 through 24 is the fastest-growing segment on the platform, growing I think north of 33 percent year on year. So we\u2019ve actually stopped using the term \u201caging up\u201d right now. We have a very substantial over-17 user base. The thing you were experiencing is we have started allowing our creators, when you\u2019re validated with your photo ID and we know for sure you\u2019re 17, to start easing into some of those more mature experiences that you might consider kind of grown-up experience.\nI\u2019ve seen some trailers, like there was one you guys showed at RDC a couple of weeks ago that looked like Grand Theft Auto in Roblox. I mean, the graphics were very impressive. It\u2019s not the blocky kind of thing that you think of with Roblox, and so I can see where it\u2019s going. But I guess right now when you\u2019re telling me that that demographic is growing the fastest, what are they doing on the platform? Because I don\u2019t see the experiences that \u2014\nIt\u2019s surprising the amount of older people that play just a wide range of experiences and come to socialize. I was in Canada hanging out with some third cousin at a family reunion, a 24-year-old guy who works on the railroad as an engineer, and he said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m really excited to meet you because all of the mechanics at CN Railroad [Canadian National Railway] are playing Roblox.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat is going on? That\u2019s too good to be true.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re playing Jailbreak, and we\u2019re playing some of these experiences.\u201d So they are playing these experiences. The level of social, the level of immersion, the level of being together with your friends no matter where they are is somewhat universal. So that\u2019s doing surprisingly well for us.\nThis is kind of a big-picture question, but I\u2019m curious about what you want to be. I think there\u2019s this interesting gap between where Roblox is today, what it\u2019s been historically, and how you talk about the company.\nIn my mind, you could easily be content to just go after the entire gaming market. I mean, it\u2019s bigger than the music and the movie industry combined. But you seem more focused on building a next-generation almost social network. You talk about this as a communications platform. Why go that direction? Is the gaming industry not big enough?\n\u201cOur belief is, this type of technology is bigger than gaming\u201d\nI think that\u2019s a great question. I mean, we\u2019ve shared publicly that our goal would be to get to a billion daily active people on the platform. And I think our vision of what we\u2019re working on goes really almost to the future of communication. It goes to the evolution of the mail system, to the telegraph system, to the phone system, to, as we saw in covid, the video system. We just think inevitably there\u2019s a generation beyond that, which is immersive 3D communication, whether it\u2019s playing together, whether it\u2019s trying to graduate from high school together during the midst of covid, whether it\u2019s a simulation of our Roblox office inside Roblox. We go and have a simulation of our office, and we come together for serendipitous events, whether it\u2019s going to a concert. So our belief is, this type of technology is bigger than gaming. Gaming is a part of it, side-by-side concerts and working together, so I think we\u2019ve evolved to a utility vision of this type of platform.\nI think you made a prediction at RDC a couple of weeks ago about dating. You think people are going to be dating in Roblox.\nIt was really fun when we made this prediction because we were very careful on that slide. And then you saw the 17-plus people ID validated in 17-plus experiences.\nSo parents don\u2019t have a heart attack.\nYeah, yeah, yeah, given our history of safety and civility and the focus on that. But ultimately, what\u2019s really interesting about the dating market, there\u2019s probably a third of the population that won\u2019t go on Bumble or Tinder or Hinge or whatever just because of awkwardness. In an immersive 3D avatar-type communication where you can be Shrek and I can be whoever I want to be, there\u2019s actually a certain way to... I\u2019ll be Donald Duck.\nOkay. [Laughs]\nThere\u2019s actually a little bit of a breakdown of the friction, of the fear of a video call, so I actually do believe that\u2019ll happen. I do believe someday someone will build a dating app on Roblox. It\u2019ll be very safe. It\u2019ll be for 17-and-up people, and it\u2019ll be an interesting way for people to connect.\nTalk to me about this advertising push you guys are also making and how it connects to the changing demographics of the user base. Are they related? And how big do you see the ads business becoming?\nI think it\u2019s really interesting. The amount of engagement is north of 5 billion hours per month on the platform, and more and more of that is north of 17-year-old engagement. And when we think about what advertising is, a lot of it is fandom. It\u2019s seeing a poster of something I like, maybe historically seeing something in a newspaper. More recently seeing something as a web banner, and then more recently seeing something as a very native natural video segment or something like that. But we do believe there\u2019s something beyond that, which is the 3D experience. For example, if we\u2019re in a retail store together and we\u2019re shopping and we can remember what\u2019s on the shelf and how it looks, whether it\u2019s shoes or makeup or whatever, and we do think that\u2019s going to be a very, very powerful experience for brands.\nWe already have hundreds of brands on the platform. I was just seeing the most revised Gucci experience, which is radically amazing. It\u2019s a simulation of their runway show. And in those experiences, there\u2019s both brand recognition, which is maybe harder to measure. There starts to be the acquisition of virtual goods: Gucci purses and those kinds of things. And then, ultimately, there\u2019ll be at some point, not yet really announced or promised, physical shopping as well. That kind of shopping with your friend is a very social, fun experience.\nHow big do you see the ads business being? Is it something that could potentially be as big as your core business today?\n\u201cOur CFO\u2019s friend was ... walking by a Vans store, and younger people wanted to go in there because they were familiar with that from Vans World on Roblox.\u201d\nIt\u2019s interestingly big. We\u2019re in a great position because we generate a really good business without advertising. So it gives us an opportunity to layer this in for older people in a very civil way, in a very careful way. But I think it\u2019s arguably undetermined how big it is. We will see based on the power of the memories that people have in their brands. Anecdotally, our CFO\u2019s friend was in Santa Monica and walking by a Vans store, and younger people wanted to go in there because they were familiar with that from Vans World on Roblox. So building digital memories and connecting with brands that are fun and exciting and then merging that with the physical world is new, uncharted territory.\nOn the topic of growth, this is something I haven\u2019t heard you talk about since you went public. A big part of your growth narrative when you went public, it was mentioned many times in the prospectus, for example, was this joint venture you had with Tencent in China. And less than a year after you went public, it got shut down without explanation.\nYeah.\nI saw that your head of China is now your head of Japan.\nThat\u2019s right.\nWhere are you with China?\nTencent continues to be an amazing partner. We\u2019re being very, very careful in China. The dynamics in China right now have gone to the point where, rather than envisioning a fully connected-type network, we have to imagine an autonomous network. We\u2019re, in a sense, modernizing our infrastructure to the point where we can literally print a copy of Roblox in China and bring it to market there. So we continue to be very involved in China. We\u2019re optimistic about it. We have a great partnership with Tencent, but we\u2019re working on the infrastructure to support that.\nWhat does that mean, \u201can autonomous version\u201d of Roblox?\nI think as you would look at any other platform or any other social media-type company, we would look back over the last three to four years and see less and less information going back and forth between the US and China to the point where I think the future will be very little goes back, for example, in a China situation.\nSo you haven\u2019t given up on China?\nAbsolutely not. No.\nOkay, interesting. So you recently put Roblox on the Meta Quest headset, and it\u2019s not officially in the store yet, but you got 1 million installs in five days, and it was just in a beta where you have to go find it. You can\u2019t just go download it from the store.\nThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.\nWhere do you see VR going as it relates to Roblox? There\u2019s the Vision Pro. Have you tried the Vision Pro?\nI have not tried a Vision Pro.\nYou\u2019ve got to try it. Will you guys be on Vision Pro? Are you a big believer in this headset wave that\u2019s coming?\nI\u2019m a big believer, long term, that the most immersive form of 3D experience will be VR-type experience. There\u2019s some great sci-fi around what the far-off future of VR is. I think our vision is, because we are a platform and because we work so hard on\u2026 young creator shows up, builds something on Roblox, pushes a button, runs on any device, is auto-translated into any language, possibly that can build a business on top of that, there\u2019s a huge benefit to being very, very good on all devices and tracking the growth of devices. So we can contribute to the growth of Meta Quest, and I\u2019m excited about that. If someday there are 500,000 or 500 million VR headsets, Roblox will be a huge part of it, but I think we\u2019re not in the position of predicting the growth of any hardware device.\nWhat about AR? So not fully immersive, but AR glasses.\nAR is also super interesting, right? Is the future going to be mixed reality? Is the future going to be lighter weight, less overlaid type stuff? Is the future ultimately going to be some of the vision of some of the companies that have been started? Someday, I think I wrote a blog post about it 10 years ago, we will have full overlay, whether it\u2019s contact lenses, and it\u2019ll be lightweight and all of that. I think AR is very interesting when we think about immersive 3D communication because there\u2019s communication where we\u2019re simulating this world and we\u2019re sitting here together. There\u2019s also communication where grandma and grandpa are sitting at the kitchen table, and I think AR starts to support that vision of some people are on VR devices, some people are on AR devices. You can either put grandma and grandpa in the chair, or you can go to the favorite family destination. So I think it\u2019s very interesting.\nWe\u2019re going to have time for Q&A in a few minutes, so get your questions ready. We\u2019ll have time for three or four questions.\nYou and I, a few months ago when we did the interview for Decoder, we talked a lot about AI and this kind of analogy to... I don\u2019t know if people have seen the last season of Westworld. The main character has this job where she just goes in and talks to a computer and creates virtual worlds as a narrator. And you said you see that happening on Roblox in the not-too-distant future. You all talked a little bit more about this at RDC a couple of weeks ago. Where does generative AI intersect with what Roblox does?\nI think one way to think about this is three big AI clouds that are accelerating creation and supporting the platform. One of these clouds has been there for two or three years, no one knows it. Safety, automatic translation, moderation, efficiency, we\u2019ve been working on that for two or three years, and we probably have 70 AI pipelines to drive the efficiency of the business and the quality of the business.\nThe middle cloud, which I think is a lot of energy right now \u2014 generative \u2014 how easy is it to make creation happen for everyone? Vision on Roblox would be in addition to, say, competing on Project Runway and using digital scissors and a digital sewing machine, we would also use prompts. I\u2019d like a blue shirt, buttons this color, and AI will start to generate that.\nSo AI generative is very interesting for avatars, for clothing, for 3D experiences to really bring creation to everyone, and we\u2019re deep in on that. We\u2019ve already shipped AI code generation to help creators create. We\u2019ve shipped AI material generation. I think having a company with amazing... A lot of user data flowing can help support and train those types of models.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a third cloud way out there, which is starting to imagine having a virtual doppelganger ... that\u2019s the more sci-fi future.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a third cloud way out there, which is starting to imagine having a virtual doppelganger, for example. If you wanted someone to take your place, if you wanted someone to meet me for five minutes before our meeting to just kind of figure things out, I think that\u2019s the way-off-far future. And it\u2019s not just generative AI, but it\u2019s generative AI that might look and act like you in a virtual space. So that\u2019s the more sci-fi future.\nSo that\u2019s an AI trained on my Roblox persona and data to be like me?\nThat\u2019s right. If you so choose and you so want that, then that could be an opportunity.\nAudience Q&A\nAlex Heath: Dave is very good at these Q&As. He does them a lot at his conferences.\nDavid Baszucki: I don\u2019t. Oh, I do them with developers.\nAH: Yeah, I\u2019m just saying give him good questions. Give him hard questions.\nDB: Thank you, I think.\nCathy Hackl: Hi Alex and David. Cathy Hackl. I\u2019m a tech and gaming executive at Journey, a Roblox player, and the mother of an 11-year-old Roblox developer that makes about a hundred dollars a month from his builds.\nDB: Oh, my gosh.\nCH: So, yay. Yeah. During RDC, you gave one of your predictions. You said a top fashion designer will be discovered on Roblox without having any experience in physical fashion. What is the role of fashion in the future of Roblox and direct-to-avatar?\nDB: It\u2019s huge, right? Karlie [Kloss] is on our platform. Parsons [School of] Design did a partnership with us. At RDC, we saw a couple of the gowns that had been done in concert with some of the students there. They were absolutely amazing. So one could imagine reducing the friction of creativity for a fashion designer to ultimately virtual design \u2014 and then, ultimately, AI-supported design.\nIt\u2019s interesting to imagine this as a prototype environment for fashion. You can try a lot of things more quickly than building the physical. You can get crowd feedback. There will someday be experiences where early designs are voted on. We\u2019ve had things like that in a more simplistic way, and then you can imagine almost predicting what types of designs from top designers would be welcomed. So I think it\u2019s really big. Thank you.\nNeil Shankar: Hi, my name is Neil Shankar. I\u2019m a content creator. I have always thought of Roblox as largely a metaverse company. In fact, my introduction to the metaverse concepts was from a series of essays that Matthew Ball wrote a few years ago that Roblox was largely the center of. Recently, I\u2019ve become aware of a brand marketing push, I believe by your sports division, to distance yourselves from metaverse connotations. Can you please tell us about that?\nDB: I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s a distancing. We have evolved the terminology we\u2019ve used. We\u2019ve always used the term \u201chuman co-experience\u201d or \u201cbringing people together.\u201d The metaverse context, as we know, was coined with the book Snow Crash a long time ago. And it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s gone and ebbed through various flows. But I guess we imagine this more as a communication and connection platform. We\u2019ve never really used the term metaverse a lot, and I think going forward, we\u2019ll probably always think of ourselves as a communication and connection platform.\nAlex Kruglov: Hi, my name is Alex Kruglov. I run a startup called pop.in, which is also in the social gaming space but for a much older user base. I\u2019m curious: when you think about 24 hours in a day and you talk about the future that you see with a billion daily actives and all kinds of time spent not just playing games but anything from dating to shopping and so on, what are people not going to be doing and switching? Clay Christensen has this concept of jobs to be done. Who are they firing? What jobs are they firing in order to be on Roblox?\nI asked this from the point of view of a parent of three kids, the middle of whom \u2014 for all intents and purposes, it\u2019s crack when it comes to Roblox. It\u2019s highly, highly regulated by her parents.\nAH: Yeah, how dystopian is this going to be?\nDB: Yeah. We\u2019re actually very optimistic. And I think we\u2019re optimistic because, in the specter of social media, there\u2019s a wide range of things that people do on social media. Some consume a lot of short video content and trigger dopamine. Some are \u201ccompare my life with your life and accelerate FOMO.\u201d Some are hopefully similar to the feeling of, \u201cWell, my kid\u2019s on the phone with their friends. They\u2019re connecting, inventing, hanging out.\u201d So I\u2019m actually somewhat optimistic that the future of our direction is bringing people together when they can\u2019t be in real life.\nCasey Newton: Hi. Casey Newton from Platformer. When I look at Roblox, I see something that looks a lot like an app store that increasingly looks like it wants to be an operating system, which to me, would seem to put it on a kind of collision course with an iOS or an Android or maybe even the Oculus Store. So I wonder how you think about that and how you think you can get to that billion daily active people without owning your own hardware.\nDB: One thing to think about when we imagine millions of creators and we can go to ancient Egypt or we can go to our office or whatever in immersive 3D is that content cannot all be shipped to the device. It\u2019s just impossible to have that much content. So that content needs to come to the device in a very unique architecture where there\u2019s very low latency, there\u2019s a lot of local 3D simulation, but at the same time, on the cloud, that content needs to load and connect very fast. And I think this architectural inevitability of a 3D connection platform where we can go everywhere instantly is maybe what you\u2019re thinking about or referring to. I would say, Apple, these platforms, are very aware of this inevitable architecture for 3D and are actually very big supporters of it.\nAndrew Melnizek: Hey. Andrew with The Verge. Last week, we saw some leaked internal emails from Microsoft\u2019s Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, and he talked about the future of AAA game publishing and development. It\u2019s just really expensive. People have to take bigger bets to succeed, and it\u2019s getting harder and harder. I wanted to get your take, as someone who I would argue has defined the iPad kids generation, in what their relationship with games is going to be in the future as the model continues to change.\n\u201cWe have nothing near a bull\u2019s-eye on AAA gaming\u201d\nDB: Internally, we have nothing near a bull\u2019s-eye on AAA gaming. Internally, there\u2019s always a struggle to have all of our engineers working on midrange Android phones as a primary, very difficult platform. So I think our focus is on performance, on midrange, low-end devices, rather than the high-end. Over time, you could imagine even those low-end devices start to support more and more realism, and it becomes easier to deploy on the cloud, have an existing social network, and those kinds of things. So there may be some natural evolution but definitely nothing deliberate on our part.\nJay Peters: Hi. Jay Peters with The Verge. You mentioned walled gardens in terms of PlayStation and Xbox, but I kind of feel like Roblox is its own walled garden. We see lots of other shared virtual experience apps like Fortnite or Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds. Is there any chance or any thinking on some kind of interoperability between all that stuff?\nDB: I think there are two types of interoperability. One would just be on valuable items like a pair of shoes from Nike and whether the NFT supports the interchange. That may not be a 3D graphical technical spec; that may be a little bit more of a cloud ownership spec. I think that this genre is evolving so quickly to network hundreds of people to have realistic 3D. Are my shoes ultimately made of leather? Do they actually bend and flex? The technology is going to go so quickly here that any 3D interchange is going to be almost like a five-year-old file format. So I think, if you see maybe less interchange, I think it\u2019s less that way. We do bring in every type of industry file format that we can, and we\u2019re trying to open that up as fast as we can.\nJP: Do you think five years out, will there be energy toward creating some kind of interchangeable file format or is that something \u2014\nDB: I think there is already. I think because Roblox is based on, under the covers, really trying to be a 3D world simulator. The wheels fall off the car, the car falls on the ground, your clothing is made of cloth, those kinds of things \u2014 those file formats may not support a kind of physically rich description. So I imagine, for a long time, when we bring in avatar files or something, we\u2019ll be using AI to upsample them into a physical manifestation.\nJP: Thank you.\nAH: Alright, we\u2019re getting pulled off the stage here. Dave, thank you for the time.\n\nThis article, authored by Nilay Patel, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-12 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":539}
