Taipans at the buzzer, Cheatham injured as Sixers upset Breakers\n\nChris Goulding has fired off a season-high seven three-pointers to steer NBL ladder leaders Melbourne United to a 96-84 win over the Illawarra Hawks.\nOperating without injured guards Ian Clark (hamstring) and Matthew Dellavedova (concussion) on Sunday, Melbourne suffered a first-half scare when Luke Travers was forced off after a knock to his left knee.\nIt came as visitors Illawarra surged as much as 10 points clear during a high-scoring first half at John Cain Arena.\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\nBut United captain Goulding\u2019s hot hand kept his team in the contest as he drained 21 first-half points, including five three-pointers.\nGoulding finished with 33 points including seven triples \u2013 more than any other player in a game this season \u2013 as United\u2019s tough defence in the second half carried them home.\nShea Ili (17 points) and Tanner Krebs (14) also reached double figures for Melbourne.\nThe result extended United\u2019s winning streak to six games, giving them an 8-1 record on top of the ladder.\nImport forward Gary Clark (24 points) and Justin Robinson (20) tried to give Illawarra a lift but Tyler Harvey managed just 10 points, three days after his clutch three-pointer sealed a thrilling win over Cairns.\nAdvertisement\nIn a sloppy start, United committed five turnovers in the first period and trailed at quarter-time for the first time this season.\nClark\u2019s eight points on perfect shooting led Illawarra to a 29-24 advantage at that point.\nHis tally swelled to 16 by the main break and the Hawks\u2019 lead reached double figures soon after United temporarily lost Travers to injury.\nBut Goulding caught fire to lead United to a 52-51 at the main break.\nDefence was key in the second half as both sides tightened up, with Melbourne holding the visitors to just 15 points in the final period.\nTravers returned after half-time, finishing with six

NBL resurgence with a tense 90-87 win.\nDespite being without star big Aron Baynes (suspended) and import guard Shannon Scott (hamstring), the Bullets soared to a second straight victory on Sunday and snapped a quirky streak in the process.\nIt was their first win after seven straight losses in Sunday fixtures, in a run that dates back to last season.\nFar more importantly, the result levelled Brisbane\u2019s current season record at 4-4 after five rounds.\nBut it didn\u2019t come easily as fourth-quarter specialists Tasmania trimmed a seven-point deficit back to a single point when Majok Deng drove to the rack with 34 seconds remaining.\nAdvertisement\nThe two sides traded blows in the dying stages and the JackJumpers almost sent the game to overtime when they pinched Sam McDaniel\u2019s inbounds pass on the final play.\nJack McVeigh got a hand in to force the turnover and Tasmania found Jordon Crawford, but his decent look at an attempted game-leveller rimmed out.\nThe JackJumpers, who trailed by seven at three-quarter time, kept alive their record of winning every fourth term this season, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\nBrisbane captain Sobey led from the front as defensive specialist Mitch Norton kept Tasmania\u2019s import Crawford (16 points) relatively quiet until the final period.\nTyrrell Harrison and Josh Bannan (10 points each) were important for the Bullets, while Chris Smith (11) and Isaac White (10) gave solid contributions off the bench.\nThe gut-wrenching loss ended a horror round five for the JackJumpers, who lost at home to Melbourne United before going down to the Bullets.\nAdvertisement\nIt left them with a 4-4 record after a strong 4-2 start to the season.\nMcVeigh (18 points) and Deng (17) gave strong offensive contributions for Tasmania, who lost Marcus Lee for the final few minutes after the starting centre fouled out.\nTaipans import injured in win over Kings\nA nasty back injury to first-year import sensation Patrick Miller has marred the Taipans\u2019 otherwise impressive 87-80 win over Sydney at the Cairns Convention Centre.\nMiller, who entered Saturday night\u2019s clash ranked second in the NBL in scoring and fourth in assists, had the hosts in control before an explosive drive to the bucket ended with him crashing to the floor, 1:09 out from halftime.\nThe American\u2019s head whip-lashed onto the floor before he got up gingerly and walked slowly to the bench holding his lower back, unable to continue.\nStepping up were acting skipper Bul Kuol (24, played all 40 minutes) and big Sam Waardenburg (22) for the Snakes, who shrugged off last Thursday\u2019s buzzer-beating heartbreak in Illawarra by taking the NBL\u2019s most prized scalp.\nAdvertisement\nIt shot them from fifth to third on the ladder, while sending the Kings slumping from second to fourth.\n\u201cWe kept moving down the bench to bring guys in,\u201d Cairns coach Adam Forde said. \u201cEveryone responded.\n\u201cI\u2019m super happy for the group that they could fill some short-term reward with a win at home.\u201d\nEx-Taipan Kouat Noi (18 points) top-scored for the visitors, while Jaylen Adams (13) and DJ Hogg (13) \u2013 playing against his former side in his long-awaited debut for his new team following a shoulder injury \u2013 got on the scoresheet, but both shot under 30 per cent, embodying the Kings\u2019 rocky evening.\nThe two-time reigning champions were all at sea early, out-rebounded 18-6 in the opening term while missing their first 15 three-pointers.\nCairns boosted their 26-20 quarter-time buffer to 12 points shortly before Miller\u2019s night ended in stomach-churning style.\nAdvertisement\nThe injury left their backcourt stocks further depleted, with Taran Armstrong (foot) and captain Tahjere McCall (family reasons) already missing.\nWithout Miller running the point, the home side\u2019s offence suddenly looked shaky in the third term as Sydney briefly took the lead on a Hogg triple.\nThe undermanned Taipans responded with a 15-0 burst either side of three-quarter time, highlighted by Swedish young gun Bobi Klintman\u2019s thunderous dunk down the middle over rival Next Star Alex Toohey.\nDown by 14, Sydney closed the gap to four points before unsportsmanlike fouls against Denzel Valentine and Makuach Maluach ended their revival.\nLamenting \u201cthe defensive mistakes that we made\u201d, Kings coach Mahmoud Abdelfattah added: \u201cThey made more plays than we did, they got to the 50\/50 balls and they stuck together.\n\u201cKudos to them, they deserved it.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nPhoenix hold off fast-finishing Breakers\nSouth East Melbourne Phoenix have survived a massive late scare to clinch a tense 103-100 victory over the fast-finishing New Zealand Breakers at John Cain Arena.\nThe Phoenix were eyeing off a percentage pile-on when they led by a whopping 26 points on Saturday before the bottom-placed, injury-hit Breakers produced a brave rearguard to almost pinch a miracle.\nThe Phoenix\u2019s big four \u2013 Alan Williams (21 points, 13 rebounds), Mitch Creek (20 points), Gary Browne (18 points, eight assists) and Will Cummings (16 points, all in the first half) \u2013 led the way but the final stages got too close for comfort.\nElectrifying American point guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright (33 points, eight assists) and Finn Delany (21 points) were instrumental in the 32-19 fourth-quarter fightback from the Breakers, who were brave despite succumbing to their fourth successive defeat.\n\u201cWe were one lucky bounce away from winning this game,\u201d NZ coach Mody Maor said. \u201cOur guys are doing everything they can and everything I ask of them everyday. \u201cThey are working as hard as can be. Our fans should be proud of the level of effort our guys put in.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThey were without import power forward Zylan Cheatham, who suffered a broken foot in last Thursday\u2019s loss to Adelaide, and Williams duly proved a beast in the low block against the undersized Anthony Lamb.\nBehind Williams\u2019 dominance and Browne\u2019s ball-handling and playmaking wizardry, the Phoenix pulled ahead 31-21 at quarter-time.\nCummings scored at will in the second stanza before Creek inspired a 16-0 third-quarter burst for the home side, whose advantage swelled to 80-54.\nNZ reverted to a zone defence and centre Mangok Mathiang impacted at both ends as the Breakers went 17-2 either side of three-quarter-time to haul themselves back into the contest.\nQuicksilver Cartwright-Jackson poured in 10 points inside three minutes to reduce the margin to three points down the stretch before Williams\u2019 hook and Browne\u2019s free throw iced it narrowly.\n\u201cIt was frustrating to see the lead dwindle,\u201d Phoenix coach Mike Kelly said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a win. The guys are going in the right direction. \u201cI\u2019m not disappointed, I\u2019m stoked.\u201d\nBullets shoot down weakened Wildcats\nAdvertisement\nThe Brisbane Bullets have shrugged off the absence of two important players to outwork the Wildcats at their home RAC Arena in Perth and produce a performance full of heart for their 84-79 NBL win.\nBoth teams were 2-4 coming into Friday\u2019s match and on losing slides, but it was the Wildcats who had the pressure building, even with the Bullets being without key pair, the suspended Aron Baynes and injured Shannon Scott.\nBrisbane scored the first seven points before opening up a 20-point lead in the third quarter and going on to win by five after holding out against a furious late charge from the home team.\nThe team effort of the Bullets was outstanding as they got another 17 points from captain Nathan Sobey.\nChris Smith put up 16 points, Josh Bannan 15 and Tyrell Harrison 12 to go with five rebounds and three blocks in just 14 minutes.\nFirst-year Bullets coach Justin Schueller couldn\u2019t have been prouder of his team.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt was a big game for us having dropped four, with two marquees out and we knew we had to come in here and play near a perfect game,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy initial thought is just pleasure in how the guys stuck to a plan, and found our advantages consistently throughout the night.\u201d\nThe Wildcats missed 18 of their first 19 three-point attempts before making a couple midway through the last quarter from Keanu Pinder, who finished with 22 points and five rebounds.\nHe was a lone shining light for a Wildcats team, who have lost four straight. Again, superstar Bryce Cotton struggled to 10 points and five assists on 3-of-19 shooting.\n\u201cMy words during the week were that we\u2019re just not playing good, that showed again tonight,\u201d Perth coach John Rillie said.\n\u201cOur offence isn\u2019t functioning very good right now.

{"title":"Why the\u00a0Apple Watch\u00a0is being banned \u2014 and how Apple can avoid it","context":"## Why the\u00a0Apple Watch\u00a0is being banned \u2014 and how Apple can avoid it\n\nEarlier this year, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled that Apple had infringed on two patents from medical device maker Masimo. As a result, the ITC said it would impose an import ban on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 starting December 26th. At the time it was hard to believe that this would actually come to pass: Apple gets sued all the time, and even when it loses, how often does it actually face dramatic consequences?\nWell, now would be one of those times. Experts say that, barring a Christmas miracle, it\u2019s unlikely that Apple will find a way to escape the ban. Case in point, the company shocked everyone yesterday when it decided to preemptively pull the watches from its online store starting December 21st at 3PM ET. And after the 24th, they\u2019ll disappear from Apple Stores, too.\n\u201cI think Apple sees the writing on the wall and they\u2019re preparing themselves,\u201d says Ben Levi, a partner at Levi Snotherly & Schaumberg, which has experience litigating ITC disputes.\nIt\u2019s rare to see Big Tech lose \u2014 and with such tangible consequences at that. There are still ways that Apple can keep the watches on sale, but it\u2019ll likely take a lot of waiting or a lot of money to make it happen.\nHow Apple got here\nThis ban is the result of a long-standing patent dispute between Apple and the medical device maker Masimo. The latter is known for its pulse oximetry tech, generally referred to as SpO2 or blood oxygen saturation in the wearable world, and it claims that Apple is using that patented technology without permission.\nThis particular story started about 10 years ago when Apple reached out to Masimo about a potential partnership around blood oxygen features on its wearables. Soon after, Apple reportedly poached several Masimo engineers and its chief medical officer. And then in fall 2020, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 6 \u2014 its first Apple Watch to feature an SpO2 sensor to measure blood oxygen saturation levels.\nThe SpO2 sensors measure blood oxygen levels and are at the heart of this patent dispute. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nIn 2020, Masimo filed a lawsuit in the US District Court in the Central District of California accusing Apple of stealing trade secrets and infringing on 10 of its patents. That case dragged on and on, so Masimo then filed a separate case with the ITC in 2021. Then last year, Apple sued Masimo back, claiming the company made an Apple Watch clone with its Masimo W1 Medical Watch. Clearly, there\u2019s some bad blood here. But in this case, the important thing is that the ITC sided with Masimo. In January 2023, it ruled that Apple Watches did in fact infringe on Masimo patents.\nThe ITC then issued an import ban in October, as well as an order to stop selling products infringing on Masimo\u2019s patents that had already been imported. We\u2019re currently nearing the end of a 60-day presidential review period, in which President Joe Biden or the US Trade Representative (USTR) has the opportunity to veto the ban. If there\u2019s no veto by the time the review period ends, the ban will go into effect.\nBut will Biden actually veto?\nApple getting a presidential veto would be like lightning striking the same place twice.\n\u201cIt is extraordinarily rare for the President to overturn a decision from the International Trade Commission and in my view, [it\u2019s] unlikely in this particular case,\u201d says Andrei Iancu, co-chair of the Council for Innovation Promotion (C4IP) and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, who was also the director of the US Patent and Trademark Office from 2018 to 2021.\nTo get a veto, a company usually has to show a public interest or health policy basis \u2014 and that isn\u2019t the case here. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that the import exclusion order will be disapproved by the USTR and the president,\u201d says Smith Brittingham, partner at Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, LLP. \u201cThe only real answer would be, \u2018Well, it\u2019s Apple.\u2019\u201d\nThat said, Apple did manage to beat the system once. In 2013, then President Barack Obama vetoed an import ban on the iPhone. At the time, Samsung accused Apple of infringing on its cellular data patents. But in that case, according to Levi, Apple was able to make the argument that there were issues regarding fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory licensing (FRAND). The patents involved were considered standard and essential, and the Obama administration was concerned the import ban would give Samsung \u201cundue leverage.\u201d Plus, it only impacted the iPhone 4 and older models of the iPad. Newer iPhones didn\u2019t use an infringing chipset. In the case of the Apple Watch, Apple doesn\u2019t have any of these arguments.\n\u201cIn that case 10 years ago, Apple really rolled the dice and the pulled the rabbit out of the hat. It\u2019s very unlikely for them to do that again,\u201d says Levi.\nWhere does Apple go from here?\nA hail mary veto is unlikely, but that doesn\u2019t mean Apple is just going to accept an import ban on a $17 billion segment of its business. Apple spokesperson Nikki Rothberg told The Verge in a statement that the company was \u201cpursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers.\u201d That means the watch is going back on sale one way or another \u2014 it\u2019s just a question of what path Apple takes.\nApple has already indicated that it plans to appeal, but appealing is a lengthy process that can take around 18 months. The company will also probably ask for a stay on the import ban, but Brittingham says that\u2019s not likely to be granted because Apple would have to prove that it would be irreparably harmed. In other words, it\u2019d have to make a convincing case that it would go out of business if it can\u2019t sell the Apple Watch.\nApple says it\u2019s exploring both legal and technical options to get around this import ban. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nWhile the Apple Watch is a popular product and makes up for roughly 30 percent of the smartwatch market, Apple won\u2019t go under if the Apple Watch is out of commission in just the US. It\u2019ll hurt to lose such an important market, but it can still sell all three of its Apple Watch models abroad. Similarly, the import ban wouldn\u2019t affect every Apple Watch. The entry-level SE is unaffected by the ban as it doesn\u2019t have blood oxygen sensing capabilities.\nThe SE points to one way for Apple to sidestep the import ban altogether. According to both Brittingham and Levi, Apple could redesign its Apple Watch to avoid the infringed patents until the appeals process is done. Theoretically, all Apple has to do is push out a firmware update that disables the SpO2 sensor and then it could go right back to importing Apple Watches for sale.\nAnd there are indications that Apple is actively pursuing that option. Bloomberg reports that Apple engineers are scrambling to alter the blood oxygen algorithms on the watches. The report quotes an unnamed Apple spokesperson saying the company plans to submit a workaround to the US customs agency to get the product back on shelves.\nDo Apple\u2019s SpO2 sensors even matter? Speaking as a wearables reviewer, removing the SpO2 sensors wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world for Apple in the short term. Apple\u2019s blood oxygen features are mostly for wellness and sleep tracking \u2014 and they\u2019re not that useful beyond determining your nightly baseline. I\u2019m willing to bet the average Apple Watch user forgets that the blood oxygen features even exist. In the case of the Apple Watch, it periodically takes SpO2 readings in the background, or you can actively take a spot check. However, Apple itself doesn\u2019t really make wide use of these metrics. It\u2019s not like how the watch uses its EKG capabilities to detect atrial fibrillation. On consumer wearables, SpO2 features generally have no medical use cases. They\u2019re essentially for \u201centertainment\u201d purposes, and we\u2019ve repeatedly reported that you should never, ever use them as any sort of replacement for traditional pulse oximeters. The only real blow for Apple is if the rumors are correct and it\u2019s working on sleep apnea detection. Losing the sensors in that instance would make developing this feature harder. However, that feature would require a lengthy FDA clearance process. That means more advanced health features like sleep apnea detection are more of a medium to long-term concern \u2014 and it\u2019s very possible that Apple will have a workaround by the time such features are ready for consumers.\nThat said, for this route to be successful, Iancu says it depends on the specific patent, ITC ruling, and what exactly Apple has planned as far as redesigning the product.\n\u201cFrom a legal perspective, whatever change Apple makes has to be significant enough to avoid the patent, and it cannot be what\u2019s called a \u2018colorable\u2019 difference. Minor changes will not be sufficient,\u201d Iancu says.\nBasically, Apple can\u2019t simply make a small tweak to the code and call it a day. Masimo claims that the patents are hardware related, so even completely disabling the sensor may not work depending on how the patent is written. Apple could remove it entirely from the design, but that would require mucking around with Apple\u2019s meticulous supply chain and could take some time.\nThen there are the options that would cost Apple some money. Apple could sit down with Masimo and hammer out a licensing deal for the infringed patents. In a New York Times interview, Masimo CEO Joe Kiani said Apple \u201chad not engaged in licensing negotiations.\u201d It\u2019s an easy-seeming fix, so why not do it? For starters, both parties have to want to settle.\n\u201cApple is a tough nut to crack,\u201d says Brittingham, noting that Apple is one of the most sued companies in Silicon Valley. The company\u2019s large cash reserves also make taking Apple to court a costly endeavor. Masimo, for example, has reportedly spent $60 million litigating the issue thus far. \u201cI think they tend to hold out as long as possible in order to make it less appetizing to sue Apple.\u201d\nThe other option is for Apple to avoid the import ban altogether. Iancu says Apple could simply decide to manufacture the watches within the US instead of overseas \u2014 but that\u2019s a significant supply chain change that\u2019s unlikely to happen any time soon.\nDoes this set a precedent?\nThis import ban isn\u2019t the only one Apple is facing. In February, the Biden administration also declined to veto another ITC import ban and cease-and-desist order stemming from a dispute with AliveCor over the Apple Watch\u2019s EKG features. Like Masimo, AliveCor argued that Apple stole its tech to develop the wearable EKG feature, thereby infringing on its patents. However, while the two cases look similar, the result of one doesn\u2019t speak to how the other will play out.\n\u201cEvery case is different, every patent is different,\u201d says Levi. \u201cDifferent complainants who bring up a case have got their own businesses, their own products, and those implicate a whole different set of facts.\u201d\nThe Apple Watch SE will remain unaffected because it doesn\u2019t have a blood oxygen sensor. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nCase in point, while the ITC granted AliveCor\u2019s import ban, it hasn\u2019t had any impact because the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled that AliveCor\u2019s EKG tech isn\u2019t actually patentable. AliveCor would have to win its appeal to that ruling before any Apple Watches with EKG features would be pulled from the market for that reason.\nEven so, Iancu says everything is working as it ought to. \u201cThe takeaway is that the system is working as originally intended. If Apple wants to have products imported into the US, it should make sure that it comes up with its original inventions and does not infringe on other people\u2019s patented technology.\u201d\nUltimately, if this import ban goes through \u2014 which it\u2019s looking a lot like it will \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll never be able to buy another Apple Watch in the US. As mentioned, the SE remains completely unaffected. In the short term, the ban also doesn\u2019t forbid third-party resellers from selling their inventory of Series 9 or Ultra 2. Once they run out, only then it may pose a problem if they can\u2019t buy more units from Apple.\n\nThis article, authored by Victoria Song, was published by The Verge on 2023-12-19 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":241}
{"title":"Ten Hag\u2019s gamble pays off against Chelsea as McTominay steals show | Jonathan Liew","context":"## Ten Hag\u2019s gamble pays off against Chelsea as McTominay steals show | Jonathan Liew\n\nImagine what Manchester United could do if Erik ten Hag hadn\u2019t already lost the dressing room. Yes, it\u2019s been another of those weeks at Old Trafford: rancour, rumour and recrimination, barbs in the press and barbs at the press, defeat at Newcastle followed by this stirring recovery against Chelsea, and the startling realisation that United are now three points behind Manchester City. It\u2019s still only Thursday, by the way.\nPerhaps ultimately this win only buys Ten Hag a few days\u2019 grace, a warm flume of goodwill that lasts only as long as it takes for Dominic Solanke to run through on goal for Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon. Back in the grip of crisis, back in the now-familiar lexicon of surly unsourced stories about dressing room discontent. Such is the way of things at football\u2019s most reliable content provider. This beast must always eat.\nBut block out the noise for just a moment, as of course United cannot, and something interesting is happening here. This was a win that felt a lot tighter than it really was: United inexplicably hanging on at the end despite enjoying 28 shots and an xG tally of 4.07. For long periods United played some of their most authentically thrilling football of the season, a doctrine of relentless attack that had Diogo Dalot flying forward from right-back even as the minutes ticked down.\nIt was also a game that felt more chaotic than it really was. In fact the slippery, slingy nature of the play was largely by design: United hollowing out their midfield in order to throw bodies forward, Chelsea hollowing out theirs in order to leave men up for the breakaway. It was a game that hung on United\u2019s determination to keep allowing Chelsea counterattacks, and Chelsea\u2019s determination to keep messing them up. It was a game, above all, that hung on the curious main character energy of Scott McTominay.\nUnited fans will no doubt note the rich irony in the fact that these days McTominay is basically doing the job they once paid Paul Pogba to do. Marauding midfield engine and late-running goal threat; the all-action superhero who can chip in with 10 goals a season and pull off slide tackles that make the highlight reels. It never quite worked out for Pogba at United, largely \u2013 if you believe his most vehement critics \u2013 on account of his hair. McTominay is a different kind of player with a different kind of skillset. But for all the undoubted leadership qualities of Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire, tactically it is McTominay running the show right now: a development with numerous interesting consequences.\nHere he scored his fifth and sixth goals of the season. Previously he has never got more than seven. Where is this coming from? Partly from the fact that opponents have still not quite cottoned on to McTominay\u2019s goal threat, those late runs to the far post, the blur on the edge of the 18-yard box that you don\u2019t spot until it\u2019s too late. But partly, too, it is a function of how Ten Hag is using him.\nErik ten Hag (right) and Mitchell van der Gaag, his assistant, talk tactics during the game. Photograph: Ash Donelon\/Manchester United\/Getty Images\nUnlike his previous more conventional midfield roles, these days McTominay basically has a licence to create overloads wherever he finds them. Against low blocks and structured defences \u2013 and nobody is remotely accusing Chelsea of possessing one of those \u2013 he provides the extra body in a tightly marked penalty area. But he also pops up in the channels, on the wing, either supporting the man in possession or offering himself for the quick switch of play.\nGreat times for a great guy. But, of course, if you commit a midfielder to this role, then you leave gaps elsewhere. One of the reasons Chelsea found it so easy to play through United was that, with the forwards pushed high and McTominay as the secret sauce in the final third, there were open spaces every time they played through the press. Chelsea\u2019s goal was a case in point: two simple vertical passes straight through the centre via Mykhailo Mudryk to Cole Palmer, passes that McTominay could see coming but could do precious little to stop.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps in another game United come up against a better finisher than Nicolas Jackson, who for all his talent looks like a man playing football in a hall of mirrors. This is the high-wire act that Ten Hag is enacting: a daring gamble that United will gain more going forward than they lose going back.\nThat once Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Rapha\u00ebl Varane come back, once he brings the defensive line up 10 yards, once Rasmus H\u00f8jlund hits some form, once Mason Mount gets up to speed, lawless abandon will begin to resemble a sustainable attacking blueprint. That he can shout down the noise in the short term while building something in the long term. Right now, in the raptured afterglow of a big win, it feels like a gamble being won. But best to come back and check in a few days, just to make sure.\n\nThis article, authored by Jonathan Liew at Old Trafford, was published by The Guardian on 2023-12-06 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":242}

In that same spirit, we asked several writers to recommend books that you and other TechCrunch readers may want to gift this holiday season.\nRead on for recommendations from:\nThe responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity. This article contains links to affiliate partners where available. When you buy through these links, TechCrunch may earn an affiliate commission.\nJon Evans\nYou may know Jon Evans as a former TechCrunch columnist or from his engineering and CTO roles, but he is also a novelist. Most of his books are technothrillers painting travelers caught in tricky situations in exotic locations. \u201cExadelic\u201d is different, and not just because it\u2019s his first novel in over a decade: It is set in Silicon Valley, where a tech exec gets threatened by a rogue AI.\nBook recommendation: \u201cThe Steerswoman,\u201d by Rosemary Kirstein\nI love books which turn out to be far deeper, richer, and more thought-provoking than they originally seem, and the series of novels which begin with The Steerswoman are my go-to example of just that. Read just the first few chapters, and you\u2019ll think you \u201cknow\u201d you\u2019re reading a clich\u00e9d fantasy novel, albeit better-written and more feminist than most; two adventurer women meet in a medieval-ish tavern, in a land plagued by dragons, and commence a quest to discover the source of mysterious \u2013 some say magical \u2013 gems. You might be a bit surprised by the asides in which they begin to discuss math and physics, but still, clearly a fairly forgettable genre fantasy story \u2026 right? \u2026Wrong. Very, very wrong. Instead (and I\u2019m sorry for spoilering this, but it\u2019s impossible to write about this series without either doing so or being maddeningly elliptic) these books are some of the least fantastic, most meticulously thought-out science fiction you will ever read. More, they are a meditation on science itself, on how and why we acquire knowledge, on the repercussions of that knowledge being hoarded rather than shared \u2026 and on the inevitable(?) inequities, oppressions, and breakdowns between communities that result. They\u2019re also a whole lot of fun! Not just an ongoing puzzle to be solved, but a series of genuinely thrilling, funny, and wrenching adventures, populated by great characters, to experience from the edge of your seat. Read the first, and if you like it \u2014 and I bet you will \u2014 lucky you; the sequels are even better.\nKashmir Hill\nKashmir Hill\u2019s book \u201cYour Face Belong to Us\u201d is the story of a \u201csmall AI company that gave facial recognition to law enforcement, billionaires and businesses, threatening to end privacy as we know it.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t need to resort to (science) fiction to make it chilling; the company in question is Clearview AI, which very much exists, and its Dutch publisher describes the book as a \u201creal-life thriller.\u201d\nBook recommendation: \u201cThe Listeners: A History of Wiretapping in the United States,\u201d by Brian Hochman\nI\u2019m fascinated by the intersection of privacy and technology and how we navigate the clashes between the two. Hochman, a professor of American Studies at Georgetown, looks back to a historical moment when society was confronted with an intrusive new technology\u2014tiny recording devices and wiretaps\u2014and how new norms and laws developed to address it. To the extent that past is prologue, I found it very compelling for framing my expectations for what\u2019s to come with the newest and most shocking forms of mass data collection and use.\nJerry Neumann\n\u201cFounder vs Investor,\u201d a recently published non-fiction book, crosses two perspectives on venture-backed startups; entrepreneur Elizabeth Zalman is the founder, and veteran VC Jerry Neumann is the investor. Together, they share insights on how both sides can best work with one another.\nBook recommendation: \u201cHow Data Happened: A History from the Age of Reason to the Age of Algorithms,\u201d by Chris Wiggins and Matthew L. Jones\nTen years ago data was \u201cthe new oil\u201d. Now it\u2019s something more\u2026 read the tech news and you have to wonder if anything else even matters. As a humanist, I hope so, but I don\u2019t think you can reason about that unless you know the history. \u201cHow Data Happened\u201d is that history. Wiggins and Jones cover the idea of data from the advent of statistics through today. The book is well-researched, as you\u2019d expect from a couple of Columbia\u2019s top professors, but it\u2019s also an interesting and engaging read. It\u2019s a perfect gift for anyone who wants to know how our data-driven society got to where we are today and where it might take us tomorrow.\nBarr Moses\nBarr Moses is the CEO and co-founder of Monte Carlo, a data observability startup. She also co-wrote a technical book on the topic: O\u2019Reilly\u2019s \u201cData Quality Fundamentals: A Practitioner\u2019s Guide to Building Trustworthy Data Pipelines,\u201d sharing advice on achieving reliable data at scale.\nBook recommendation: \u201cDare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts,\u201d by Bren\u00e9 Brown\nReading a Bren\u00e9 Brown book is like tackling the Sunday crossword puzzle \u2013 equal parts challenging and rejuvenating \u2013 and Dare to Lead is no different. Dare to Lead pulls on Brown\u2019s decades of research, interviews, and experience as a professor at the University of Houston speaking with CEOs, founders, and other executives to understand what great leadership looks like and how to achieve it. She distills four key skill sets great leaders possess and highlights ways to empower employees to be courageous in the face of adversity and change. Published in 2018 before the Gen AI wave hit, Dare to Lead also addresses what human leaders have to bring to the table that AI and ML currently don\u2019t \u2013 empathy and connection. Bonus: the book also provides helpful resources to assess leadership strengths and growth opportunities that can make for a fun and informative team building activity.\nPolina Marinova Pompliano\nIt\u2019s her newsletter The Profile that led Polina Marinova Pompliano to become an author. \u201cAfter years of profiling hundreds of fascinating people, I asked myself: What distinguishes the great from the truly exceptional?\u201d This led to her first book, \u201cHidden Genius: The Secret Ways of Thinking That Power the World\u2019s Most Successful People.\u201d\nBook recommendation: \u201cIt\u2019s What I Do: A Photographer\u2019s Life of Love and War,\u201d by Lynsey Addario\nWar photojournalist Lynsey Addario has covered every major conflict and humanitarian crisis on the planet. As she sees the destruction and the pain through the lens of her camera, her images translate that intense emotion to people across the globe. Her memoir \u2018It\u2019s What I Do\u2019 is the story of how she risks her life to tell the stories of ordinary people living in extraordinarily dangerous places. In the chaotic times we\u2019re living through right now, it\u2019s a memoir that documents the human cost of war. Despite witnessing so much tragedy and brutality, she has never lost her ability to see the good in humanity. My favorite quote from the book is: \u201cI choose to live in peace and witness war\u2014to experience the worst in people but to remember the beauty.\u201d\nGeorgiana Laudi\nGeorgiana (Gia) Laudi helps SaaS businesses grow through her agency, Forget the Funnel. This is also the title of the book she co-wrote with her co-founder Claire Suellentrop, and whose premise is to present readers with a \u201ca customer-led approach for driving predictable, recurring revenue.\u201d\nBook recommendation: \u201cLoved: How to Rethink Marketing for Tech Products,\u201d by Martina Lauchengco\nProduct Marketing, particularly in tech, is one of the most foundational and yet also somehow wildly misunderstood disciplines. \u201cLoved\u201d by Martina Lauchengco is exactly the comprehensive guide the startup scene so desperately needed. She manages to strike the perfect blend of accessible and comprehensive so that everyone from founders to practitioners understand the critical role product marketing plays in successful companies and what good looks like at every stage of growth. Though I think what I appreciate the most about this book is that when it comes to marketing and driving product adoption, even though she introduces four fundamentals of product marketing, the first and most critical to get right is customer insight. This is almost unheard of given the target market for this book is an industry where engineering and scale reign supreme.\nScott Hurff\nAs a writer, Scott Hurff doesn\u2019t always write about product design; but when he does he is able to share his perspective as someone who\u2019s also a product maker and designer. It is also this intersection that nurtured his book, \u201cDesigning Products People Love: How Great Designers Create Successful Products.\u201d\nBook recommendation: \u201cGetting Real: The Smarter, Faster, Easier Way to Build a Successful Web Application,\u201d by Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson and Matthew Linderman\n\u201cGetting Real\u201d is an absolute treasure from 2006 and it\u2019s still teaching me things. It was the first time anyone building in modern tech put together a practical, straightforward, all-encompassing guide for conceiving, building, shipping, and marketing web apps. Jason and David\u2019s words are efficient when they need to be, detailed when it matters, and packed full of nuance that\u2019s both unique and endearing. The book feels like it started as an internal series of posts or a handbook to help scale 37signals beyond the core team (from what I remember, Basecamp launched in 2004 and had quickly found success). Whatever the format, what lends \u201cGetting Real\u201d authenticity is the fact that 37signals used these exact techniques to ship Basecamp and find its customer base. To this day, I\u2019ve never read anything like it. It\u2019s one of those books that you can finish in an afternoon but stays with you for far longer, morphing into a reference book for the times when you need some extra perspective.\nJames Wise\nYou may know James Wise as a partner at VC firm Balderton Capital; but this London-based VC also wrote his first book, \u201cStart-up Century: Why We\u2019re All Becoming Entrepreneurs \u2013 and How to Make It Work for Everyone.\u201d Launched in the U.K. on November 23, it should make a great gift for aspiring entrepreneurs around you.\nBook recommendation: \u201cThe Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the 21st Century\u2019s Greatest Dilemma,\u201d by Mustafa Suleyman with Michael Bhaskar\n\nThis article, authored by Anna Heim, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-01 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":243}

That\u2019s what happens when you change the punch,\" Canelo said about the knockdown.\nCanelo pursued Charlo and realized very quickly that his opponent was overmatched. With Charlo spending most of the fight with his back against the ropes, Canelo rumbled forward and slugged away at the body, fired an efficient jab, and landed the occasional hook to the head.\nThere wasn't much that Canelo could do aside from following Charlo around and looking for an opening to land power shots. That opportunity presented itself in the seventh round when a body shot was followed by a right hand to the temple which caused Charlo to take a knee.\nAfter that, it was a game of survival for Charlo.\nWith fans filtering out in the later rounds due to an insurmountable lead, Canelo appeared to become annoyed with Charlo's unwillingness to engage. The scores reflected that as Canelo won with tallies of 119-108, 118-109 & 118-109.\n\"Nobody can beat this Canelo,\" \"Cinco De Mayo. I'll come back and fight anybody. I don't f---ing care.\"\nCanelo (59-2-2, 39 KOs) successfully made his third defense of the undisputed super middleweight championship. He unified all four major titles when he knocked out Caleb Plant in November 2021.\nAfter suffering a hiccup when he fell short in attempting to gain light heavyweight gold against Dmitry Bivol, the 33-year-old superstar has now won three fights in a row and will wait to see what's next. The obvious choice for many is a megafight with undisputed welterweight champion Terence Crawford. However, Crawford would need to move up 21 pounds for that fight to happen and he's engaged in a potential rematch with Errol Spence.\nOther options appear to be David Benavidez and Jermell's older brother, Jermall Charlo.\nAs for Charlo, he still owns the IBF, WBA, and WBC championships and can return to the 154-pound division to defend those titles. Charlo called out Crawford, but after this performance, it is unlikely that Crawford would be interested.\nHere's how it all went down in Las Vegas.\nCanelo Alvarez vs. Jermell Charlo live updates, results, highlights\nRound Twelve: Canelo chops Charlo with a short right.

Canelo with a hard right hand and a left to the body. He's tenderizing the body with these hooks.

Canelo Alvarez vs. Jermell Charlo for Canelo's undisputed super middleweight championship. We're going to round-by-round coverage from here on out! Stay tuned!\nErickson Lubin takes controversial decision over Jesus Ramos in snoozer\nScores: 115-113, 116-112 & 117-111\n11:29 p.m. ET: Well, that was surprising. It felt like Ramos was in control but all three judges found a way to give Ramos the decision. Although it wasn't a great fight, it certainly didn't appear to be a close fight and it definitely wasn't one that Lubin appeared to be winning. Alas, Lubin won a fight that few will remember outside of the controversial decision.\n11:16 p.m. ET: Two rounds left and this crowd is fed up with the lack of action between Ramos and Lubin. Fans are more interested in watching the celebrities walk in.\n11:04 p.m. ET: Through seven rounds, Ramos has been in control in what has been a relatively tame affair with Lubin. Nothing much to write home about. Just a workman-like effort from Ramos as he continues to apply pressure while Lubin seems content to fight off of his backfoot. It's not great.\n10:24 p.m. ET: Co-main event is up next as Jesus Ramos (20-0, 16 KOs) faces Erickson Lubin (25-2, 18 KOs) in a WBC\/WBA super welterweight title eliminator.\nBarrios claims interim WBC welterweight title with wide decision over Ugas\nScores: 117-108, 118-107 & 118-107\n10:08 p.m. ET: We had some added drama down the stretch as Barrios dropped Ugas, who appeared to be on the verge of getting stopped. Ugas spit out his mouthpiece on two occasions to slow down the beating but lost a point in the process. It didn't matter as Barrios was well ahead and secured the decision and the title.\n10:00 p.m. ET: The condition of Ugas' right eye continues to worsen as we head into the championship rounds. And the way that this fight is going, this could be the beginning of the end for Ugas' career if things don't turn around in the final six minutes.\n9:50 p.m. ET: Things are getting interesting as we head into the ninth round. There is clear damage on Ugas' right eye, the same orbital bone that was broken by Errol Spence Jr. last year. He's fought a decent fight and appeared to have rebounded after the early knockdown but he's going to have to finish strong in order to get a decision here tonight.\n9:26 p.m. ET: Barrios scored a knockdown at the end of round two to make this fight very interesting. Ugas walked into a stiff jab and hit the canvas. Although he wasn't terribly hurt, it'll be interesting to see how his punch resistance holds up over the duration of the fight.\n9:00 p.m. ET: Next is Yordenis Ugas (27-5, 12 KOs) vs. Mario Barrios (27-2, 18 KOs) for the WBC interim super welterweight championship. Ugas is back in action over a year after suffering an eye injury in defeat against Errol Spence Jr. while Barrios will have his third fight at 147 pounds.\nElijah Garcia stops Armando Resendiz in eight\n8:56 p.m. ET: Garcia finished the job in style. Although Resendiz was in the fight, Garcia's power punches were having more of an effect on him in the later rounds. Garcia dropped Resendiz with a body shot and a hook to the head in the eighth round. Garcia then took his time picking his spots as a huge combination forced the hand of referee Tony Weeks at the 1:26 mark to get his 16th victory. The middleweight division could use some new blood and Garcia might be the future of the division.\n8:39 p.m. ET: Through six rounds, Garcia has looked excellent against Resendiz. He's winning the combination exchanges and landing the heavier shots. Resendiz is very game and trying to build momentum off of his upset win over Jarrett Hurd, but the 20-year-old Garcia is proving to be too much for him.\n8:13 p.m. ET: The PPV card is kicking off with the undefeated Elijah Garcia (15-0, 12 KOs) taking on Armando Resendiz (14-1, 10 KOs) in middleweight action.\n7:42 p.m. ET: The early preliminary fights are all wrapped up and we're moments away from the PPV portion of Canelo-Charlo. Early on we had knockouts from Frank Sanchez and Oleksandr Gvozdyk while Terrell Gausha won a majority decision. Scroll down for the early results but stay tuned to our live coverage.\nThe main card starts at 8 p.m. ET | 5 p.m. PT | 1 a.m. BST | 10 a.m. BST | 1 a.m. BST | 10 a.m. AEST.\nCanelo Alvarez vs. Jermell Charlo full card\n\nThis article, authored by Andreas Hale, was published by Sporting News on 2023-09-30 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":245}

{"title":"New ultrathin materials can pull climate-warming CO2 from the air","context":"## New ultrathin materials can pull climate-warming CO2 from the air\n\nThis is another in our series of stories identifying new technologies and actions that can slow climate change, reduce its impacts or help communities cope with a rapidly changing world.\nOne up-and-coming class of tiny materials could help solve the huge problem of climate change. How? By catching climate-warming carbon dioxide out of the air.\nThe nano-scale materials are called MXenes (MAX-eenz). Their name comes from their structure, which is made up of alternating layers of M and X atoms. \u201cM\u201d layers consist of some transition metal. (Those atoms are bulky and can shed a variable number of electrons.) \u201cX\u201d layers contain atoms of another element, such as carbon or nitrogen.\nA single MXene sheet contains a few of these alternating M and X layers chemically bound to each other. It may look like MXM or MXMXM. Each sheet is typically only about 1 nanometer thick. For comparison, a sheet of paper is 100,000 times thicker.\nMXenes normally come as stacks of these individual sheets. The many separate sheets inside a stack add up to a huge overall surface area. It\u2019s like how the combined surface area of all the pages in a book is much larger than that of just the covers.\nIn fact, the total surface area contained in one gram (1\/400 ounce) of MXene \u201ccan cover a football field,\u201d notes Per Persson. He\u2019s a materials scientist at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden.\nAtoms across MXenes\u2019 large surface areas can interact with their environment. That includes grabbing carbon dioxide, or CO 2, out of the air around them \u2014 a process called carbon capture.\nThe white exhaust leaving smokestacks at this coal-fired power plant in Arizona is largely steam. Not visible is the carbon dioxide gas also leaving those stacks. MXene nanomaterials could be installed at or near the top of each stack to collect much of that climate-warming CO 2 before it escapes into the open air. Miguel Sotomayor\/Moment\/Getty Images Plus\nMXenes are excellent at snagging CO 2 , Persson says. Some researchers think it\u2019s because CO 2 molecules are just the right size to fit between a MXene\u2019s tight layers. Persson suspects it\u2019s because CO 2 and MXenes like to share electrons, allowing CO 2 to chemically stick to a MXene\u2019s surface.\nWhat\u2019s more, MXenes chemically ignore other common gases \u2014 such as nitrogen, the most abundant gas in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This could allow MXenes to suck climate-warming CO 2 out of the air while leaving the rest of the atmosphere alone.\nSeveral research groups have been exploring MXenes\u2019 potential to capture CO 2 from the air. In the Link\u00f6ping experiments, \u201cCO 2 stuck to the MXene surface like refrigerator magnets,\u201d Persson says. \u201cIt was absolutely amazing.\u201d His group has shown that MXenes can sponge up as much as half their weight in CO 2 .\nOne large family\nMXenes don\u2019t exist in nature. Scientists have to make them.\nThis is freshly produced MXene, which normally forms a dark powder when dry. This MXene contains alternating layers of vanadium (M) and carbon (X) atoms. Karamullah Eisawi\/Tulane Univ.\nThey do this using other labmade compounds called MAX phases. Like MXenes, MAX phases are layered crystals. But MAX phases have extra sheets of metal \u201cA\u201d that sandwich between their M and X layers.\nTo turn MAX phases into MXenes, scientists must eat away the A layers using a strong acid. A common one is hydrofluoric (Hy-droh-FLOOR-ik) acid. (This acid is so harsh that it can dissolve the minerals in your bones!) The treatment leaves behind just the M and X layers.\nSince the materials\u2019 discovery, scientists have found safer ways to make MXenes. These techniques use milder acids or bases. One such chemical is sodium hydroxide. That\u2019s an ingredient in soap. Another recent method is to use molten fluoride salts to etch away the A layer in MAX phases. No harsh compounds are needed there, although it does take high temps \u2014 up to 750\u00b0 Celsius (1,380\u00b0 Fahrenheit).\nMXenes are the largest group of flat, sheetlike nanomaterials. Scientists refer to them as being largely two-dimensional, or 2-D. Another famous example of a 2-D material is graphene.\nThis diagram depicts a process to convert MAX phase materials into thin sheets of MXenes. An acid etches out all but the M layers (blue) and X layers (purple) to yield thick MXene sheets. The far right panel shows a scanning electron microscope image of the MXene. M. Ozkan et al\/Chem. Oct. 4, 2023 ( CC BY 4.0 DEED\nMXenes have \u201cprobably the largest diversity and tunability any 2-D material can offer,\u201d says Michael Naguib. By tunable, this engineering physicist means that MXenes can be tweaked to take on different properties. Naguib works at Tulane University in New Orleans, La. He made the world\u2019s first MXene in 2011, a titanium carbide.\nScientists have now made more than 50 MXenes. New ones arise when scientists mix and match different M and X atoms. Each MXene has slightly different properties, from how well it conducts electricity to how strong it is.\nScientists can even modify existing MXenes by treating them with different chemicals. This involves covering the MXene\u2019s surface with new atoms, such as oxygen and fluorine, to change its behavior. For more than a decade, scientists have been tailoring different MXenes for use in batteries and other energy storage devices. But tweaking MXenes\u2019 chemistry can also alter their ability to collect CO 2 .\nIn an October 4 paper in Chem, engineers at the University of California, Riverside, reviewed the potential widespread use of MXenes. In a statement, lead author Mihri Ozkan noted, \u201cTheir unique properties make them excellent candidates for capturing CO 2 .\u201d\nPainting on a CO 2 -absorber\nFreshly prepared MXenes appear as a dark-colored powder. Each fleck contains many MXene sheets. Under a microscope, they look like loose sheets of paper. MXenes become easier to work with when scientists add this powder to water, creating an ink, says Anupma Thakur. She\u2019s a materials scientist that Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.\nMihri Ozkan, an engineer at the University of California, Riverside, is the lead author of the new study showing that certain MXenes can act like carbon-dioxide sponges. These nano-scale sheets can sop up that climate-warming gas from the air. UC Riverside\nAs ink, Thakur adds, scientists can simply paint MXenes onto desired surfaces, such as fabric, plastic or glass. Or, if a thick enough coat of MXene paint is peeled carefully off a surface, it can even become a free-standing sheet.\nWhen toughened with polymers, MXene films can durably separate CO 2 from exhaust gas. For carbon capture, Persson imagines fitting MXene filters atop chimneys where the exhaust from burned materials is rich in CO 2 .\nTo absorb CO 2 from the air elsewhere, Thakur suggests putting stacks of MXene screens out in the open. This method would be less efficient at capturing CO 2 , though, since average levels of CO 2 in the air far from pollution sources are quite low.\nKeep in mind, trapping CO 2 anywhere is just a first step in managing this pollutant, says Vitalie Stavila. He\u2019s a materials chemist at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif. \u201cThe problem is, what are you going to do with all that CO 2 ?\u201d he says. Scientists will have to figure out how to retrieve the trapped gas from the MXenes after they\u2019re full.\nMXenes could be heated up to release their CO 2 for long-term storage somewhere else. Flushing MXenes with a different kind of gas, such as hydrogen, might also remove the CO 2 from them. Then the MXenes could be reused for a new round of carbon capture.\nMXenes could also help transform the CO 2 they capture into other useful compounds, Stavila says. That\u2019s because MXenes are catalytic. That means they can help drive other chemicals, such as CO 2 , to react. MXenes also conduct electricity. Since they like sharing electrons with CO 2 , they can ferry those electrons to other compounds.\nAs a result, \u201cyou can do [transformations of CO 2 ] that may not be otherwise possible,\u201d Stavila says. For instance, with a boost from MXenes, CO 2 can react with hydrogen to form methanol or formic acid. These liquids can be used as fuels to reduce people\u2019s reliance on newly mined fossil fuels, which add new CO 2 to the atmosphere. Or, better yet, these liquids can be stored somewhere to keep their carbon out of the air for good.\nThis diagram (cropped for clarity) shows how a dry MXene (upper left) or wet one (lower left) appear to capture and store carbon dioxide molecules (trio of black and red atoms) within its structure (in right version of each MXene). M. Ozkan et al\/Chem. Oct. 4, 2023 ( CC BY 4.0 DEED\nChallenges ahead\nSince they\u2019re still fairly new, MXenes today are only used in research. Scientists have to iron out some kinks before these will be ready for use in the real world. And that will take several years, at least.\nOne weakness of MXenes is that they can break down and transform into other solids called oxides in the presence of oxygen. So water and oxygen make MXenes less reactive. But scientists think they can overcome this problem by tweaking MXenes\u2019 structure. Capping the materials\u2019 edges with bulky salts, for instance, could shield MXenes from damage by oxygen.\nIt\u2019s also hard, right now, to make large amounts of MXenes. In the lab, researchers can make only several kilograms (pounds) in a single batch. Several companies are working out how to boost batch sizes.\nBut Thakur points out one irony: Making MXenes for carbon capture can have a big carbon footprint. It takes a lot of electricity to get the heat needed to make them, she notes. Much of that electricity is made using CO 2 -spewing fossil fuels. It\u2019s important to make sure that the energy used to make these materials doesn\u2019t spew more CO 2 than the MXenes can later sop up. Otherwise, that would defeat their use in carbon capture.\nEducators and Parents, Sign Up for The Cheat Sheet Weekly updates to help you use Science News Explores in the learning environment Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\nMXenes also cost a lot to make. The high cost of making these materials would be less important if they could withstand thousands of CO 2 capture-and-release cycles. That way, scientists wouldn\u2019t have to keep making new MXenes.\nSo far, no one has tested MXenes\u2019 durability for stored CO 2 removal and reuse. Still, it helps that MXenes are mechanically rugged. Research has shown that certain types can be as strong as steel.\nThe Riverside group\u2019s new paper also points to a related family of nanosheets that may prove good CO 2 sponges. Made from MXenes, they\u2019re known as MBenes, because the \u201cX\u201d layer is made up of boron atoms. These materials are harder to make than MXenes. So most research on them has been done with math or computer models. But MBenes could have unique mechanical and electrical traits, Ozkan\u2019s team finds. And those just might help them last through many, many cycles of CO 2 capture and release.\nEach year, human activities spew tens of billions of tons of CO 2 into the air. That\u2019s equivalent to the weight of tens of billions of elephants. Carbon absorbers, including MXenes or MBenes, can\u2019t catch it all. As such, they\u2019re never going to replace the need for reducing emissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases.\nStill, given the urgency of climate change, even a quick or partial fix \u2014 such as carbon capture \u2014 can\u2019t be ignored. \u201cAt this point in time,\u201d says Persson, \u201cwe need to look at all the possible solutions.\u201d And MXene-like materials are emerging as potentially important candidates.\n\nThis article, authored by Shi En Kim, was published by Science News For Students on 2023-12-15 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":247}
{"title":"Deepfake election risks trigger EU call for more generative AI safeguards","context":"## Deepfake election risks trigger EU call for more generative AI safeguards\n\nThe European Union has warned more needs to be done to address the risks that widely accessible generative AI tools may pose to free and fair debate in democratic societies, with the bloc\u2019s values and transparency commissioner highlighting AI-generated disinformation as a potential threat to elections ahead of the pan-EU vote to choose a new European Parliament next year.\nGiving an update on the the bloc\u2019s voluntary Code of Practice on Disinformation in a speech today, Vera Jourova welcomed initial efforts by a number of mainstream platforms to address the AI risks by implementing safeguards to inform users about the \u201csynthetic origin of content posted online\u201d, as she put it. But said more must be done.\n\u201cThese efforts need to continue and intensify considering the high potential of such realistic AI products for creating and disseminating disinformation. The risks are particularly high in the context of elections,\u201d she warned. \u201cI therefore urge platforms to be vigilant and provide efficient safeguards for this in the context of elections.\u201d\nThe EU commissioner noted she\u2019s meeting representatives of ChatGPT maker, OpenAI, later today to discuss the issue.\nThe AI giant is not a signatory to the bloc\u2019s anti-disinformation Code \u2014 as yet \u2014 so is likely to be facing pressure to get on board with the effort. (We\u2019ve reached out to OpenAI with questions about its meeting with the Jourova.)\nThe commissioner\u2019s remarks today on generative AI follow initial pressure applied to platforms this summer, when she urged signatories to label deepfakes and other AI-generated content \u2014 calling on Code signatories to create a dedicated and separate track to tackle \u201cAI production\u201d, and quipping that machines should not have free speech.\nAn incoming pan-EU AI regulation (aka, the EU AI Act) is expected to make user disclosures a legal requirement on makers of generative AI technologies like AI chatbots. Although the still draft legislation remains the subject of negotiations by EU co-legislators. Add to that, once adopted the law is not expected to apply for a couple of years so the Commission has turned to the Code to act as a stop-gap vehicle to encourage signatories to be proactive about deepfake disclosures it expects to be mandatory in the future.\nFollowing efforts to beef up the anti-disinformation Code last year the Commission also made it clear it would treat adherence to the non-legally binding Code as a favorable signal for compliance with (hard legal) requirements hitting larger platforms which are subject to the Digital Services Act (DSA) \u2014 another major piece of pan-EU digital regulation that obliges so called very-large-online-platforms (VLOPs) and search engines (VLOSEs) to assess and mitigate societal risks attached to their algorithms (such as disinformation).\n\u201cUpcoming national elections and the EU elections will be an important test for the Code that platforms signatories should not fail,\u201d said Jourova today, warning: \u201cPlatforms will need to take their responsibility seriously, in particular in view of the DSA that requires them to mitigate the risks they pose for elections.\n\u201cThe DSA is now binding, and all the VLOPs have to comply with it. The Code underpins the DSA, because our intention is to transform the Code of Practice into a Code of Conduct that can form part of a co-regulatory framework for addressing risks of disinformation.\u201d\nA second batch of reports by disinformation Code signatories have been published today, covering the January to June period. At the time of writing only a handful are available for download on the EU\u2019s Disinformation Code Transparency Center \u2014 including reports from Google, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok.\nThe EU said these are the most extensive reports produced by signatories to the Code since it was set up back in 2018.\nThe EU\u2019s voluntary anti-disinformation Code has 44 signatories in all \u2014 covering not just major social media and search platforms such as the aforementioned giants but entities from across the ad industry and civil society organizations involved in fact-checking.\nGoogle\nOn generative AI, Google\u2019s report discusses \u201crecent progress in large-scale AI models\u201d which it suggests has \u201csparked additional discussion about the social impacts of AI and raised concerns on topics such as misinformation\u201d. The tech giant is an early adopter of generative AI in search \u2014 via its Bard chatbot.\n\u201cGoogle is committed to developing technology responsibly and has published AI Principles to guide our work, including application areas we will not pursue,\u201d it writes in summary on the topic, adding: \u201cWe have also established a governance team to put them into action by conducting ethical reviews of new systems, avoiding bias and incorporating privacy, security and safety.\n\u201cGoogle Search has published guidance on AI-generated content, outlining its approach to maintaining a high standard of information quality and the overall helpfulness of content on Search. To help address misinformation, Google has also announced that it will soon be integrating new innovations in watermarking, metadata, and other techniques into its latest generative models.\n\u201cGoogle also recently joined other leading AI companies to jointly commit to advancing responsible practices in the development of artificial intelligence which will support efforts by the G7, the OECD, and national governments. Going forward we will continue to report and expand upon Google developed AI tools and are committed to advance bold and responsible AI, to maximise AI\u2019s benefits and minimise its risks.\u201d\nOver the next six months Google\u2019s report states it has no additional measures planned for YouTube. But, with generative image capabilities rolling out internally over the next year, it commits Google Search to leveraging IPTC Photo Metadata Standard to add metadata tags to images that are generated by Google AI.\n\u201cCreators and publishers will be able to add a similar markup to their own images, so a label can be displayed in Search to indicate the images as AI generated,\u201d Google\u2019s report further notes.\nMicrosoft\nMicrosoft \u2014 a major investor in OpenAI which has also baked generative AI capabilities into its own search engine \u2014 claims it\u2019s taking \u201ca cross product whole of company approach to ensure the responsible implementation of AI\u201d.\nIts report flags its \u201cResponsible AI Principles\u201d which it says it\u2019s developed into a Responsible AI standard v.2 and Information Integrity Principles \u201cto help set baseline standards and guidance across product teams\u201d.\n\u201cRecognizing that there is an important role for government, academia and civil society to play in the responsible deployment of AI, we also created a roadmap for the governance of AI across the world as well as creating a vision for the responsible advancement of AI, both inside Microsoft and throughout the world, including specifically in Europe,\u201d Microsoft goes on, committing to continue building on efforts \u2014 including by developing new tools (such as Project Providence with Truepic) and inking partnerships (examples it gives include the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), to combat the rise of manipulated or AI created media; with EFE Verifica to track false narratives spreading in Spain, Latin America, and Spanish speaking populations; and Reporters Sans Frontie\u0300res to use their Journalism Trust Initiative dataset in Microsoft products).\n\u201cThese partnerships are part of a larger effort to empower Microsoft users to better understand the information they consume across our platforms and products,\u201d it suggests, also citing efforts undertaken in media literacy campaigns and \u201ccyber-skilling\u201d which it says are \u201cnot designed to tell individuals what to believe or how to think; rather, they are about equipping people to think critically and make informed decisions about what information they consume\u201d.\nOn Bing Search, where Microsoft was quick to embed generative AI features \u2014 leading to some embarrassing early reviews which demonstrated the tool producing dubious content \u2014 the report claims it has taken a raft of measures to mitigate risks including applying its AI principles during development and consulting with experts; engaging in pre-launch testing and a limited preview period and phased release; the use of classifiers and metaprompting, defensive search interventions, enhanced reporting functionality, and increased operations and incident response; as well as updating Bing\u2019s terms of use to include a Code of Conduct for users.\nThe report also claims Microsoft has set up a \u201crobust user reporting and appeal process to review and respond to user concerns of harmful or misleading content\u201d.\nOver the next six months, the report does not commit Bing Search to any specific additional steps to address risk attached to the use of generative AI \u2014 Microsoft just says it\u2019s keeping a watching brief, writing: \u201cBing is regularly reviewing and evaluating its policies and practices related to existing and new Bing features and adjusts and updates policies as needed.\u201d\nTikTok\nIn its report, TikTok focuses on AI-generated content in the context of ensuring the \u201cintegrity\u201d of its services \u2014 flagging a recent update to its community guidelines which also saw it modify its synthetic media policy \u201cto address the use of content created or modified by AI technology on our platform\u201d.\n\u201cWhile we welcome the creativity that new AI may unlock, in line with our updated policy, users must proactively disclose when their content is AI-generated or manipulated but shows realistic scenes,\u201d it also writes. \u201cWe continue to fight against covert influence operations (CIO) and we do not allow attempts to sway public opinion while misleading our platform\u2019s systems or community about the identity, origin, operating location, popularity, or purpose of the account.\u201d\n\u201cCIOs continue to evolve in response to our detection and networks may attempt to reestablish a presence on our platform. This is why we continue to iteratively research and evaluate complex deceptive behaviours and develop appropriate product and policy solutions. We continue to provide information about the CIO networks we identify and remove in this report and within our transparency reports here,\u201d it adds.\nCommitment 15 in TikTok\u2019s report signs the platform up to \u201ctak[ing] into consideration transparency obligations and the list of manipulative practices prohibited under the proposal for Artificial Intelligence Act\u201d \u2014 and here it lists being a launch partner of the Partnership on AI\u2019s (PAI) \u201cResponsible Practices for Synthetic Media\u201d (and contributing to the development of \u201crelevant practices\u201d); and joining \u201cnew relevant groups\u201d, such as the Generative AI working group which started work this month as implemented measures towards this pledge.\nIn the next six months it says it wants to further strengthen its enforcement of its synthetic media policy \u2014 and explore \u201cnew products and initiatives to help enhance our detection and enforcement capabilities\u201d in this area, including in the area of user education.\nMeta\nFacebook and Instagram parent Meta\u2019s report also includes a recognition that \u201cwidespread availability and adoption of generative AI tools may have implications for how we identify, and address disinformation on our platforms\u201d.\n\u201cWe want to work with partners in government, industry, civil society and academia to ensure that we can develop robust, sustainable solutions to tackling AI-generated misinformation,\u201d Meta goes on, also noting it has signed up to the PAI\u2019s Responsible Practices for Synthetic Media, while professing the company to be \u201ccommitted to cross-industry collaboration to help to maintain the integrity of the online information environment for our users\u201d.\n\u201cBesides, to bring more people into this process, we are launching a Community Forum on Generative AI aimed at producing feedback on the principles people want to see reflected in new AI technologies,\u201d Meta adds. \u201cIt will be held in consultation with Stanford Deliberative Democracy Lab and the Behavioural Insights Team, and is consistent with our open collaboration approach to sharing AI models. We look forward to expanding this effort as a member of the Code\u2019s Task Force Working Group on Generative AI, and look forward to working together with its other members.\u201d\nOver the next six months, Meta says it wants to \u201cwork with partners in government, industry, civil society and academia in Europe and around the world, to ensure that we can develop robust, sustainable solutions to tackling AI-generated misinformation\u201d, adding: \u201cWe will participate in the newly formed working group on AI-generated disinformation under the EU Code of Practice.\u201d\nKremlin propaganda\nPlatforms must concentrate efforts to combat the spread of Kremlin propaganda, Jourova also warned today \u2014 including in the context of looming EU elections next year with the risk of Russia stepping up its election interference efforts.\n\u201cOne of my main messages to the signatories is to be aware of the context. Russian war against Ukraine, and the upcoming EU elections next year, are particularly relevant, because the risk of disinformation is particularly serious,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Russian state has engaged in the war of ideas to pollute our information space with half-truth and lies to create a false image that democracy is no better than autocracy.\n\u201cToday, this is a multi-million euro weapon of mass manipulation aimed both internally at the Russians as well as at Europeans and the rest of the world. We must address this risk. The very large platforms must address this risk. Especially that we have to expect that the Kremlin and others will be active before elections. I expect signatories to adjust their actions to reflect that there is a war in the information space waged against us and that there are upcoming elections where malicious actors will try to use the design features of the platforms to manipulate.\u201d\nPer the Commission\u2019s early analysis of Big Tech\u2019s Code reports, YouTube shut down more than 400 channels between January and April 2023 which were involved in coordinated influence operations linked to the Russian-state sponsored Internet Research Agency (IRA). It also removed ads from almost 300 sites linked to state-funded propaganda sites.\nWhile the EU highlighted that TikTok\u2019s fact-checking efforts now cover Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian and 17 European languages, including through a new partnership with Reuters. \u201cIn this context, 832 videos related to the war have been fact-checked, of which 211 have been removed,\u201d Jourova noted.\nThe EU also flagged reporting by Microsoft that told it Bing Search had either promoted information or downgraded questionable information in relation to almost 800,000 search queries related to the Ukraine crisis.\nJourova\u2019s speech also highlighted a couple of other areas where she urged Code signatories to go further \u2014 calling (yet again) for more consistent moderation and investment in fact-checking, especially in smaller Member States and languages.\nShe also criticized platforms over access to data, saying they must step up efforts to make sure researchers are empowered to scrutinize disinformation flows \u201cand contribute to the necessary transparency\u201d.\nBoth are areas where X\/Twitter under new owner, Elon Musk, has moved out of step with EU expectations on countering disinformation.\nTwitter (now X) was an original signatory to the disinformation Code but Musk took the platform out of the initiative back in May, as critical scrutiny of his actions dialled up in the EU. And also today, as we reported earlier, Jourova drew attention to early analysis conducted by some of the remaining signatories which she said had found X performed the worst for disinformation ratios.\nThis suggests that X, which back in April was designated by the EU as a VLOP under the DSA, continues to put itself squarely in the Commission\u2019s crosshairs \u2014 including over its priority issue of tackling Kremlin propaganda.\nAs well as devising the anti-disinformation Code, the bloc\u2019s executive is now responsible for oversight of VLOPs\u2019 compliance with the DSA \u2014 with powers under the new law to fine violators up to 6% of global annual turnover.\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-09-26 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":248}
{"title":"Gio Reyna looks good in start for USMNT vs. Germany, but those involved in the finish are punished in 3-1 defeat","context":"## Gio Reyna looks good in start for USMNT vs. Germany, but those involved in the finish are punished in 3-1 defeat\n\nGio Reyna looked sharp in the starting lineup for the United States men\u2019s national team, in all the ways a young man can: his unyielding energy, his surprising eagerness to cover the whole of the midfield, the periodic flashes of skill when the opportunity presented itself, even the bleach-blond hair that allowed viewers to spot him in an instant.\nThere was one substantial element missing from his performance, though, in an immense friendly Saturday against Germany: being able to endure from starting to finishing.\nIt was kind of like that for the USMNT as a whole, as they blew an early lead and fell, 3-1, in East Hartford, Conn.\nMORE: USMNT undone by errors in loss to Germany\nIt is quite possible this was the most challenging friendly the U.S. are likely to play between now and the 2026 World Cup here in North America, and so it was viewed by coach Gregg Berhalter as a significant opportunity to learn about his team. And what was learned, above all, was there needs to be an alternative approach to the midfield for whenever Tyler Adams is unavailable to play.\nAdams is the one proven defensive midfielder \u2014 a No. 6, as they call it in soccer jargon \u2014 on the USMNT roster. He has been absent from the national team since injuring his hamstring in the spring, and it\u2019s possible now he\u2019ll need a second surgery to address the issue.\nThe decision about how to replace him in the lineup was rather simple. It always was the plan for Reyna to play roughly half this game, and the obvious choice in that circumstance, given the sometimes ridiculous controversy that developed from Reyna\u2019s reserve role at the World Cup, was to have him start. The decision about how to replace Adams in the formation was complex \u2014 too much so to be resolved in one afternoon.\nReyna was exceptional throughout the first half: less influential than he might have been if given greater access to the ball but evincing a welcome taste for covering ground to become helpful on defense or to retrieve the ball and launch an attack. Weston McKennie was his typical self, particularly when he could connect with star winger Christian Pulisic along the left side.\nYoung Yunus Musah was deployed in the defensive midfield role, and it did not work. Whenever Germany were able to quell an American surge in the first half and regain possession, they plowed with ease through through the center of the park. He is elite at maintaining possession when operating as a box-to-box midfielder, and lately his club play, with Pulisic at AC Milan, has seen Musah in more of an attacking role. Even if one can argue he has the skill set to succeed at the No. 6, he did not appear comfortable transitioning on short notice.\nMORE: USA vs. Germany player ratings\n\u201cTyler\u2019s a great player. It\u2019s not nice to talk about guys that aren't here, though,\u201d Berhalter told reporters afterward. \u201cI\u2019d rather talk about the guys that are on the field.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t, though, relative to how this group filled Adams\u2019 huge vacancy. He was pleased to talk about the pressure the USMNT applied in the first half, including a ball played over the top of Germany\u2019s defense to Pulisic early in the game that was stopped by an offside call both player and coach disputed, and Pulisic\u2019s brilliant goal in the 27th minute that involved him driving to his right and blasting a curving shot while four defenders converged and ace goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen watched it sail into the upper righthand corner.\n.@pulisic with a SCREAMER to open the scoring \ud83d\ude31 pic.twitter.com\/KlG0oMeNPm \u2014 U.S. Men's National Soccer Team (@USMNT) October 14, 2023\n\u201cI think we created some problems,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cAnd then just the threat we had a lot in the first half was really good. It put Germany on their heels at times. But to me, it\u2019s also about controlling the tempo of the game, and that\u2019s what we really need to learn.\u201d\nIt was a victory of sorts for Reyna to play 45 minutes after he\u2019d gone only 27 in his one club appearance this season for Borussia Dortmund. He\u2019d been injured in June while playing for the U.S. and missed all of preseason training and nearly two months of the Bundesliga season.\n\u201cThe goal is to send him back to Dortmund in a really good spot,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cI think he played a good game, showed his quality. I think everyone in the first half played well. So it was good to see him, good to have him on the field.\u201d\nIt was not good to not have him on the field, because the collapse from a 1-1 halftime tie not only followed Reyna\u2019s departure, but probably was connected. The U.S. was able to threaten the opposing goal enough with Reyna on the field to cause the opposition to concern itself with defending more often than it preferred. Replacement Luca de la Torre dulled the attack and did nothing to dissuade Germany\u2019s rampage toward the American net.\nThere was plenty of blame to be shared on the goals by Niclas Fullkrug in the 58th minute and Jamal Musiala three minutes later. Sergino Dest allowed the ball to deflect off his foot and into dangerous territory at the top of the box, de la Torre became a spectator with a too-great view and central defender Chris Richards missed two opportunities to shut down the threat. McKennie, central defender Tim Ream and right back Joe Scally all bore some responsibility for the second.\n\u201cWhen you watch the goals back \u2014 I had the opportunity to do that in the coaches\u2019 office \u2014 it\u2019s really these fine moments, these split seconds where you need to be well-positioned, not open up any gaps in your back line,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where it went wrong.\u201d\nWith the attempt to transform Musah into some semblance of Adams, though, it almost was certain to go wrong. The USMNT conjured a more compelling attack because of Reyna\u2019s presence, but the ability to control the game went missing.\nSo many national team fans sided with Reyna during the controversy that developed as the team competed at last winter's World Cup. They got what they argued for in this game, but not what they wished.\n\nThis article, authored by Mike DeCourcy, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-14 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":249}

Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nHere are the best Prime Day deals we could find gathered in one place.\nAmazon's second Prime Day-like sale event for 2023 kicked off in the wee hours this morning, and it's turning out to be a great opportunity to get holiday shopping done early. Or, if you missed out on any of the deals from Prime Day in July, this year's \"Prime Big Deal Days\" will let you make up for that. The sale has brought back many of the same steep discounts we saw during the summer as well as new sales. We've also put together category roundups for deals on headphones, tablets, TVs, video games and other gadgets. If you've got your gift list handy, now's a good time to start checking it off so you won't be pressed for time or funds when Black Friday and Cyber Monday come around next month. A few deals are just for Prime members, but many are open to anyone looking to save. If you want to take advantage of some great tech deals, here are all of the best deals we found for October Prime Day.\nApple AirPods Pro\nThe second-generation AirPods Pro have dropped to $189 for Prime Day. Apple made a ton of small but noticeable improvements to these models, so now they have better sound quality, noise cancelation and Transparency Mode. There remains no competition if you have an iPhone and live within the Apple ecosystem \u2014 these are the best earbuds to get if you fall into that category.\nApple Watch SE\nThe Apple Watch SE is on sale for $199 right now. It's the best smartwatch to get if you're new to the wearable world, or you just want a basic, relatively affordable watch that has all of the basic features you'd need. On top of comprehensive health and fitness tracking, iPhone notifications and dozens of fun watch faces, you'll get features like crash and fall detection, noise monitoring and Emergency SOS.\nApple 10.2-inch iPad\nApple's most affordable tablet, the 10.2-inch iPad, is on sale for $249 right now. It may have an old-school design, but it's certainly the best iPad for people on a budget and it has most crucial features you'd expect in an Apple tablet. It earned a score of 86 from us for its solid performance, sharp screen, TouchID-capable Home button and good battery life. The only major downside to this model right now is that it still sports Apple's old Lightning port rather than USB-C.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\nThe new Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is down to $270 for October Prime Day, which is the lowest price we've seen since it came out a few months ago. You can't get a better smartwatch than this one if you have an Android phone (bonus points if you have a Samsung phone), and it's smaller and lighter than previous versions. Samsung brought back the spinning bezel on the Classic version, which is which makes the software's UI easier to navigate, plus it has improved performance and updated health and fitness tracking tools.\nApple iPad mini\nThe Apple iPad mini has dropped to $400 for October Prime Day. It's the best small tablet on the market right now and really your only option if you want a true one-hand-friendly iPad. It's powered by Apple's A15 Bionic chip and sports a Touch ID-toting power button, solid cameras, a good battery life and a USB-C port for charging.\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony's WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are on sale for $278 for Prime Day, which is their best price yet. These are the best wireless earbuds on the market right now, and Sony improved upon it's already remarkable buds with a more comfortable fit, better sound quality and features likes adaptive sound and Speak-to-Chat.\nAnker Soundcore Space A40\nThe Anker Soundcore Space A40 is on sale for $54, which matches its all-time low and comes in $25 less than usual. The Space A40 is the top pick in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds, as it includes a host of features that belie its price: adaptive ANC, multi-device pairing, wireless charging, a transparency mode and up to 10 hours of battery life. Its audio quality and ANC aren\u2019t quite as powerful as more expensive pairs, but both are more than effective enough for the money. Unlike many budget wireless headphones, its default sound doesn\u2019t completely blow out the bass. Just note that its call quality is mediocre, and it lacks wear detection, so it won\u2019t auto-pause when you remove an earbud.\nBose QuietComfort 45\nThe Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones have dropped to $230 for October Prime Day, which is about $80 cheaper than their usual selling price. These cans earned a spot in our best wireless headphone guide thanks to their comfortable, if a little dated, design, excellent ANC and balanced audio.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro have dropped to $120 for Prime Day. The company got a lot of things right after years of making pretty standard earbuds; the Pixel Buds Pro are Google's best wireless earbuds yet. These will be great for Android users who want buds with punchy bass, good ANC, reliable touch controls and wireless charging.\nAmazon Echo Dot\nAmazon has knocked the price of the latest Echo Dot down to $23 right now. It\u2019s one of the best smart speakers you can get thanks to its orb-like design, surprisingly good sound quality for its size and handy Alexa integration. The Dots can also act as Eero WiFi boosters, adding up to 1,000 square feet of coverage to your existing Eero system.\nAmazon Echo Show 5\nThe latest Echo Show 5 is on sale for a record low of $40. The Show 5 has been one of the best smart displays available for quite some time, and it\u2019ll be particularly good for anyone who wants an Alexa-capable smart display that won\u2019t take up a lot of space. It also makes for a good alarm clock thanks to its sunrise alarm and tap-to-snooze features.\nAmazon Kindle\nThe standard Kindle has dropped to $75 for October Prime Day. This model saw a lot of improvements when it was updated in 2022. Capacity was doubled to 16GB and the screen resolution jumped up to 300 ppi for much clearer text. We named it the best budget option in our ereader guide because its perfect entry point to reading and borrowing ebooks and audiobooks.\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite\nThe Kindle Paperwhite, meanwhile, is down to $95 for an 8GB model. That's $5 more than it went for during July's Prime Day event but still $45 off its MSRP. The Paperwhite gets you a few extra perks over the standard Kindle, including a larger 6.8-inch screen, a more comprehensive front light and IPX8-rated waterproofing. This deal applies to the ad-supported version (which displays ads for Kindle books and services on your lock screen); it you want no ads on your device, you\u2019ll need to pay $20 more.\n$100 PlayStation Store Gift Card + $10 Amazon credit\nHere's a simple one: If you buy a $100 PlayStation Store digital gift card and use the code PSN100 at checkout, you can get an extra $10 Amazon credit to use on future purchases. If you often use Amazon and plan on picking up new PS5 games, renewing a PlayStation Plus subscription or buying any other content through the PlayStation Store anyway, it's effectively a bit of free money.\nBlink Mini (2-pack)\nA two-pack of Blink Mini security cameras has dropped to $40 for Prime Day. That's about $10 more than they went for last Prime Day, but still a decent 38 percent discount. While these cameras are wired, they have most of the same features as the standard wireless Blink cameras including 1080p video recordings and support for two-way talk and motion alerts.\nGoogle Indoor Nest Security Cam\nA slew of Google Nest home security devices are on sale, including the battery-powered Nest Cam that can go inside or outside your home. Typically priced at $180, the security cam is down to $120 for Amazon's October Prime Day event. The Nest Cam works with smart speakers and displays enabled with Alexa or the Google Assistant and can last up to seven months depending on how much activity it picks up. Its weather-resistant build and magnetic mount should make it easy to install on most surfaces. It sends live alerts to your phone and will even allow for on-demand check-ins without a subscription, though it only stores the last three hours for free. For six months of stored footage, you'll need a Nest Aware membership.\nAmazon Fire HD 8\nAmazon\u2019s Fire HD 8 is down to $60 for the Prime Big Deal Days event, which is $5 more than the tablet\u2019s all-time low but still $40 off its list price. This discount applies to the model with 32GB of storage; if you need more space, the 64GB version is on sale for $75. Either way, the Fire HD 8 is likely the cheapest competent tablet for most people: It\u2019s slower than the Fire HD 10 and its display is limited to a 1,280 x 800 resolution, but it\u2019s lightweight, it can last more than 10 hours on a charge and it\u2019s still quick enough for basic streaming and reading. It\u2019s not the best value at its standard going rate, but for $60, it\u2019s hard to do better.\nAmazon Fire 11 Max\nThe Fire Max 11 is Amazon\u2019s largest and most performant tablet, with an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 resolution display, an aluminum frame, a respectable octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM. It has the same software limitations and lock-screen ads as any other Fire slate, so it\u2019s a tough sell at its usual $230, but now it\u2019s on sale for $150, which matches its all-time low. If you already use a bunch of Amazon services and don\u2019t want to shell out for an entry-level iPad, it's a big upgrade over the Fire HD 8 \u2014 just don\u2019t expect to get any real work done with it.\nGoogle Pixel Tablet\nPhoto by Cherlynn Low \/ Engadget Google Pixel Tablet $409 $499 Save $90 The 11-inch Pixel Tablet comes with a charging speaker dock that allows it to double as a smart home hub. This deal marks a new all-time low. $409 at Amazon\nThe 128GB Google Pixel Tablet is down to $409, which is $90 off and a new low. The 256GB model is also on sale for $509. While we think Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab S9 works better purely as a tablet, Google\u2019s 11-inch slate still gets you a sharp LCD display, a speedy Tensor G2 chip and an easy-to-hold design that weighs just over a pound. Its big hook, however, is that it can attach to an included charging speaker dock and double as a Nest Hub Max-style smart display. Android still isn\u2019t as optimized for large screens as iPadOS, but if that extra functionality sounds useful to you, the Pixel Tablet is worth a look. We gave it a score of 85 in June. (The Galaxy Tab S9, meanwhile, isn\u2019t on sale as of this writing.)\nGoogle Pixel 7a\nThe Google Pixel 7a is down to a new low of $399 for this sale event. It's the best midrange phone you can get right now thanks to its speedy Tensor G2 chip, smooth 90Hz display and support for wireless charging. The 7a also has solid cameras and an IP67 water-resistant design.\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\nThe entire Samsung Galaxy S23 series is on sale for Prime Day, including the S23, S23+ and S23 Ultra. These are some of the best Android phones you can buy right now, and we recommend springing for the S23 Ultra if you want all of the latest features from Samsung. The Ultra runs on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and has a big, bold 120Hz display, built-in S Pen and an excellent main camera.\nBose Quiet Comfort\nThe Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II have dropped to $199 for October Prime Day, which is the best price we've ever seen, though you'll need to be a Prime member to get the deal. They're currently the best wireless earbuds you can get if you want as much noise cancelation as possible. On top of that, these buds have a smaller, more comfortable fit and good audio quality.\nSony SRS-XB13 Extra Bass\nThe four-inch tall SRS-XB13 is back to $35 for October Prime, which matches its sale price for July\u2019s Prime sale. You'll need a Prime membership to get the deal, however. This is an older model of the tiny portable. Sony replaced it with the SRS-XB100 earlier this year, which is currently seeing a 20 percent discount. They're both rated for water and dust resistance and you can pair two for stereo sound.\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K\nOur favorite streaming stick, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K, has dropped to $38 for this sale. It packs a ton of features into an affordable package, including 4K HDR streaming capabilities, Dolby Vision, AirPlay 2 and private listening when you have a pair of headphones. And since it's so small, it makes a great travel entertainment device, too.\nLG B2\nThe LG B2 OLED TV is down to $847 for a 55-inch model. That\u2019s a new low and roughly $150 off its average street price in recent months. The B2 is the step-down model from the C2 \u2014 which is also on sale at $1,097 for a 55-inch set \u2014 as it\u2019s not as bright or color-rich with HDR content, it runs on a slower processor and it has two fewer HDMI 2.1 ports. That said, its contrast, colors and motion performance will still be a significant upgrade if you\u2019re upgrading from a more basic LED TV. LG\u2019s new B3 TV promises a cleaner webOS interface, but it\u2019s priced a good way higher as of this writing. If you want an OLED TV for less than $1,000, the B2 should be a better value.\nHisense U6K\nIf you want a more affordable TV, the Hisense U6K is also on sale, with the 55- and 65-inch models down to $400 and $548, respectively. We\u2019ve seen these deals before, but each matches an all-time low. The U6K is has received generally positive reviews around the web, as it's one of the few budget-level sets with quantum dots, full-array local dimming and a mini-LED backlight. All of that should help it deliver better contrast and color volume than most TVs in its price range. It\u2019s not ideal for gaming though, as it\u2019s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate and lacks HDMI 2.1 ports. In general, it can\u2019t match the brightness or viewing angles of a more expensive set, but it looks to be a good buy if you\u2019re on a tighter budget.\nFor a well-reviewed mid-range model, the Hisense U8K provides much better contrast and peak brightness, and it comes with more gaming-friendly features like the ability to play 4K content at up to a 144Hz refresh rate. That one is down to $748 for a 55-inch model and $998 for a 65-inch set.\niRobot Roomba 694\niRobot's Roomba 694 has dropped to $199 for Prime Day. It's our favorite cheap robot vacuum thanks to its strong suction power, attractive design and easy to use app. It'll be a good option for robo-vac novices, or anyone that doesn't want to fuss too much with an automatic dirt sucker. It clears hard and carpeted floors well, and it automatically returns to its base once a cleaning job is finished so it can recharge.\nRazer Basilisk V3\nThe Razer Basilisk V3 is down to $44, which is a few bucks more than its all-time low but still $6 less than its usual street price. This is the \u201cbest for most\u201d pick in our guide to the best gaming mouse, as its sturdy shape should be comfortable for each grip type and all but the smallest hands. (Provided you\u2019re a righty.) It has 11 customizable buttons, including a \u201csensitivity clutch\u201d for more precise aiming, and its thumb wheel supports both left-right tilt and a faster free-spin mode. That wheel is somewhat noisy, and the whole thing is too heavy for competitive-minded players, but it still tracks accurately and glides smoothly.\nSamsung Pro Plus microSD\nThe Samsung Pro Plus microSD card is on sale for $20 right now. It's our top pick in our best microSD card guide because it was the most consistent of the ones we tested, with some of the best overall speeds and all of the important ratings that a good card should have: U3, V30 and A2. It'll be a great pick for your tablet, smartphone or Nintendo Switch, and it comes with a full-sized adapter in case you need to use it with a camera or connect it to your computer.\nBackbone One\nThe Backbone One is a well-built gamepad that snaps around the sides of your phone and works immediately with just about any game that supports controller input. It\u2019s also convenient for cloud streaming games from a console or PC. Right now both its USB-C and Lightning models are down to $70, which is $30 off. That\u2019s not an all-time low, but discounts on the device are relatively uncommon. We gave the One a positive review last year, and we currently highlight it in our guide to the best handheld gaming systems. Backbone says the USB-C models will work with Apple\u2019s new iPhone 15 lineup as well.\nCrucial MX500\nThe Crucial MX500 internal drive is on sale for $46 right now. It's been an Engadget favorite for a while thanks to its sequential read speeds of 560MB\/s and a standard 2.5-inch design that should make it easy to swap in for your desktop's or laptop's used-up drive.\nYour October Prime Day Shopping Guide: See all of our Prime Day coverage.

{"title":"26-year-old with $145,000 in student debt can't afford Christmas. She's giving 'affordable gifts or combining gifts with my older sister'","context":"## 26-year-old with $145,000 in student debt can't afford Christmas. She's giving 'affordable gifts or combining gifts with my older sister'\n\nFor Nicole Plauch\u00e9 and her family, Christmas is the time of the year where they can use their preferred love language: gift giving. This year, however, Plauch\u00e9 is worried about how much she can afford to spend on gifts. Her main struggle? Student loan payments.\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t leave much room for anything outside of just basic necessities,\u201d said Plauch\u00e9, a 23-year old tech sales manager from Dallas, Texas.\nMarisa Johnson, 26, has approximately $145,000 in student loan debt from both her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. Since the COVID-era payment pause ended in October, she\u2019s been paying back $300 a month while she waits to see if she\u2019ll be enrolled in a new income-driven repayment plan.\nBecause all of her money is going to necessities and paying back her student loans, Johnson hasn\u2019t been able to spend as much on gifts as in previous years.\n\u201cI\u2019ve mostly been trying to think of affordable gifts or combining gifts with my older sister,\u201d said Johnson, a non-profit worker in Citrus Heights, California.\nPlauch\u00e9 and Johnson are just two of the millions of people who had to start paying back student loans after the Biden administration ended the three-year payment pause.\n\u201cWe know that the holidays are often a very joyful time of the year and an expensive one every year,\u201d said Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma. \u201cWith federal student loan payments just resuming, it\u2019s going to add another often very significant line item into holiday budgets.\u201d\nIf student loan payments are cutting into what used to be your holiday budget, here are some recommendations:\nTHE PRESSURE IS REAL\nFrom family expectations to social media and TV ads showing lavish gifts, many people feel that the only way they can show love is to spend a lot of money.\nBetween being a mom and a new grad with a salary to match, Plauch\u00e9 says she can barely manage her daily expenses. Still, she feels a responsibility to give her family gifts because that\u2019s how they have traditionally shown each other love.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to give my family this message that they\u2019re not loved and it definitely adds a lot of pressure,\u201d she said.\nJohnson feels guilty because the holidays are the time she feels she can show her family how grateful she is for them. She has always prided herself on being a great gift giver who not only finds something nice but knows how to spot unique and special gifts.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a little embarrassed to tell them that this year I might not be able to be a good gift giver,\u201d said Johnson.\nAcknowledging that you\u2019re feeling pressure is a good first step towards making a plan to set expectations and be realistic about what you can spend.\nBUDGET\nAlev is a big proponent of the 50-30-20 budgeting method, where 50% of your income is allocated for necessities like food and rent, 30% for things you want, and 20% for savings and debt repayment.\nTo find space in your budget for gifts, Alev recommends that you plan ahead as much as possible and only take money from the 30% portion of your budget.\nIf the 50-30-20 is not the right format for you, there are plenty of other budgeting methods that you can use. Whether is recording your spending on an Excel spreadsheet, using an app or writing it down on a notebook, keeping a budget is most effective when you do it in a format that works for you.\nIf you are looking for a budget template, Microsoft Office offers a holiday spending-focused version.\nCOMMUNICATE WITH YOUR LOVED ONES\nIf you\u2019re experiencing a lot of financial pressure this holiday season, Alev recommends that you try to communicate your feelings to your loved ones.\n\u201cOne of the hardest things is resentment can build up if you feel like you need to buy gifts for your family and you can barely make your student loan payments, so bring things up,\u201d Alev said.\nSharing your financial struggles can be hard. If you want to talk but don\u2019t want to share every detail of your financial struggles, that\u2019s okay. Ultimately, what you want is for your loved ones to understand how you\u2019re feeling.\nPlauch\u00e9 just recently started sharing her money worries with her family.\n\u201cI have been open with my family, just that I\u2019m not going to be able to give gifts that year,\u201d she said.\nEXPERIENCES VS. GIFTS\nAnother great way to save money is to skip material gifts and instead, grant your time. In many cases, your family would rather spend quality time with you.\nAlev recommended planning low-cost activities such as a hike with your family, or attending a free event in your city. Other options can be a holiday movie marathon with your friends, a free museum with your parents or a volunteering day with your family.\nUSE CREDIT RESPONSIBLY\nSince Plauch\u00e9 is already paying her student loan debt every month, she is avoiding using her credit card this holiday season to avoid carrying more debt.\nIf using your credit card is your only option, it\u2019s important that you use it wisely.\nIf you struggle with overspending during the holidays, Alev also recommends setting a budget for each of your credit cards.\nIf you can\u2019t pay your balance in full every month, it\u2019s important that you understand when you payment is due and have a plan to avoid paying a lot of interest.\nIf you\u2019re planning to use \u201c buy now, pay later services \u201d, it\u2019s best to be very intentional, Alev said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get caught up. It\u2019s easy to use it a lot and have several different payments that will come down the road,\u201d she said.\nAFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVES\nThere is more than one way to find the \u201cperfect\u201d gift for your family and it doesn\u2019t always involve spending a lot. In her quest to find gifts that don\u2019t cause her financial stress, Johnson has been getting creative.\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely been trying to save or just make gifts because I don\u2019t really have the disposable income to buy other people gifts or even buy myself a Christmas gift,\u201d Johnson said.\nShe\u2019s been looking into gifting a used book to her dad and because she loves painting and already has all the tools, she\u2019s working on a painting for her mom.\nOther affordable alternatives can be sending hand written notes to your loved ones, buying from thrift stores, hosting a cookie bake off or simply spending quality time with your family.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

{"title":"Investment options for high networth investors","context":"## Investment options for high networth investors\n\nIndia\u2019s remarkable economic growth has resulted in a notable increase in the country\u2019s high-net-worth investors (HNIs). According to recent wealth reports, the population of high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) with assets worth $1 million or more, which was 7.9 lakh in 2022, will rise to 16.5 lakh, a 107 per cent increase in five years.\nThe growing number of HNIs, as well as their desire to diversify their portfolios and access opportunities outside of traditional avenues such as stocks, mutual funds, and fixed deposits, has prompted the innovation of existing investment products, leading to the emergence of a new asset class known as \u2018Alternatives.\u2019\nAlthough the same principles of financial and investment planning apply to all investors, HNIs have an advantage. They can choose from a broader range of conventional and unconventional investment opportunities. Investing in unconventional avenues, such as Alternatives, can improve portfolio performance, generate alpha, and allow investors to grow their wealth faster.\nLet us look at a few examples of such investment opportunities:\n1. Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs)\nThese funds were launched in 2012 after the market regulator SEBI issued guidelines for their management. The guidelines enable AIFs to identify and make investment opportunities available to investors in the public and private markets. AIFs, for example, can invest in listed and unlisted equities via private equity, infrastructure assets, venture debt, stressed assets, start-ups, and so on.\nAs a result, the term \u201calternatives\u201d came about. The guidelines have divided these funds into three categories to make it easier for investors to understand the fund\u2019s investment objective. These categories are I, II, and III.\nA noteworthy feature of AIFs is that their returns are generally uncorrelated with publicly traded equity or debt markets, providing a natural hedge against volatility and genuine portfolio diversification.\nBecause of the minimum investment threshold of \u20b91 crore, AIFs are only available to HNIs. However, not all funds are required to collect \u20b91 crore in a single transaction. They can collect the money in tranches (called drawdowns) over 2-3 years. The drawdown mechanism makes these funds easy on the wallet. AIFs have amassed an AUM of \u20b98.30-lakh crore in the 11 years since their inception, demonstrating the shift of HNI money to this asset.\nThe following are some of the investment opportunities available only to HNIs and presented by AIFs:\na) Start-up funds: Angel investors looking to invest in ideas that have the potential to grow into full-scale businesses can do so through start-up funds, which provide a unique platform for bringing promoters and investors together. These funds handpick start-ups after extensive due diligence and build a portfolio with the potential to multiply capital several times.\nb) Mid-stage private equity (PE) funds: Investors who are hesitant to take the risk of investing in start-ups can invest in companies in the middle of their evolution cycle. Their business valuations grow exponentially as they mature and enter the late-stage or pre-IPO stage. The mid-stage PE fund allows investors to participate in the growth of such companies.\nc) Late-stage or pre-IPO funds: Pre-IPO funds allow investors to invest in mature companies preparing to list on the stock exchange. Such funds build a portfolio of companies about to go public and plan to exit them after their anticipated blockbuster listing, which can magnify returns in a relatively short period. Such funds gained immense popularity after the 2020 stock market rally that witnessed the blockbuster listing of some of the popular IPOs of B2C companies.\nd) Hedge funds: These funds invest in both publicly traded and unlisted stocks. They manage their funds using long-only and long-short strategies, with the latter allowed to use complex derivative techniques to hedge the portfolio. The specialty of long-short funds is that they try to optimise returns in every market situation. Hence, they tend to rise and fall lower than their peers. Investors with stock and mutual fund portfolios can diversify with hedge funds to reduce volatility.\ne) Performing credit funds: Many operating companies cannot raise funds from banks and NBFCs due to their size or credit ratings. This is where performing credit funds come into play. These funds specialise in credit risk assessment and, after thorough due diligence, offer credit to such companies at relatively higher rates, resulting in higher overall returns than AAA\/AA-rated bonds. These funds are attractive for investors seeking higher returns on their fixed-income portfolio, which includes debt funds and AA\/AAA-rated bonds.\nf) Infrastructure Funds: These funds invest in long-term infrastructure assets owned by PSUs or private companies, such as roads, power transmission lines, and solar power plants. Most infrastructure projects provide essential societal services and thus have intrinsic value. These assets generate cashflows in the form of annuities backed by Central and State governments, lowering the risk of future cash flows significantly. These annuities are regularly distributed by funds to the investors, giving them the characteristic of yield. When the fund reaches maturity, the assets may be sold to another fund or infrastructure trust, resulting in capital gains in overall fund returns.\ng) Venture debt funds: Start-up promoters frequently want to raise money without selling equity. As start-ups, they are unable to approach banks and mutual funds. This is where venture debt funds, which specialise in providing credit to start-ups, come in handy. It goes without saying that such AIFs help these start-ups raise funds at high rates. The higher returns of such funds and risk management appeal to risk-taking, yield-hungry investors.\nThe above fund list is not exhaustive but highlights some of the unique investment opportunities available to HNIs through AIFs. Many more such options are available to investors, such as special situation funds, real estate yield funds, and so on.\nAlong with the investment opportunities presented by AIFs, some other alternatives available to HNIs are:\n2. Portfolio Management Services (PMS)\nPMS guidelines in India date back to 1993, but this investment avenue has grown in popularity with HNIs recently. The growing financialisation of savings, the formalisation of the economy, and the growing prosperity of tier 2 and 3 cities have resulted in an increase in AUM (excluding EPFO\/PF), which stood at \u20b95.28 lakh crore as of July 2023. Because the minimum investment is \u20b950 lakh, this option is also only available to HNIs. Both PMS and mutual funds provide expert guidance in navigating volatile markets and seizing investment opportunities that help create wealth. Because mutual funds cater to retail investors, their guidelines are relatively stringent, and compliance is rigorous.\nRegarding PMS, the investment guidelines are somewhat more flexible, allowing portfolio managers to outperform mutual funds. Another feature that appeals to HNIs is that the beneficial ownership of securities is that of the investors, as opposed to mutual funds, where the ownership is that of the fund. Furthermore, PMS is available in two options: discretionary and non-discretionary. In the former case, the portfolio managers make all decisions; in the latter case, the investor makes all decisions.\n3. Market-linked Debentures (MLD)\nFor HNIs looking to invest a part of their investible surplus in debt, MLDs can be a prudent option. MLDs are non-convertible debt instruments whose returns are tied to a specific financial market benchmark, such as the Nifty 50, the BSE Sensex, or the 10-year G-Sec. The maturity periods of MLDs can vary from one year to five years.\nThough the minimum investment for MLDs is \u20b91 lakh, making it easier even for small investors to invest in them, they are more popular with the HNIs owing to the complex structure of these debentures. MLDs, unlike traditional fixed-income securities, do not provide periodic interest payments before maturity. Income multipliers and principal protection are common features of equity-linked MLDs. In the former case, the MLDs can generate a return that is a multiple of the underlying index\u2019s return. This increases the likelihood of a higher overall return for a more minor market movement. The latter option safeguards the principal (up to the face value of the debenture) in the event of an adverse market movement. This feature allows even investors with a moderate risk tolerance to easily participate in the market.\nFrom the discussion above, it is amply evident that HNIs have various alternative avenues to grow their wealth. The distinct value proposition of AIF, PMS, and MLDs, with unique features, distinctive risk-return profiles, and low correlation with traditional asset classes, makes them genuinely deserving of a place in the portfolio of every HNI. Before investing, investors should conduct thorough research to understand how these investment options work. It\u2019s important to consider the past track record and management team before making investment decisions. Consultation with investment advisors who are knowledgeable in this area can undoubtedly be beneficial.\nThe author is President & Head, Nuvama Wealth\n\nThis article was published by Business Line on 2023-10-28 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":252}
{"title":"Reliance Industries: With the stock having underperformed Nifty 50 in last three years, is it time to buy?","context":"## Reliance Industries: With the stock having underperformed Nifty 50 in last three years, is it time to buy?\n\nThe stock of India\u2019s most valued company, Reliance Industries (RIL), after a decade-long underperformance \u2014 from 2007 to 2017 \u2014 has managed to treble over the last six years.\nHowever, when you look at the stock on a three-year basis, RIL with 11 per cent CAGR returns (including the value of demerged Jio Financial Services), has underperformed Nifty 50 which has delivered CAGR returns of a little over 14 per cent in the same time period. This however is nothing to fret about. The stock of RIL has typically tended to underperform whenever the company has been in a heavy investment phase, something that it has embarked on in its green energy ventures.\nWith the stock still leaving some money on the table at current levels, long-term investors can accumulate it on dips for four reasons \u2014 one, reasonable valuations; two, being at pole position in India\u2019s high-growth digital and retail business; three, potential for large-scale value creation, similar to its digital and retail forays, in the renewable energy space (not reflected in current valuations); four, stable O2C business.\nGrowth engines\nThe launch of Jio\u2019s data services in 2016, maturation of the retail business and subsequent stake sales in FY21 were the key catalysts that drove the stock\u2019s outperformance in the last six years. Although there has already been a significant re-rating in valuation the markets have assigned to both businesses, scope for further outperformance from these businesses remains, given the opportunity ahead.\nReliance Jio: For one, with Reliance Jio emerging as the largest telecom services company in what is largely a duopolistic market (given survival issues at Vodafone Idea) in India, the growth potential remains strong as 5G will drive advances over the next few years and new 5G enabled use cases will create guzzling growth in data consumption, providing scope for higher ARPUs. Reliance Jio has offerings across the spectrum of wireless, wireline\/broadband, enterprise\/cloud services and allied retail\/enterprise digital offerings that make its services sticky for customers.\nIn such a scenario, its dominant position in telecom along with second player Bharti Airtel is likely well entrenched for the foreseeable future in India\u2019s digital ecosystem. These factors position it advantageously to sustain or increase its operating margins in a growing industry.\nReliance Retail Ventures: From a modest 1,691 stores in FY14, the retail business has grown to 18,040 stores (and over 66 million square feet of retail space) by FY23. Reliance Retail is the largest player in the country in the organised retail segment, operating brick-and-mortar, e-commerce, cash and carry, B2C, and B2B formats across the retail supply chain. With a low 3 per cent share of the market, there is scope for huge expansion from the combination of market share gains and\/in a high-growth market where the consumption theme is picking steam, driven by growth in per capita income.\nFor example, in the US, organised retail giant Walmart today has a little over 10 per cent share of the retail industry. While how exactly things will pan out in the Indian retail industry is out in the open, this can provide a perspective on the potential growth for Reliance Retail.\nIn recent years, Reliance Retail business has witnessed solid growth with FY21-23 revenue and EBITDA CAGR of 38 and 50 per cent respectively fuelled by a combination of store additions, acquisitions (totalling to $1.2 billion) and its phygital model with acquisitions such as Netmeds, Clovia being digital brands. Besides apparel, grocery and electronics, the company, through acquisitions, has gained foothold in newer segments such as pharmacy (Netmeds), fashion (Zivame, Clovia) and D2C (Urban ladder), which will drive growth in the medium term.\nWith dominance in digital and retail ecosystem and scope to enhance synergies across these, Reliance is strategically positioned to garner a good share of the consumer spending which will happen over the next decades with its consumer facing businesses.\nO2C & E&P\nRIL\u2019s traditional businesses \u2014 O2C and exploration (E&P) \u2014 still account for 45-50 per cent of RIL\u2019s consolidated EBITDA.\nSpanning expansive refining and petrochemicals business, the O2C business performance can be volatile depending on trends in crude oil prices and refining margins. In times of high crude oil prices, higher refining and petchem margins have helped the overall profitability. Similarly, there have been times when, due to falling crude prices, refining and petchem cracker have been on a falling spree, thereby adding to the pressure on the overall profit performance. Reliance\u2019s O2C business has best-in-class margins and may not be comparable to Indian refiners, given the scale of operations, efficiencies and export focus.\nOverall, while it remains a significant part of the company\u2019s business, it will not get the same high valuation like RIL\u2019s consumer facing businesses. In fact, based on value assigned to this segment by analysts, its overall contribution to RIL\u2019s valuation has not changed much from around the $75 billion it was estimated to be valued at when stake sale talks with Saudi Aramco were ongoing in 2019. Scope for increase in value in the medium term can arise from the company\u2019s expansion in the petrochemicals business.\nThe E&P business is small relative to overall size of Reliance. Analyst estimates for its value accounts for less than 10 per cent of overall RIL value.\nNext big thing\nHistorically any business that RIL has put its weight behind has ended up being one of the largest players in the field and also managed to create a lot of shareholder wealth.\nOn these lines, RIL has identified green energy as its next growth opportunity. As the world moves away from conventional fossil-based energy sources, towards cleaner and sustainable energy sources, the company is looking to capitalise on the huge demand potential for renewable power anticipated over the next few decades.\nThe company has committed a whopping \u20b975,000 crore investment into building a comprehensive green energy and green material ecosystem. At Jamnagar, it is building a green energy complex spread over 5,000 acres of land which, according to the company, will be among the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities globally. This will cost it \u20b960,000 crore, while the balance \u20b915,000 crore is being invested in partnerships, building future technologies, value chain to be able to build an integrated renewable energy ecosystem. The company has already made several investments in companies that are working on green energy technologies \u2014 such as battery technologies, solar cells\/panels, clean mobility solutions, software tools for solar energy, etc.\nWhile it\u2019s up in the air as to whether green energy investments will reap same dividends as RIL\u2019s telecom and retail forays, the good thing for investors is that market is hardly assigning any value to this business at current levels. Hence, there is scope for significant upside down the years from this business if the company repeats the success it has had in its other businesses.\nValuation\nReliance Industries currently trades at 24 times its trailing twelve-month earnings. While this is above RIL\u2019s pre-Covid three-year average valuation of around 20 times, given growth delivered by telecom and retail businesses post Covid, there is scope for further re-rating.\nSOTP: Reliance Retail Ventures, which is the flagship company, is currently valued at about $100 billion (\u20b98.3 lakh crore), based on recent transactions. RIL has an 83 per cent stake in it.\nReliance Jio, which is the other important segment of Reliance\u2019s business, was valued at $63 billion back in 2020. Market assigned value is $80\u201390 billion range - 10 to 11x one-year forward EBITDA, which is not expensive. RIL has 67 per cent stake in it.\nAdding the value of RIL\u2019s stake in the above businesses and around $75 billion (conservative and assumes no change in value in last 5 years) for its O2C business, the enterprise value for Reliance works out to around $214 billion. This excludes value of its E&P business and its media businesses and some value in its monetisable real estate. This also assigns zero value for its green energy business. RIL has net debt of around $15 billion. Adjusted for debt, its valuation is around $200 billion, which matches its current market cap. Adding value of E&P, and high potential for large-scale value creation from green energy business, there is some money left on the table for long-term investors who can accumulate the stock on dips.\nAt a time when small and mid-cap stock valuations are trading at dizzying valuations, large caps like RIL may be safer bets for the long term.\nWhy Growth engines intact Valuation reasonable Potential value of green energy business not reflected\n\nThis article was published by Business Line on 2023-12-09 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":253}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nA bride-to-be has been defended after choosing her mother to walk her down the aisle instead of her stepfather.\nIn a recent post shared to the popular \u201cAm I The A**hole?\u201d Reddit forum, the mother \u2013 who goes by the username u\/PopShort7064 \u2013 asked if she was in the wrong for agreeing to walk her child down the aisle, in addition to doing a mother\/daughter dance at the wedding. She specified that she also has a husband, who\u2019s been a stepfather to her daughter since she was 10.\nThe parent went on to give more context about her family, noting that she lost the father of her children - Calla and Hawthorn - when they were six and eight. She then shared that she remarried four years later, before opening up about her relationship with her second husband and how her children reacted to it.\n\u201cWe were friends for several months, dated some, stronger feelings developed and I introduced him to the kids to see how they would get along,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe halted for a year while my kids and I did some therapy because their reaction to my husband was strongly negative, because they didn\u2019t want to replace their dad. But once therapy was ongoing, they were doing better. From there, things move faster but the kids were on board for things to move on.\u201d\nThe mother specified that it was clear to her children that her husband \u201cwas not going to be filling the role of a dad in their lives\u201d. She added that her partner \u201cwas fine with that, as long as he was respected and they could work toward being a caring family\u201d.\nShe continued to note that while she had a close relationship with Calla, it was \u201cextremely tough\u201d for her child to lose her father. She specified that while her child has a good relationship with her stepfather, \u201cit comes nowhere close to the bond she had with her dad\u201d. She also shared that she continued to get close to her daughter after she turned 12, before recalling a point in Calla\u2019s childhood when she asked her mother to walk her down the aisle.\n\u201cShe was 15 when she told me if she ever got married she would want me to walk her down the aisle and for us to do a mother\/daughter dance instead of a father\/daughter one,\u201d the parent wrote. \u201cI told her we could dance to the song her dad used to sing to her. She said she loved the idea.\u201d\nThe Reddit user expressed that she \u201calways assumed things would change\u201d down the line, with her daughter either choosing to walk alone or with her brother, \u201cas a representation of her dad\u201d. However, she shared that when her daughter got engaged, she \u201casked [her mother] right away\u201d to walk her down the aisle.\n\u201cShe brought up our past conversation and told me she wanted exactly that. I told her I would be honoured,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe cried tears of joy together. I told her that her dad would be so proud.\u201d\nHowever, according to the Reddit user, her husband didn\u2019t take the news as expected. She explained that he asked her a series of questions, with the first one being if she asked Calla if both her mother and stepfather could walk her down the aisle. The woman noted that she didn\u2019t ask her daughter that.\n\u201cThen he asked if she ever considered asking him, and I said I could not answer that for her. He asked me if I thought of him when I said yes,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe asked whether I gave any thought to all he has done for Calla, for both kids, and the fact he\u2019s still not looked upon as a fatherly figure all these years later. I told him I did not think of him when asked because I was overjoyed. He told me I should have given him a lot more consideration and I should have tried to compromise with my daughter.\u201d\nShe claimed that three weeks after the incident, her husband hasn\u2019t changed his stance and he still feels like his wife \u201cwas wrong\u201d. She also said that he told her he \u201cfelt he deserved more from all\u201d of the family, and that his wife should be \u201cmaking sure he is respected and honoured for his contribution to the kids\u2019 lives\u201d.\nThe Reddit post has quickly gone viral, as it has received more than 6,500 upvotes. In the comments, many people have gone on to defend the bride\u2019s mother, noting that her husband should respect Calla\u2019s decisions for her wedding day. They also criticised the stepfather and claimed he should be more considerate of Calla\u2019s bond with her late father.\n\u201cI can tell you that no man, as you know, could ever hold a candle to my father so I feel comfortable saying that your daughter would probably never ask him [because] it would be like disrespecting the memory of her father,\u201d one wrote. \u201cAnd if your husband is close enough to your daughter, he could just ask her himself. It probably isn\u2019t as personal for her as it is for him, especially if you and your husband did not have any more children.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about him and all he\u2019s done. It\u2019s about Calla,\u201d another added. \u201cShe lost her dad and, while the grief fades a bit over the years, big events bring it roaring back in (at least that\u2019s been my experience). Her wedding is going to be bittersweet. She needs her parent (the one she\u2019s always had and the one who loved her dad) to \u2018give her away.\u2019\u201d\nA third wrote: \u201cThe real question here is why does your husband believe he\u2019s more entitled to this honour of walking your daughter down the aisle, and \u2018giving\u2019 her away than YOU? You, who is her mother, who has been there through it all, who has comforted and given her a home and place to be herself, unconditionally?\u201d\nThe Independent has contacted u\/PopShort7064 for comment.\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-11-27 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":254}

As he explained to People, most of his time lately has been spent on \"doing single dad stuff.\"\nThe boys' mother, Brooke Mueller, has struggled with drug addiction for several years. He said that recently she \"has been trying to figure some stuff out on her end, so she's not in the picture too much right now.\"\nCHARLIE SHEEN'S \u2018SURREAL\u2019 TV RETURN COMES AFTER HE COMPARED DRUG, ALCOHOL ADDICTION TO \u2018DEMONIC POSESSION\u2019\nMueller's rep declined to comment on the situation to Fox News Digital.\nSheen, who also has three daughters \u2014 one with a high school sweetheart and two with ex-wife Denise Richards \u2014 called his sons \"really cool, really smart and really funny,\" but admitted they do have a bit of a problem \"worshiping their devices.\"\nHe laughed, \"Although on the flip side, when they're doing that it gives me a little time to not be dragging them all over the city. But I also feel like the screens detract them from having other opportunities to expand their minds in other areas.\"\nSheen went through his own period of addiction several years ago \u2014 Richards famously took the twins in at one point when Sheen and Mueller were both deemed incapable of caring for them. But now, as he's preparing for a return to television and focusing so much on parenting, things seem to be looking up.\nFox News Digital takes a look at other celebrity fathers who have raised or are raising their children on their own.\nJohn Travolta\nJohn Travolta and Kelly Preston were married in 1991, and they had three children together: Jett, who died at 16 in 2009; Ella, 22; and Benjamin, 13. Preston passed away in 2020 after battling breast cancer.\nIn 2021, Travolta appeared on Kevin Hart's interview show \"Hart to Heart\" and shared an intimate conversation he had with Benjamin about the loss of his mother, recalling, \"(Ben) said to me once, 'Because mom passed away, I'm afraid you're going to.' I said, 'Well, it's a very different thing.' And I went through the differences about my longevity and her limited life.\"\nJOHN TRAVOLTA HONORS LATE WIFE KELLY PRESTON ON MOTHER'S DAY WITH SWEET THROWBACK VIDEO\nHe continued, \"I said, 'Ben, you have always loved the truth, and I'm going to tell you the truth about life. Nobody knows when they are going to go or when they are going to stay. Your brother left at 16. Too young. Your mother left at 57. That was too young. But who's to say? I could die tomorrow. You could. Anybody can. So let's look at it like it's part of life. You don't know exactly. You just do your best at trying to live the longest you can.\"\nLast year, Ella made a touching Father's Day post on social media for Travolta, calling him \"the smartest, kindest, most generous man I know.\"\nShe added, \"Just by being yourself, you have taught me the most important lessons in life. Thank you for everything you do and for being my friend. I love you Daddy.\"\nLiam Neeson\nLiam Neeson was married to actress Natasha Richardson from 1994 until her death after a skiing accident in 2009. They had two children together, sons Miche\u00e1l and Daniel. They were 13 and 12, respectively, when their mother died.\nIn 2014, he told GQ that raising his sons on his own was \"just still a day-to-day thing,\" explaining, \"They\u2019re flexing muscles and sometimes dangerous avenues, and you think, 'F---. If Tasha was here, someone could share this.' But yeah, we\u2019re doing all right, you know?\"\nHe said, \"The thing Tasha and I really wanted to instill in them was manners. That may sound like such a basic thing, but I\u2019ve heard so many adults say, 'Oh, my God, your sons \u2014 they look you straight in the eye. They\u2019re very polite and mannered.' It makes me proud. And it can get you through a lot, in a way. Just showing respect for your fellow man.\"\nLIAM NEESON'S \u2018RETRIBUTION\u2019 ACTION HERO ROLE LATEST IN STORIED CAREER MARKED BY LOVE AND LOSS\nNeeson also admitted to \"drinking too much\" after losing his wife. In another 2014 interview, this one with \"60 Minutes,\" he said that grief sometimes hit him \"like a wave. You just get this profound feeling of instability.\" He stopped drinking altogether in 2013.\nMiche\u00e1l and Daniel, now 28 and 27, are both actors. Miche\u00e1l took on his mother's surname of Richardson, something Neeson said was \"the right thing\" to do.\n\"I think it was a lovely homage, a nice gesture and he's, you know, he's not saddled with my last name which, I have a certain celebrity status I guess,\" Neeson told Andy Cohen in 2020. \"I'd hate for him to be constantly asked, 'Oh, are you Liam Neeson's son?' So, it was a lovely gesture.

They welcomed two sons together, Preston and Jayden, before divorcing in 2007. At the time of the divorce, they split custody, but a few months later, Federline would receive sole physical custody because of what a judge called Spears' \"habitual, frequent and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol.\"\nIn 2008, when Spears began experiencing trouble with her mental health, Federline was awarded sole legal custody as well. Spears was given visitation rights. In her recently released memoir, \"The Woman in Me,\" she claimed that she agreed to her conservatorship for her kids.\n\"Because I played by the rules, I was reunited with my boys,\" Spears explained.\nShe eventually gained more custody, though Federline has remained the kids' primary caregiver. They have lived with him since the divorce. Earlier this year, they moved to Hawaii with Spears' approval.\nAfter years of getting along, some tension began to show in 2022. Spears and Federline both shared negative posts on social media about the other, which they both deleted. Soon after, Preston and Jayden did a rare interview with ITV to discuss the situation.\nWhile Jayden clarified that there was \"no hate\" involved towards anyone, he said that \"it will take a lot of time and effort\" to fix their relationship with their mother. He clarified, \"I 100% think this can be fixed. It's just going to take a lot of time and effort. I just want her to get better mentally. When she gets better, I really want to see her again.\"\nIn a message directly to Spears, he said, \"I love you a lot, I hope for the best for you.

{"title":"What\u2019s at stake in the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark social media case","context":"## What\u2019s at stake in the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark social media case\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake in the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark social media case The court will wade into First Amendment questions with major implications for platforms\nThe Supreme Court is poised to decide whether a pair of state laws are allowed to reshape the ability of social media companies to control what does \u2014 and doesn\u2019t \u2014 appear on their platforms.\nLast week, the Supreme Court decided that it would hear the pair of cases, which revolve around Republicans crafting state-specific laws that order platforms to keep their hands off of some social media posts. Since the early days of the Trump administration, Republicans have accused social media companies of deliberately suppressing conservative viewpoints.\nWhile research has not supported these claims, researchers have demonstrated that conservative social media users are disproportionately exposed to political misinformation, a phenomenon that could explain anecdotal claims of ideologically lopsided enforcement on social platforms.\nWhether animated by those perceived differences or the political perks of accusing social platforms of anti-conservative bias, conservative lawmakers in Florida and Texas passed laws to restrict how those companies are allowed to moderate content.\nTo explain the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to wade into these issues \u2014 and what happens next \u2014 TechCrunch spoke to Paul Barrett, NYU adjunct law professor and Deputy Director of NYU Stern\u2019s Center for Business and Human Rights.\nWhy is the Supreme Court involved?\nThese cases actually started in Florida and Texas a few years ago before wending their way to the Supreme Court this year. In those two states, Republican lawmakers passed parallel laws to control how social media companies operate. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis signed Senate Bill 7072 into law in May 2021. In Texas, House Bill 20 made it through the state legislature and was signed by Governor Greg Abbott in September 2021.\n\u201cThe reason why these cases are in front of the Supreme Court is actually relatively simple: Florida and Texas were more or less the first out of the gate in imposing this type of restriction on social media companies,\u201d Barrett explained. \u201cSo when the industry sued the states under the First Amendment, these were the first cases that were litigated, so they went up through the court system.\u201d\nBoth laws made their way through the lower courts after tech industry group NetChoice and the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) issued legal challenges against them. That path was complicated and contradictory, which is part of how the case landed in the Supreme Court\u2019s lap:\nIn both cases, you had federal trial judges who entered injunctions blocking the laws on constitutional grounds. And then you had two different federal appellate courts \u2014 in the case of Florida, the Eleventh Circuit, in the case of Texas, the Fifth Circuit. The two appellate courts clashed\u2026 and there was an explicit conflict between the two federal appellate courts. And that type of conflict is one of the bases that the US Supreme Court uses for deciding when to take cases.\nWhat does this have to do with the First Amendment?\nThe case revolves around First Amendment rights \u2014 but, counterintuitively, it\u2019s the rights of social media companies that are in question, not the rights of their users.\n\u201cThe question here is: Do social media companies have a First Amendment protected right to exercise what you might call editorial judgment?\u201d\n\u201cThese cases are about the First Amendment and how the First Amendment applies to social media companies. And then more specifically, what the First Amendment has to say about content moderation, which is obviously a subset, although a really big and important subset of what social media companies do,\u201d Barrett said.\n\u201cThe question here is: Do social media companies have a First Amendment protected right to exercise what you might call editorial judgment \u2014 or what you also might call content moderation \u2014 in sorting out what expression does and does not appear on the platforms that they own? So it\u2019s just not clear right now what precisely the First Amendment says about that question.\u201d\nAre the Texas and Florida laws identical?\nThe two laws \u2014 HB 20 in Texas and SB 7072 in Florida \u2014 are very similar in their origins and intentions, but diverge slightly in how they seek to restrict social media platforms.\nIn both instances, a provision of the state law instructed social media companies to stop removing certain kinds of content. In Texas, the law told social media companies that they could no longer remove or demonetize content based on the \u201cviewpoint represented in the user\u2019s expression.\u201d In Florida, the law would stop social media companies from banning political candidates or removing or restricting their content. The laws have a few other provisions, but the idea is that conservative politicians in those states want to regulate how tech companies interact with political content.\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the same ballpark, the sentiment is the same,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cRepublican lawmakers in each state believe that \u2014 and said explicitly in the course of debating and passing these laws \u2014 that \u2018Silicon Valley oligarchs\u2019\u2026 are ideological liberals, and they are censoring people in our states who are conservative, and we are hereby ordering them to stop doing that.\u201d\nHow could the Supreme Court decision affect social media companies?\nIf the court finds that social media companies don\u2019t have a First Amendment right to curate the kinds of content that they allow, social platforms could look very different, at least in states that are trying to limit their moderation powers. After years of slow progress on misinformation \u2014 and worrisome backsliding on platforms like Elon Musk\u2019s X \u2014 the Supreme Court\u2019s decision could upend that process, sowing chaos online in the process.\n\u201cThanks to the First Amendment, Florida and Texas cannot force websites or social media apps to host hateful content, misinformation and spam, as their deeply misguided laws would require,\u201d Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, who co-authored Section 230, a law that protects social media companies\u2019 content moderation decisions, told TechCrunch. \u201c\u2026 A ruling in favor of the Texas and Florida laws would create utter chaos, and make many sites worthless to regular users who want to watch a funny video or see family photos.\u201d\nNetChoice President Steve DelBianco also warned that allowing the state laws to go into effect would unleash \u201ca tidal wave of offensive content and hate speech crashing onto users, creators, and advertisers\u201d that would force Americans to wade through \u201cracial epithets, aggressive homophobia, pornographic material, beheadings, or other gruesome content\u201d just to use social apps.\nAside from forcing platforms to allow some forms of content that would otherwise be disallowed, these laws also seek to force social media companies to provide users with individualized explanations when their content is removed or restricted.

{"title":"Taylor Swift's 1989: The stories behind her biggest album","context":"## Taylor Swift's 1989: The stories behind her biggest album\n\nTaylor Swift's biggest album 1989 returns with new tracks from the vault Published 27 October\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Taylor Swift's 1989 tour sold 2.2m tickets and earned more than $250m at the box office\nOn Friday, Taylor Swift released a new version of 1989 - the biggest-selling album of her career, and the one that definitively turned her into a pop star.\nFeaturing hits like Shake It Off, Blank Space and Style, it was originally written during the 2013-14 Red Tour, with demos stored on her phone in a folder named \"Sailor Twips\".\nAwarded a Grammy for album of the year, it has spent 325 weeks in the UK charts.\nBut now she has re-recorded it as the latest part of an ongoing campaign to regain control of her work, after an investment company bought her master tapes in 2019.\nThis is the biggest and riskiest part of the project. While earlier remakes were largely made with a live band, 1989's pop landscapes are full of squelchy, processed synths and treated vocals.\nFans can now find out how it has turned out - and hear five new tracks from the star's vault, expanding on the themes and relationships she explored on the original.\nHere's a guide to all the songs and what Taylor has said about them.\n1) Welcome To New York\n\"It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat forever more.\"\nWe open with a mission statement: The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now, she's dead.\nAfter building her reputation in Nashville, 1989 jettisons the banjos in favour of insistent, needling beats and tales of bohemian nightlife. \"A farewell to twang,\" the New York Times called it.\nTaylor knew change was necessary. \"I don't have the option of making music that sounds just like what I've done before,\" she told Popcrush. \"People will see right through it. They'll see that I was lazy\".\nHer label begged her to add three country-leaning songs to the album, but she stood her ground.\n\"At a certain point, if you chase two rabbits, you lose them both.\"\nWelcome To New York itself is the sound of creative and personal freedom. Taylor moved to the city in 2014 and was amazed to discover she could go grocery shopping largely incognito.\n\"My friends and people who know me have commented that I'm physically different since being here,\" she told NYC radio station WKTU. \"That song is about the endless hopefulness and endless possibilities that New York seems to present,\" she added in an interview with Access Hollywood.\nAll proceeds from the track are donated to New York City's Public Schools.\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, The original version of 1989 won three Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year\n2) Blank Space\nPretty much the perfect Taylor Swift song, Blank Space takes every horrible rumour that was being spread about her love life, and amplifies it with satirical relish.\n\"In the last couple of years the media have had a wonderful fixation on painting me as the psycho serial dater girl,\" she told the Grammy Museum. \"Every article was like, 'Here's Taylor Swift standing near some guy. WATCH OUT GUY!'\n\"My first reaction was to be like, 'That's a bummer. This isn't fun for me'. But my second reaction was, 'Hey, that's actually a really interesting character they're writing about: She jet-sets around the world collecting men - and she can get any of them, but she's so clingy that they leave and she cries in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls'.\n\"I was like, 'I can use this'.\"\nLyrically, it contains some of her best lines (\"darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream\") and there's a delicious attention to detail - with a pen click signifying every new entry in her little black book.\nShout-out to all the lonely Starbucks lovers; and to Chicago indie band Hard Femme who took that misheard lyric and made it a real song. Those search engine clicks gotta be lucrative, right?\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Many of 1989's songs were supposedly inspired by Taylor's relationship with Harry Styles\n3) Style\nAn epic aural painting of windswept coastlines and propulsive wanderlust, Style is (supposedly) named for Harry Styles, with whom Taylor had a brief relationship in 2012.\nExcept she says it was inspired by fashion, and how certain items like a black dress or red lipstick will \"never go out of style\". That prompted her to write about the people who'll always be part of your life, even after the flame of romantic love wanes (all of which sounds like a classic piece of deflection to a probing journalist).\nWhichever interpretation you prefer, the song marks a shift in Swift's psychology, as she briefly admits to having been unfaithful.\n\"I would never have said anything like that on a previous album,\" she told Ryan Seacrest.\n\"My previous albums have always been, 'I was right, you were wrong'. What happens when you grow up is you realise that the rules in a relationship are very blurred. It gets very complicated, very quickly.\"\n4) Out Of The Woods\nOne of 1989's strengths is how the music reflects the emotional tenor of the words. Here, that means frantic anxiety.\nAs Taylor and her partner run from forces that seek to destroy them, they're pursued by pounding drums and rushing synths. And there's a desperation to her voice, as though she's repeating \"everything's fine, everything's fine, everything's fine,\" against evidence to the contrary.\nBy the middle 8, it seems they've made a clean getaway. Then car brakes are slammed, and it's \"twenty stitches in a hospital room\".\nIn interviews, Taylor delighted in revealing this was based on a true story.\n\"It was almost like this very strange, subtle clue to the media that they don't know everything that happened in that relationship, and I can have something really major and traumatic happen to me and they don't know about it,\" she told NPR.\nIn her Rolling Stone cover story, Taylor said the crash actually occurred on a snowmobile \"with an ex who lost control and wrecked it so badly that she saw her life flash before her eyes\".\nThat prompted speculation the track was also about Styles: The couple had gone skiing with Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez in late 2012.\nThe lyrics also reference their identical aeroplane necklaces and a December break-up, which ties in with the \"Sad Taylor on a boat\" meme.\nBut the singer steadfastly refuses to name names: \"The fact that I've never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I'm holding,\" she told GQ.\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, 1989 was seen as a risk by Taylor's record label, but ended up becoming her biggest-selling album to date\n5) All You Had To Do Was Stay\nTraditionally, track five on a Taylor Swift album is the record's most raw and vulnerable moment - but All You Had To Do Was Stay is no Dear John or All Too Well.\nInstead, it's a big disinterested \"nope\" to an ex who comes back begging for a second chance.\nThe song came to Taylor in a dream where her ex turned up at the door and, instead of giving him a piece of her mind, all that came out was a high-pitched plea to \"stay\".\nWhen she woke, she recorded the sound into her phone and decided to base a song around it. Only this time, she got to say everything she wanted.\nImage source, Universal Music Group Image caption, The video for Shake It Off was filmed under intense secrecy\n6) Shake It Off\nRattling like a bag of spanners, Shake It Off is a 21st Century Hey Mickey, a honking great party record with a chorus that drills so far into your brain you start seeing lights.\nIt was the last song recorded for 1989, and Taylor arrived at the studio with a challenge for her co-writers Max Martin and Johan \"Shellback\" Schuster: \"We need drums that make even the person who's having a terrible night at the wedding [go], 'Oh, it's my song!'\"\nLike Blank Space, Shake It Off is a response to celebrity takedown culture. Taylor lists all of her supposed flaws (\"She's an airhead!' 'She dates too many men!\") with a defiant \"so what?\", sounding much less bothered than the girl who'd written Mean as a riposte to a snarky music critic three years earlier.\nReleased as 1989's first single, Taylor spent three days shooting a video, codenamed Project Sparrow, that built on the lyrical conceit.\n\"When I'm at award shows, I have the best time dancing [but] I'm really tall and lanky so I look a little bit like a baby giraffe learning how to walk,\" she told a group of young Swifties.\n\"So all over the internet, it's like,'Taylor Swift looks awkward when she dances'. And as soon as I wrote [Shake It Off] I knew I wanted to do an entire music video of me awkwardly dancing.\n\"I'm like, 'Yeah, I do dance awkwardly, but I'm having more fun than you.'\"\nImage caption, Taylor was one of the main stage headliners at Radio 1's Big Weekend in 2015\n7) I Wish You Would\nOne of Taylor's many 2am songs, I Wish You Would, is powered by a choppy, unrelenting guitar line that mimics her thoughts as they race uncontrollably in the middle of the night.\nShe's pining for an ex, absent-mindedly driving down their street and wishing she'd never hung up the phone or broken things off.\nBut in real life, the story was reversed. Taylor told Rolling Stone the song was \"about an ex who bought a house two blocks from hers\"; while a hidden message in the CD booklet said: \"He drove past her street each night.\"\nThe mystery deepens.\n8) Bad Blood\nBad Blood has the dubious distinction of taking last place in Rolling Stone's ranking of all 237 Taylor Swift songs.\nIt's certainly not her finest work - a vendetta disguised as a pop song, with a ham-fisted chorus that lacks her usual melodic instincts.\nSwift hinted in a Rolling Stone interview that the track was about a high-profile female musician, saying the person did something \"so horrible\" that made them \"straight-up enemies.\"\nAlthough she tried not to identify the target, it became common knowledge that Katy Perry was in the crosshairs, after allegedly \"stealing\" Taylor's backing dancers just before a tour.\nPerry confirmed the situation on James Corden's Carpool Karaoke, adding that she \"tried to talk to [Swift] about it and she wouldn't speak to me.\"\nThe pop divas eventually reconciled in the 2019 video for You Need To Calm Down... but Taylor's still performing Bad Blood on her Eras tour.\nImage source, Universal Music Group Image caption, The Bad Blood video featured an all-star \"squad\" of Taylor's female friends, including Cara Delevigne, Gigi Hadid, Cindy Crawford and many more\n9) Wildest Dreams\nGrowing up means letting go of youthful optimism, and Swift confronts that notion several times on 1989.\nOn one hand, she's developed an ability to laugh off her critics; on the other, she seems increasingly jaded about love.\nHere, she's imagining the end of a relationship before it's truly begun. When it all goes wrong, she asks her partner, \"Say you'll remember me \/ Standing in a nice dress \/ Staring at the sunset.\"\n\"The way I used to approach relationships was very idealistic,\" she told Rolling Stone. \"I used to go into them thinking, 'Maybe this is the one - we'll get married and have a family, this could be forever'.\n\"Whereas now I go in thinking, 'How long do we have on the clock before something comes along and puts a wrench in it, or your publicist calls and says this isn't a good idea?\"\nInterestingly, an early draft of the lyrics had the couple fleeing the city and blotting out the pressures of the world, an idea which eventually resurfaced in I Know Places.\n10) How You Get The Girl\nWhat's that? An acoustic guitar? Surely not...\nThis is one of the few 1989 tracks you can imagine working as a country song, if it was stripped of its whip-crack snare drums and buzzing basslines.\nOver that backing, Taylor turns agony aunt, dispensing advice on how to win back someone's heart... although her solutions (standing outside their house in the rain, bombarding them with cute photos) suggest she hasn't quite weaned herself off Love, Actually just yet.\n\"It's kind of a tutorial. All the steps you'd have to do to edge your way back into her life, because she's probably pretty mad at you\" she told Radio.com.\n\"If you follow the directions in this song, chances are things will work out\u2026 Or you may get a restraining order.\"\nImage source, Universal Music Group Image caption, Deluxe editions of the album came with collectible Polaroids featuring Taylor's favourite lyrics\n11) This Love\nTaylor was beginning to experiment with different vocal styles on 1989, and the multi-tracked, semi-whispered performance on this track foreshadows the delicate sounds of the Folklore and Evermore albums.\nThe effect is almost aquatic, as though Taylor is drowning in the high tide she depicts in the opening verse. And that suits the song perfectly, with its theme of cutting someone adrift because they're not ready for a full relationship.\nIn an interview with the Scholastic book club, Taylor said the song originally started out as a poem in her journal.\n\"I just wrote it down, and closed the book and put it back on my nightstand, like, 'Oh, that was fun'.\n\"Then all of a sudden in my head, I started hearing this melody - and that's when I realised it was going to be a song.\"\n12) I Know Places\nContinuing the theme of thwarted love, I Know Places was fuelled by Taylor's increasing anxiety over holding down relationships in the spotlight.\n\"I was like, 'No-one's gonna sign up for this. There are just too many cameras pointed at me, there are too many ridiculous elaborations on my life',\" she told the Grammy Museum.\n\"But I decided to write a love song [about] what would I say if I met someone really awesome and they were like, 'Hey, I'm worried about all this attention you get'.\n\"So I wrote this song about, 'Hey, I know all these places we could hide. We can outrun them'.\"\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, The 1989 tour saw almost the entire album played every night\n13) Clean\nCo-written with indie-pop auteur Imogen Heap, 1989's original album closer is very much the palette cleanser its title suggests.\nFor once, the cavernous 1980s drums are swapped for the plucked keys of a Zimbabwean mbira, while a weary Taylor emerges from the ruins of a relationship.\nAnd the song prompts one of her best lyrics - establishing drought as a metaphor for emotional desolation (\"the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst\") before she's reborn in the cleansing waters of a rainstorm: \"When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe \/ And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean.\"\nThe song is all about the necessity of pain, she told Popcrush.\n\"For most people that I've known who've fought through struggle, a lot them who have really just faced the pain head on have come out OK a lot faster than the ones who just pretended to be in denial of it.\"\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, The star gave an Alice In Wonderland-themed performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards\n14) Wonderland\n\"It's all fun and games til someone loses their mind.\"\nAfter dressing as the Mad Hatter at the 2013 Grammy Awards, Taylor returned to Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland for this EDM-tinged banger.\nThe song describes a fling with a \"green-eyed\" man (Styles again?) with whom she \"fell down a rabbit hole\" where \"nothing's as it seems\" until, in the end, \"we both went mad\".\n\"Any song [on 1989] that is touching on a relationship issue is looking back on it, and discussing what I learned, rather than you did this and now I feel this way,\" she told Radio 1. \"There aren't any accusations made. There aren't any outright diss tracks.\"\nOriginally a deluxe edition bonus track, Wonderland doesn't add anything new or insightful to the mix.\nEven Taylor agrees it's a minor entry in her songbook: To date, she's only played it seven times in concert.\n15) You Are In Love\nA gently-sung romance, this was inspired by Taylor observing her producer Jack Antonoff and his then-girlfriend, Lena Dunham.\n\"I remember thinking [the backing track] sounded so much like the sound of actual love, true love. Like, through thick and thin, sickness and health love,\" she told MTV.\nDrawing directly on conversations she'd had with Lena, the song blends scenes of everyday life (burnt toast, borrowed shirts) with moments of incandescent tenderness (kisses on sidewalks and late night heart-to-hearts).\nIn an interview with Elle, Taylor talked wistfully about the couple's ease around each other.\n\"I've never had that,\" she said. \"[But] now I have more of a grasp on the fact that when you're in a state of infatuation and you think everything that person does is perfect, it then - if you're lucky - morphs into a real relationship when you see that that person is not in fact perfect, but you still want to see them every day.\"\nImage source, Republic Records Image caption, Artwork for the re-recorded version of 1989 has a beach vibe, in contrast to the Polaroid aesthetics of the original\n16) New Romantics\nProof that even Taylor gets it wrong: New Romantics, one of her most beloved songs, was originally held back as a bonus track.\nIt's a beast, though. An armour-plated anthem to resilience and power, where Taylor takes all the pain that's come her way and uses it to make herself bulletproof.\n\"Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly,\" she declares, while glitterballs shatter around her. \"I could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at me.\"\nThat defiance also acts as a bridge to her next album, Reputation, which dismantled her critics, one-by-one. But that's for another article..\n17-21) Tracks from the vault\nIn 2014, Taylor said she had recorded more than 100 songs for 1989 - so the relative scarcity of vault tracks is intriguing.\nWhereas previous re-recordings have featured full discs of bonus material, this album gets just five new additions: Slut!, Say Don't Go, Now That We Don't Talk, Suburban Legends and Is It Over Now?\nAs a whole, they feel like dry runs for the songs that made the cut. The melodies aren't as crisp, the lyrics aren't as sharp. Suburban Legends has a particularly clunky line about letting a partner's indiscretions slide \"like a hose on a slippery plastic summer\".\nSlut! has piqued fans' interest for its title alone - who might she be talking about? No-one, it turns out.\nThe song is thematically similar to Blank Space, commenting on the media's portrayal of Taylor's relationships: \"But if I'm all dressed up \/ They might as well be lookin' at us \/ And if they call me a slut \/ You know it might be worth it for once.\"\nThe best of the new tracks is Is It Over Now. An angrier take on 1989's philosophical break-up songs, it calls back to the Harry Styles snowmobile incident (see also, Out Of The Woods) then, deliciously, references the \"Sad Taylor Boat\" meme - a photo of Taylor fleeing a vacation alone after the couple split up.\nShe goes on to call an ex a \"lying traitor\", accuses them of parading their new relationships in public, and noting that every new girlfriend looks like her.\n\"If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her.\"\nThe fact that all the new songs were co-written and produced by Jack Antonoff suggests there may have been rights issues over the tracks she wrote with Max Martin - who has not been involved with the new re-recordings.\nThat means the vault tracks are all bathed in the dreamy, soft-focus atmospherics of Out Of The Woods, rather than the upfront pop of Shake It Off.\nSpeaking in 2015, Taylor admitted she'd been brutal about pruning songs from 1989's original tracklist.\n\"There were so many songs I wrote for this album that were really good, but if I felt in any way that they would have belonged on my last album, Red, they got cut,\" she told New York radio's The Todd Show in the Morning.\n\"There are really, really good songs on the cutting room floor because they weren't innovative enough or new enough. It's so weird to look back on that - you've got heaping piles of discarded songs that I really loved when I wrote them and I still love now.\n\"I just need each album to have its own sound and if it doesn't fit that sound, it doesn't matter if it's a great song to me.\"\n\nThis article was published by BBC News - Entertainment & Arts on 2023-10-13 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":257}

How Texas, Oregon losses could impact Tide's 2023 chances\n\nWill the Crimson Tide endure a three-year drought in the College Football Playoff?\nNo. 8 Alabama (11-1) must beat No. 1 Georgia in the SEC championship at 4 p.m. on Saturday on CBS. By that time, the Crimson Tide will know what happened with No. 7 Texas. Alabama did get help with No. 3 Washington beating No. 5 Oregon in the Pac-12 championship game Friday.\nPac-12: No. 3 Washington 34, No. 5 Oregon 31\nNo. 3 Washington 34, No. 5 Oregon 31 Big 12: No. 7 Texas vs. No. 18 Oklahoma State (Saturday, 12 p.m., ABC)\nNo. 7 Texas vs. No. 18 Oklahoma State (Saturday, 12 p.m., ABC) SEC: No. 1 Georgia vs. No. 8 Alabama (Saturday, 4 p.m., CBS)\nNo. 1 Georgia vs. No. 8 Alabama (Saturday, 4 p.m., CBS) ACC: No. 4 Florida State vs. No. 14 Louisville (Saturday, 8 p.m., ABC)\nNo. 4 Florida State vs. No. 14 Louisville (Saturday, 8 p.m., ABC) Big Ten: No. 2 Michigan vs. vs. No. 16 Iowa (Saturday, 8 p.m., FOX)\nIn what has become an annual tradition, Alabama coach Nick Saban might have to do some politicking to get the Crimson Tide into the CFP conversation even with a victory against Georgia.\nThe Bulldogs are 5.5-point favorites against Alabama in the SEC championship game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, so all of this might be a moot point. Yet Alabama does have a path back to the CFP if they knock off the top-ranked team in the country.\nMORE: CFP scenarios, from chalk to chaos\nCan Alabama still make College Football Playoff?\nThe Crimson Tide are one of eight Power 5 teams with one loss or less heading into conference championship weekend. No two-loss team has ever made the four-team College Football Playoff.\nAlabama has options with a victory against Georgia, but this would be the preferred scenario for the other four championship games:\nWashington beats Oregon in Pac-12 championship\nAlabama got this piece in their favor. Washington beat Oregon in the Pac-12 championship on Friday, and that knocks the Ducks into the two-loss pileup and out of the CFP picture.\nOklahoma State beats Texas in Big 12 championship\nThis would make life easier in a lot of ways for Alabama, because Texas has a 34-24 head-to-head non-conference victory against the Crimson Tide. The Longhorns would have two losses at that point, so there would be nothing to discuss.\nIowa beats Michigan in Big Ten championship\nWhile this is the most-unlikely result, it could knock the Big Ten out of the CFP. Alabama is ranked behind No. 6 Ohio State \u2013 a one-loss team, but the Crimson Tide would leap-frog them with a victory against Georgia. The committee also would take an SEC champion over a one-loss Michigan team.\nLouisville beats Florida State in ACC championship\nEvery one-loss team is rooting for the Cardinals to knock off the Seminoles, which would free up one of the four spots in the CFP.\nMORE: Bowl projections | Championship games picks\nTwo Alabama College Football Playoff debates\nIf the above scenario unfolds, then the Crimson Tide would be in the CFP. Even if Michigan wins, Alabama would have a case with a Florida State loss.\nNow, depending on how the other games shake out, these potential head-to-head arguments could happen over the weekend.\nAlabama (12-1) vs. Texas (12-1)\nScenario No. 3 is the one everyone could be talking about. Washington, Florida State and Michigan win. Texas wins, too. That means there are three unbeatens and the committee must pick among the Longhorns, Crimson Tide and Bulldogs for the fourth spot. Texas beat Alabama at Bryant-Denny Stadium on Sept. 9. No matter how you try to talk around that, it might not happen for the Crimson Tide.\nAlabama (12-1) vs. Florida State (13-0)\nIf Saban cannot win the argument with Texas, then would he try to target Florida State instead? The Seminoles might be playing with a backup quarterback in Tate Rodamaker, but they beat LSU in Week 1. That victory would be worth cashing in at this point.\nAlabama strength of schedule\nAccording to ESPN, the Crimson Tide rank sixth in the Football Power Index. Texas is No. 7. Alabama has three victories against ranked teams this season, but none of those were top-10 victories. Georgia would be the signature victory on the schedule.\nAlabama strength of record\nAccording to ESPN, the Crimson Tide rank No. 7 in strength of record. Texas is No. 6 in those rankings. Those are comparable totals, but again, the matchup against Georgia would carry much more weight on conference championship weekend. It is the chance for an ultimate signature victory.\nWill Alabama make College Football Playoff?\nOregon lost. Seeing at least one of Texas or Florida State lose would be helpful for the Crimson Tide. There is the power of the SEC at work, and the emotional response by the committee to seeing Alabama beat Georgia might be enough on its own. The SEC is the only conference that has put a team in the CFP every single year.\nIf Alabama beats Georgia, then the arguments around those other conferences would get heated. Yet Florida State as an unbeaten team would still theoretically have the drop on the Crimson Tide. So would Texas based on the head-to-head victory. That could heat up quickly knowing Michigan likely will not lose in the Big Ten.\n\nThis article, authored by Bill Bender, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":258}
{"title":"College football odds, lines, schedule for Week 6: Texas, Alabama, Notre Dame among favorites in ranked games","context":"## College football odds, lines, schedule for Week 6: Texas, Alabama, Notre Dame among favorites in ranked games\n\nAn eventful first month of the 2023 college football season is in the rearview mirror, and October should provide even more separation between pretenders and contenders in the ongoing College Football Playoff race. Four AP Top 25 matchups are on deck in Week 6, headlined by the annual Red River Rivalry game between No. 3 Texas and No. 12 Oklahoma at the Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas. It will be the first time the two rivals have matched up undefeated since 2011, both sitting at 5-0.\nSaturday will also mark the first time that top-ranked Georgia has squared off against a ranked opponent this season as the Bulldogs welcome No. 20 Kentucky for a matchup of 5-0 squads. It's one of two ranked SEC matchups. No. 21 Missouri is also looking to stay undefeated as the Tigers host No. 23 LSU, which has now lost two games already after opening the year as a playoff contender.\nThe fourth and final AP Top 25 matchup of the day will be contested in ACC territory when No. 25 Louisville, sitting 5-0 in its first season under coach Jeff Brohm, sees No. 10 Notre Dame roll into town. The Fighting Irish are looking to secure a second ranked victory in as many weeks and remain in the playoff hunt after pulling off a comeback win at Duke in Week 5.\nBetting lines for those battles and other key Week 6 matchups were released on Sunday, so let's dive in on what the oddsmakers have given us.\nOdds via SportsLine consensus\nNo. 12 Oklahoma vs. No. 3 Texas (-5.5), Dallas: Always among college football's top spectacles, this year's Red River Rivalry could may serve as the Big 12 Championship Game preview. After one month, the Sooners and Longhorns are the only remaining undefeated Big 12 teams and are also the only ranked schools in the conference. Consider that a dream start for two programs that would love for nothing more than to run the league one more time before heading to the SEC in 2024. While the winner will emerge as the Big 12's clear front-runner, the playoff implications may be even more pressing. Neither team will be eliminated from that conversation Saturday, but the road becomes increasingly more difficult for the loser. A two-loss team has never cracked the playoff, so whoever comes up short in Dallas will likely have to win out to stand a chance.\nNo. 20 Kentucky at No. 1 Georgia (-15): The two-time reigning national champs are undefeated so far, but the Bulldogs have looked human at times. Georgia's two SEC victories have both required the Bulldogs to win in comeback fashion -- first at home against South Carolina in Week 3 and then at Auburn in Week 5. Georgia is still the heavy favorite for its first ranked matchup of the season, but coach Kirby Smart and company shouldn't sleep on the Wildcats. Kentucky's win against Florida in Week 5 saw running back Ray Davis take off for 280 yards and three touchdowns rushing, a mark that could have been much more considering Davis eclipsed the 200-yard mark well before halftime.\nNo. 23 LSU (-6.5) at No. 21 Missouri: While LSU has already gone from a trendy CFP pick to a two-loss team, Mizzou finds itself looking to improve on an impressive start that already includes a win against defending Big 12 champion and longtime former conference-mate Kansas State in Week 3. LSU is looking to right the ship on defense after a pair of shaky defensive performances. The Tigers allowed 426 yards in a 34-31 scare against Arkansas in Week 4 before giving up a whopping 637 yards Saturday in a 55-49 loss at Ole Miss. Mizzou quarterback Brady Cook ranks fourth in passing within the SEC (1,468 yards). He'll bring another test for that unit in Week 6. Through five weeks, Cook has thrown 11 touchdowns and is interception-free.\nNo. 10 Notre Dame (-6.5) at No. 25 Louisville: The Fighting Irish encounter another ranked opponent after being involved in dogfights each of the past two Saturdays. Notre Dame had its hearts broken by Ohio State in Week 4 before playing the role of heartbreaker at Duke in Week 5. Now it's on to Louisville, where the Irish encounter a Cardinals team that remains unbeaten a month into the Jeff Brohm era. While there isn't a ton separating these teams statistically on either side of the ball, Notre Dame is the more battle tested of the two, so it's not a shock to see the Irish checking in as a touchdown favorite. This is Louisville's first time facing ranked competition in 2023. It should give the best idea yet of what Brohm's squad is truly made of.\nNo. 11 Alabama (-3.5) at Texas A&M: The Crimson Tide have seemingly started to find a groove after an uninspiring 2-1 start, beating Ole Miss and Mississippi State a combined 64-27 for a 2-0 start in SEC play. But now comes a Texas A&M team that has caused fits for Alabama in their last two meetings. The Aggies stunned the top-ranked Tide on a walk-off field goal when Alabama last visited Kyle Field in 2021. In last year's meeting at Bryant-Denny Stadium Texas A&M had a chance to win the game on the final play of regulation before the Tide held off the Aggies for a 24-20 victory. An upset victory this weekend would move Texas A&M to 5-1 overall and 3-0 in SEC play. The Aggies have already dealt with the injury bug, losing starting quarterback Conner Weigman for the season.

{"title":"These jellyfish can learn without brains","context":"## These jellyfish can learn without brains\n\nFor Caribbean box jellyfish, learning is literally a no-brainer.\nDespite lacking a central brain, these animals learned to spot and avoid obstacles in a new study. This is the first evidence that jellyfish can do something called associative learning. That\u2019s the ability to make mental connections between events \u2014 such as seeing something and running into it \u2014 and then changing one\u2019s behavior accordingly.\n\u201cMaybe learning does not need a very complex nervous system,\u201d says Jan Bielecki. Maybe any creature with even a simple nervous system can learn. If so, this new insight might help point to how learning evolved in animals.\nBielecki studies animal nervous systems at Kiel University in Germany. He and his colleagues shared their new findings September 22 in Current Biology.\nEducators and Parents, Sign Up for The Cheat Sheet Weekly updates to help you use Science News Explores in the learning environment Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\nDodging obstacles\nThe nervous systems of Caribbean box jellyfish (Tripedalia cystophora) are fairly simple. They include four \u201crhopalia\u201d that dangle off a jellyfish\u2019s body. Each rhopalium has six \u201ceyes.\u201d It also has about 1,000 neurons to process what those eyes see.\nBox jellyfish use their vision to navigate the tropical lagoons in which they live. To hunt the tiny crustaceans they eat, these jellyfish must steer between the roots of mangrove trees.\nBut weaving between those roots is not simple. Caribbean box jellyfish judge a root\u2019s distance based on how dark it looks compared to the water. In other words, the jellyfish look at a root\u2019s contrast. In clear waters, nearby roots have high contrast. Only distant roots fade into the background. But in murky waters, even nearby roots can blend into their surroundings and have low contrast.\nWaters can become murky fast due to tides, algae and other factors. So the researchers wondered if Caribbean box jellyfish could learn that low-contrast objects \u2014 which might at first seem distant \u2014 were actually close by.\nWater tank tests\nTo find out, the team put 12 jellyfish into a round water tank. The tank was surrounded by low-contrast gray and white stripes. Such stripes might appear to a jellyfish like distant mangrove roots in clear water.\nA camera filmed the animals for about seven minutes. At first, the animals seemed to see the gray stripes as distant roots and swam into the tank wall. But those collisions seemed to lead the jellyfish to reconsider the stripes. Soon, the creatures treated the gray stripes more like close roots in murky water \u2014 and avoided them.\nThe jellies\u2019 average distance from the wall was about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in the first couple of minutes in the tank. By the final few minutes, they were an average 3.6 centimeters (1.4 inch) from the wall. The jellyfish also stopped bumping into the wall quite so much. Their average rate dropped from 1.8 bumps per minute to 0.78 per minute.\n\u201cI found that really amazing,\u201d says Nagayasu Nakanishi. \u201cI never thought that jellyfish could really learn.\u201d This biologist is based at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. He has studied jellyfish nervous systems before. But he didn\u2019t take part in the new work.\nBj\u00f6rn Brembs views the results more cautiously. He studies the nervous systems of animals at the University of Regensburg in Germany. Brembs points to the small number of jellyfish tested. \u201cI want this to be true, as it would be so very cool,\u201d he says of the results. But it will take tests with more jellyfish to convince him that the animals really do learn.\nJellyfish learning centers\nIn other tests, the researchers snipped rhopalia off jellyfish. They placed those eye-bearing nerve bundles in front of a screen. That screen showed low-contrast, light gray bars. Meanwhile, an electrode gave the rhopalia a weak electrical pulse. This mimicked the nerve signal a rhopalium would get if a jellyfish bumped into something.\nThe Caribbean box jellyfish has four rhopalia (circled). Each rhopalium has six eyes and about 1,000 neurons to process what it sees. Isabella Beyer, Bob Weber and Jan Bielecki\nAt first, the rhopalia ignored low-contrast bars, as if they were distant roots. But receiving \u201cbump\u201d signals when they saw those bars made them start paying attention. Their nerves started sending out the types of signals they emit when a jellyfish darts away from something.\nThis suggests that the rhopalia alone can learn that seemingly distant, low-contrast objects are in fact close enough to avoid. That, in turn, hints that these nerve centers are behind Caribbean box jellyfish learning.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the coolest part of the paper,\u201d says Ken Cheng. \u201cThat gets us one step down into the \u2026 wiring of how it works.\u201d Cheng is a biologist at Macquarie University. That\u2019s in Sydney, Australia.\nFor Ga\u00eblle Botton-Amiot, tracing learning to the rhopalia raises new questions. \u201cThey have four of these things in their bodies. So how does that work?\u201d asks this neurobiologist. If a jellyfish loses one of its rhopalia, does it forget everything those eyes saw and the neurons had learned? Or do the other rhopalia remember it?\nEvolution of learning\nBotton-Amiot has studied sea anemones at University of Fribourg in Switzerland. Her work hints that like jellyfish, those sea creatures can learn.\nSea anemones and jellyfish both belong to a group of animals called cnidarians. \u201cShowing that cnidarians that are so different [can both learn],\u201d she says, \u201cmeans that it\u2019s probably super widespread within them.\u201d Perhaps jellyfish and sea anemones both inherited that ability from a common ancestor.\nIt\u2019s also possible that the ability to learn arose in different animals independently, Nakanishi says. Finding out just how nerve cells in jellyfish or sea anemones accomplish learning could shed light on this. For instance, Nakanishi says, scientists could look at what chemicals play a role in how different animals learn.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a lot of similarities in the mechanism of how they learn, then that would be suggestive of common ancestry,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if they evolved independently, then you would perhaps expect very different mechanisms of learning.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Maria Temming, was published by Science News For Students on 2023-12-01 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":261}
{"title":"Nobel Prize winner shocked by early morning phone call from Sweden: 'It was ringing during the night, but I didn\u2019t answer it because I\u2019m trying to get some sleep, basically'","context":"## Nobel Prize winner shocked by early morning phone call from Sweden: 'It was ringing during the night, but I didn\u2019t answer it because I\u2019m trying to get some sleep, basically'\n\nThree scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry Wednesday for their work on quantum dots \u2014 tiny particles just a few nanometers in diameter that can release very bright colored light and whose applications in everyday life include electronics and medical imaging.\nMoungi Bawendi of MIT, Louis Brus of Columbia University, and Alexei Ekimov of Nanocrystals Technology Inc., were honored for their work with the tiny particles that \u201chave unique properties and now spread their light from television screens and LED lamps,\u201d according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which announced the award in Stockholm.\nThe suspense surrounding the academy\u2019s decision took an unusual turn when Swedish media reported the winners several hours before the prize was announced. The advance notice apparently came from a news release sent out early by mistake.WHAT DISCOVERY WON THE NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY?\nQuantum dots are tiny inorganic particles that glow a range of colors from red to blue when exposed to light. The color they emit depends upon the size of the particle.\nScientists can engineer the dots from materials that include gold to graphene to cadmium, and create their color by controlling their size. The tiniest particles, in which electrons are most tightly confined, emit blue light. Slightly larger particles, in which electrons bounce around a longer wavelength, emit red light.\nChemists sometimes compare the size of the particle itself to a confining box.\nThe underlying \u201cparticle in a box\u201d theory of quantum mechanics was first described nearly a century ago. But it wasn\u2019t until several decades later that scientists could manufacture quantum dots in a lab.\nIn the 1980s, Ekimov, 78, and Brus, 80, honed the theory and developed early laboratory techniques for creating particles that emit varying colors by adjusting sizes. In 1993, Bawendi, 62, developed new chemical methods for producing the particles quickly and uniformly \u2014 which soon enabled a variety of scalable commercial applications, including in electronics displays.\nJudy Giordan, president of the American Chemical Society, said she was thrilled at this year\u2019s winners.\n\u201cWhat we care about a lot in chemistry is being able to make and tailor novel structures and architectures to solve problems that help people and the planet,\u201d Giordan said.\nRigoberto Advincula, a materials chemist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, said the work helped bridge the fields of physics and chemistry, adding: \u201cThis technology is very easy to reproduce \u2014 that\u2019s why it became so popular and so widespread.\u201d\nToday quantum dots are commonly used in electronics displays and biomedical imaging. The florescent quality of the particles allows researchers to track how drugs are delivered within the human body, as well as to study the precise location and growth of a tumor, for example.WERE THE WINNERS ANNOUNCED PREMATURELY?\nSwedish media reported hours before Wednesday\u2019s announcement that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences had sent out a news release that identified Bawendi, Brus and Ekimov as the latest Nobel laureates.\nPublic broadcaster SVT said the release said they were receiving the prize for the \u201cdiscovery and synthesis of quantum dots.\u201d\nAfter officially announcing the three winners, Secretary-General Hans Ellegren said the Swedish academy would investigate how the information got out in advance.\n\u201cThere was a press release sent out for still unknown reasons. We have been very active this morning to find out exactly what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very unfortunate and we deeply regret what happened.\u201d\nThe academy, which awards the physics, chemistry and economics prizes, asks for nominations a year in advance from thousands of university professors and other scholars around the world.\nA committee for each prize then discusses candidates in a series of meetings before presenting one or more proposals to the full academy for a vote. The deliberations, including the names of nominees other than the winners, are kept confidential for 50 years.HOW DID THE WINNERS REACT?\nBawendi told the news conference he was \u201cvery surprised, sleepy, shocked, unexpected and very honored.\u201d\nAsked about the leak, he said he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been made a Nobel laureate until he was called by the academy.\nBawendi said he was not thinking about the possible applications of his work when he started researching quantum dots.\n\u201cThe motivation really is the basic science. A basic understanding, the curiosity of how does the world work? And that\u2019s what drives scientists and academic scientists to do what they do,\u201d he said.\nBrus, a professor emeritus at Columbia, said he didn\u2019t pick up the phone when the early morning call came from the Swedish academy to notify him.\n\u201cIt was ringing during the night, but I didn\u2019t answer it because I\u2019m trying to get some sleep, basically,\u201d he told The Associated Press. He finally saw the news online when he got up around 6 a.m.\n\u201cI certainly was not expecting this,\u201d Brus said.\nBrus said he was glad to see recognition for the area of chemistry he practices. The practical applications of quantum dots, like creating the colors in flatscreen TVs, are something he was hoping for when he started the work decades ago, he said.\n\u201cBasic research is extremely hard to predict exactly how it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d Brus said. \u201cIt\u2019s more for the knowledge base than it is for the actual materials. But in this case, it\u2019s both.\u201d\nEkimov is the former chief scientist at Nanocrystals Technology, a company based in New York where he started working in 1999. The Swedish academy credited him with demonstrating in the early 1980s that the size of copper chloride nanoparticles affected the colors in glass.\n\u201cIt was really nice that we got it after 40 years of work,\u201d Ekimov told the AP. His first publication on the topic was in 1981.\nOn Tuesday, the physics prize went to French-Swedish physicist Anne L\u2019Huillier, French scientist Pierre Agostini and Hungarian-born Ferenc Krausz for producing the first split-second glimpse into the super-fast world of spinning electrons.\nOn Monday, Hungarian-American Katalin Karik\u00f3 and American Drew Weissman won the Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.\nThe prizes in literature, peace and economics follow, with one announcement every weekday until Monday.\nThe Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the prize\u2019s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.\n___\nLarson reported from Washington.

{"title":"Hipgnosis Songs Fund\u2019s board is concerned over Citrin Cooperman\u2019s latest valuation of the company. What\u2019s it going to do about it?","context":"## Hipgnosis Songs Fund\u2019s board is concerned over Citrin Cooperman\u2019s latest valuation of the company. What\u2019s it going to do about it?\n\nWHAT\u2019S HAPPENED?\nMBW Explains is a series of analytical features in which we explore the context behind major music industry talking points \u2013 and suggest what might happen next. MBW Explains is supported by JKBX , a technology platform that offers consumers access to music royalties as an asset class.\nThe drama at Hipgnosis Songs Fund isn\u2019t letting up for the Holidays, it seems.\nThis morning (December 19), the company\u2019s board \u2013 now led by Chairman, Rob Naylor \u2013 issued a statement announcing that HSF would no longer, as previously expected, be issuing its latest financial results today.\nInstead, the results (covering the six months to end of September 2023) are now expected to be published sometime before the close of December 31.\nThe reason for the delay? According to UK-listed HSF, it\u2019s all to do with a recently-updated company valuation from HSF\u2019s official independent valuer, US-headquartered Citrin Cooperman (CC).\nThe HSF board says this valuation from CC was \u201cmaterially higher than the valuation implied by proposed and recent transactions in the sector\u201d.\nHSF\u2019s board particularly points to two transactions\/would-be transactions as evidence:\nThe proposed sale earlier this year of assets to Blackstone-backed Hipgnosis Songs Capital for USD $440 million (pre-costs) \u2013 or $417.5 million (post-costs) \u2013 a proposal that was ultimately rejected by HSF shareholders; The sale of 20,000 \u201cnon-core\u201d songs from HSF\u2019s portfolio to an unnamed buyer (possibly Kobalt Music Group) for $23.1 million, as announced on December 11. That price, according to HSF\u2019s board, represented a 14.2% discount on Citrin Cooperman\u2019s valuation of this portfolio as of September 30 (something we\u2019ll come back to).\nAs part of its announcement this morning, the HSF board took something of a swipe at its investment adviser, Merck Mercuriadis\u2018 Hipgnosis Song Management.\nAfter seeing Citrin Cooperman\u2019s latest valuation and believing it to be too high, said HSF, it then \u201csought advice from Hipgnosis Song Management\u2026 which is majority owned by funds managed and\/or advised by Blackstone, on their opinion on the independent valuer\u2019s valuation.\u201d\nHSF\u2019s board added: \u201cHipgnosis Song Management\u2026 eventually provided an opinion, which was heavily caveated, such that the Board has concerns as to the valuation of the Company\u2019s assets in its interim results.\u201d\nIn response, Hipgnosis Song Management issued its own statement today: \u201cHipgnosis Song Management has fulfilled its duties to [HSF] with respect to both the independent valuation and preparation of the interim results in a timely and efficient manner.\n\u201cNotwithstanding the Board\u2019s decision to delay publication of the interim financial statements, [we] will continue to work in a constructive manner to support the interests of the Company and its shareholders.\u201d\nThe oddest thing about all of this? Citrin Cooperman\u2019s valuation of Hipgnosis Songs Fund is, according to HSF\u2019s own company documentation, appointed and overseen\u2026 by the HSF board.\nSee this line, in every annual and interim report from HSF so far (bolding MBW\u2019s own): \u201cPortfolio Independent Valuer\u2026 Citrin Cooperman Advisors LLC, formerly Massarsky Consulting, Inc., [is] appointed by the Board to independently value the Company\u2019s Catalogues within the Portfolio.\u201d\nNot to mention this line in various HSF company reports to date: \u201cThe [HSF] Board is ultimately and solely responsible for overseeing the valuation of the Company\u2019s investments in music catalogues and has appointed [Citrin Cooperman] to perform this specialist work.\u201d\nWHAT\u2019S really going on?\nIt\u2019s a fair bet that Hipgnosis Songs Fund\u2019s board \u2013 which last week appointed activist investor Christopher Mills as a non-exec Director \u2013 is making something of a \u2018hidden\u2019 statement to shareholders with today\u2019s announcement.\nIt may be a coded attempt by HSF\u2019s board to gnash teeth towards HSM\/Mercuriadis\u2019 \u2018call option\u2019 \u2013 which, as MBW has pointed out before, leaves the exec with the exclusive power to sweep in and acquire HSF\u2019s portfolio under several different circumstances.\nThere are a few clues in HSF\u2019s latest public statement to this end, perhaps including its rare \u2013 not to mention conspicuous \u2013 mention of HSM being \u201cmajority-owned by funds managed and\/or advised by Blackstone\u201c.\nIn addition, today\u2019s statement is also a clear signal from the HSF board that it has understandable concerns over the now-infamous \u2018discount rate\u2019 used by Citrin Cooperman to value HSF\u2019s portfolio (as MBW covered in depth through here).\nCitrin Cooperman continues to stick to an 8.5% discount rate in its valuations, despite interest rate rises over the past 12-18 months \u2013 and has long refused to move this 8.5% figure upwards to, say, 9% or 9.5%.\nIf Citrin Cooperman ever did raise this discount rate, the independent valuation of Hipgnosis Songs Fund\u2019s portfolio would, in turn, instantly fall.\nWorth remembering: The HSF board has known about Citrin Cooperman\u2019s latest valuation (as of September 30) for at least the past eight days.\nWe know this because, as mentioned, on December 11, HSF announced that the $23.1 million price of an agreed HSF \u2018non-core\u2019 asset sale represented a 14.2% discount vs. Citrin Cooperman\u2019s latest valuation of the portfolio (i.e. the HSF board had seen this latest valuation).\nYet it took until today (December 19) for HSF to alert its investors to its dissatisfaction with this valuation.\nWHAT does JP Morgan make of it all?\nOne of the closest watchers of Hipgnosis Songs Fund in recent years has been JP Morgan and its analyst Christopher Brown.\nIn a rather damning note issued today covering the delay in the publication of HSF\u2019s results, Brown wrote: \u201cThis is an early blow to the credibility of the new [Hipgnosis Songs Fund] Board, and casts further doubt over the credibility of the independent valuer, Citrin Cooperman.\u201d\nBrown added that he was \u201csurprised\u201d to see that a second valuation expert had not been drafted in to value the HSF portfolio for the latest interim results, especially as Kroll was appointed to consider the \u201creasonableness\u201d of Citrin Cooperman\u2019s assumptions for HSF\u2019s previous set of results (to end of March 2023).\nAdded Brown: \u201cWe think the easiest solution now for the [HSF] Board is to apply an additional discount rate to the [Citrin Cooperman] valuation to reflect current market uncertainty, on the basis that it is probably too late to employ another valuer.\u201d\nBrown noted that a 0.5% rise in Citrin Cooperman\u2019s discount rate (i.e. raising it from 8.5% to 9.0%) would \u201creduce the fair value of the [HSF] portfolio by 7.9%, which on a leveraged basis is [approximately a] 10% reduction in NAV [Net Asset Value]\u201d.\nShould HSF\u2019s board go down this route, he noted, he expected \u201cthe [HSF] shares to weaken\u2026 given that this represents another \u2018unforced error\u2019\u201d.\n\u201cThis is an early blow to the credibility of the new [Hipgnosis Songs Fund] Board, and casts further doubt over the credibility of the independent valuer, Citrin Cooperman.\u201d Christopher Brown, JP Morgan, on the HSF board statement today (December 19)\nIn addition, Brown expressed his surprise that HSF asked HSM to \u201copine on the valuation given [HSM\u2019s] conflict of interest\u201d.\nHis point: If HSM turned around and said, \u201cyep, HSF\u2019s valuation is 25% too high, better bring it down\u201d, then it would produce a new valuation for HSF that may allow Blackstone (or the Blackstone-controlled Hipgnosis Song Capital) to launch an acquisition bid for the HSF portfolio. (Or, at least, a part of that portfolio.)\nThe likely price for this hypothetical Blackstone bid would be smaller than the failed $440 million ($418.5 million post-costs) bid that HSC (via HSM) made for a chunk of the HSF portfolio earlier this year.\n\u201c[It] is up to the [Hipgnosis Songs Fund] Board to satisfy itself that the independent valuer, whom it hires, is up to the job, rather than try and pin the blame on [Hipgnosis Songs Management].\u201d Christopher Brown, JP Morgan\nConcluded Brown: \u201c[It] is up to the [Hipgnosis Songs Fund] Board to satisfy itself that the independent valuer, whom it hires, is up to the job, rather than try and pin the blame on [Hipgnosis Songs Management].\n\u201cOur view is that a breakdown in the relationship between Board and manager would not be optimal for maximising shareholder value.\u201d\nBrown further noted that JP Morgan would \u201cnot be surprised to see Citrin Cooperman resign, having been very publicly undermined by the [HSF] Board today\u201d.\nJP Morgan retained its \u2018overweight\u2019 rating against HSF\u2019s share price \u201cin spite of yet another [HSF] own goal\u201d.\nA Final thought\u2026\nAs mentioned in the opening sentence of this article, there is plenty of drama surrounding HSF right now \u2013 from the \u2018discontinuation vote\u2019 we saw at the company in October, through to a recent lawsuit launched against Hipgnosis Songs Fund by a former business partner of Merck Mercuriadis.\nYet, amongst all of the noise, what will likely most interest HSF\u2019s investors (including the likes of Investec Wealth & Investment, Aviva Investors, and BlackRock) is the ongoing underlying commercial performance of the firm\u2019s copyrights.\nHow are Hipgnosis Songs Fund\u2019s assets performing vs. the market? How is the company\u2019s \u2018premium-only\u2019 acquisition strategy holding up against its promise of growth \u201cuncorrelated\u201d to other industries? And what does all of this suggest about the ongoing growth potential of the HSF portfolio vs. the multiples that Merck Mercuriadis paid to acquire it?\nSuch questions will only be answered when Hipgnosis Songs Fund\u2019s board elects to release the company\u2019s six-monthly financial results to end of September 30.\nThe most important KPI within those results, in MBW\u2019s view: the company\u2019s Pro-Forma Revenue, and how it compares, like-for-like, vs. the previous year\u2019s equivalent period.\nIn the meantime, back in the \u2018real world\u2019 of the music biz, HSF is actually enjoying quite a fanciable Q4.\nThe company is benefitting from its cuts on hit albums including Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), via its acquired Jack Antonoff catalog, as well as Swift\u2019s Lover (via its acquired Joel Little catalog).\nHSF\u2019s investments in seasonal Christmas \u2018evergreens\u2019 continue to pay off too, with cuts on Michael Buble\u2019s Christmas album and \u2013 most famously \u2013 a share of Mariah Carey\u2019s perennial megahit, All I Want For Christmas Is You.\nJKBX (pronounced \"Jukebox\") unlocks shared value from things people love by offering consumers access to music as an asset class \u2014 it calls them Royalty Shares. In short: JKBX makes it possible for you to invest in music the same way you invest in stocks and other securities.Music Business Worldwide\n\nThis article, authored by Tim Ingham, was published by Music Business Worldwide on 2023-12-19 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":263}

Remember that you can only place bets when you are in the state lines, but you can access your account and monitor wagers from anywhere you have internet access.\nMLB live betting\nThe best sports betting apps offer live, in-game betting for Major League Baseball.\nLive betting means you can bet on a game in progress, right down to what the next batter will do with the next pitch or what team will win the inning.\nYou\u2019ll find live betting with top betting sites such as DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, and Caesars.\nThe key to live betting is using a betting app to make your wagers. Apps allow you to track all of the changes \u2014 both on the diamond and in the odds \u2014 as they happen. You won\u2019t find that response time at a brick-and-mortar sportsbook.\nSome common MLB in-game betting lines includes:\nNext team to score\nRun line and moneyline odds\nTotal runs scored\nWinner of the next inning\nPlayer props, such as total hits or strikeouts\nBet on MLB run lines, moneylines, and totals\nThree of the most popular bet types for Major League Baseball games are run lines, moneylines, and totals. In case you\u2019re not familiar, let\u2019s explain all three.\nA moneyline wager is as straightforward as they come. You\u2019re betting on which team you believe is going to win the game. Each team is given odds by the sportsbook to indicate their perceived chances of winning. The underdog is represented by a positive (+) number, and the favorite is represented by a negative number (-).\nSimilar to a point spread in other sports, the run line bet gives the underdog a handicap of 1.5 runs in the game. The underdog needs to lose by one run or win outright for bets on them to be successful, while the favorite in the game needs to win by two runs or more to cover the spread.\nTotals bets, also known as over\/unders, focus on the combined number of runs both teams score. Oddsmakers assign a total number of runs, and bettors must decide if the two teams will score over or under that predicted total. The actual winner of the game doesn\u2019t matter.\nYou\u2019ll find these staple bet types at every online sportsbook that supports MLB betting.\nHow to bet First 5 Innings in MLB\nFor bettors who prefer to focus on the early portion of a Major League Baseball game, First 5 Innings or F5 bets are ideal. These bets concern the outcome of just the first five innings of a game, which often takes out the uncertainty of relief pitchers replacing the starters.\nYou\u2019ll find the F5 bets in the MLB tab of your online sportsbook or MLB betting app, where you can browse the available odds and lines for those particular wagers. You can still place bets on moneylines, run lines, or totals\u2014focused on only the first five innings of play.\nKeep in mind that the odds and lines will likely be different than those for the full game since they are concentrated on the first half of the game only.\nBest MLB props and futures\nMLB props and futures allow you to bet on team and player performance irrespective of individual game outcomes. Some examples of popular MLB futures odds and proposition bets include:\nWorld Series: You can bet on which team you believe will become the next World Series champion. You\u2019ll find World Series futures odds for these nearly as soon as the previous World Series comes to an end, and they\u2019ll change based on offseason moves, team news, team performance, and more.\nYou can bet on which team you believe will become the next World Series champion.

Regular-season win totals: Make an over\/under wager on a team based on the number of wins a sportsbook sets for them. Do you think your team will finish over that predicted win total, or will they come in under it?\nEvery sportsbook offers its own selection of futures and props bets, so shop around to find the sportsbooks that best fit your needs.\nHow to find the best MLB lines\nIt stands to reason that bettors always seek the most favorable MLB odds. \u201cLine shopping\u201d involves researching several different sportsbooks to compare odds.\nThis might involve using an odds feed, like the ones you\u2019ll find here, or by comparing the odds on multiple online sportsbooks or MLB betting apps.\nBy doing this research, you\u2019ll find the best odds for the bets you were already planning on making, which means you can maximize your potential return on your wager.\nThis can be a time-consuming process, but it also helps you boost your bankroll and give yourself the largest possible profit.\nMLB betting rules at online sportsbooks\nEvery sportsbook has terms and conditions for all bets, MLB included. While those rules may be specific to each sportsbook, there are some general rules that should apply everywhere.\nFor example, MLB First 5 Innings bets are usually considered actionable after five innings of play, or 4.5 innings in the case of the home team having the lead.\nAnother rule many sportsbooks follow for baseball bets is weather-related, such as if a game is suspended due to rain or other weather conditions. These delays may lead to bets being refunded depending on the circumstances and the specific rules of your sportsbook.\nHere are some other rules found at online sportsbooks for MLB betting.\nWagers include extra innings unless specified otherwise.\nThe game must start on the scheduled day (local stadium time) for bets to have action.\nThe game must go 9 innings or 8\u00bd if the home team is winning for the run line to have action.\nOn \u2018team to score first\u2019 wagers, once a run is scored, the prop will be graded, regardless of how long the game lasts.\nWagers on postseason baseball series are based on the team to win the series, regardless of the number of games involved.\nFor player props, the player must be in the starting lineup for wagers to have action.\nIt\u2019s important to read through the rules for baseball betting before placing your MLB bets, and you can find them in the terms and conditions section of your sportsbook\u2019s website.\nRelated Pages:\n\nThis article, authored by Sam Eggleston, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-24 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":264}

When season five arrived last year, there were calls for the show to include a \u201cfictional explainer\u201d \u2013 something Netflix did not do.\nWith the show heading into the late Nineties and early Noughties in its final season, which arrived on Netflix on Thursday (16 November), events are being depicted on screen that many of the public will remember well.\nThe first part of season six takes place in the summer of 1997, and sees Prince Charles (Dominic West) building on his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams), while Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) sparks up a romance with film producer Dodi Fayed (Khalid Abdalla). The show also features the pair\u2019s death in a car crash in Paris.\nAs the new season arrives, and fans wonder what in The Crown is based in reality, here\u2019s everything you need to know.\nDiana\u2019s role with Tony Blair\u2019s government\nEpisode one sees Diana visiting Tony (Bertie Carvel) and Cherie Blair (Lydia Leonard) with William after asking for a meeting with him. Recalling their discussion to the Queen, Blair says that Diana feels she \u201cstill has a lot to offer the country as a public servant\u201d. He says that she had asked if there was a way to work with the government on \u201ca more formal basis\u201d and that any \u201cofficial role\u201d would be appreciated.\nBertie Carvel as Blair (Netflix)\nFollowing Diana\u2019s death, Downing Street confirmed that Diana had visited Blair at Chequers with her son a few weeks before, where they discussed a special role for her as an overseas \u201cambassador\u201d for Britain. Diana told a journalist at the time that the prime minister had recognised her skills and asked her to undertake \u201cmissions\u201d abroad for Britain.\nQueen Elizabeth\u2019s reluctance to accept Camilla\nAs The Crown season six begins, Charles is frustrated at the public for demonising Camilla long after his split from Diana. Asks the Queen if she\u2019d received the invitation to Camilla\u2019s 50th birthday, to which she says she has, but cannot attend as she\u2019s in Derbyshire. When Charles points out that plans \u201ccan always be changed\u201d, she replies: \u201cWhy would we want to change it?\u201d She doesn\u2019t attend, but later tells Prince Philip that she doesn\u2019t want for Camilla to be considered \u201cwicked, because she\u2019s not\u201d or to be unkind to her.\nCharles (West) hosts Camilla\u2019s (Williams) birthday (Netflix)\nIt took a while for Queen Elizabeth and Camilla to grow close. According to historian Robert Lacey, she was reluctant to accept Charles\u2019s request to be more accommodating to Camilla. Unlike in The Crown, she is said to have once referred to Camilla as \u201cthat wicked woman\u201d to Charles\u2019s face. However, she grew to become closer to Camilla. Despite announcing in 2005 that Camilla would become the Princess Consort rather than Queen Consort, it was announced that Camilla would be queen seven months before Elizabeth\u2019s death.\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\nDodi Fayed\u2019s engagement to an American model\nWhen viewers first meet Dodi in The Crown, he\u2019s in Paris with a woman with short, blonde hair. However, it\u2019s not Diana, but an American woman who he says he\u2019s picking out fabric for a Malibu home with and says he\u2019s marrying in three weeks. His father Mohamed is unimpressed, calling him to Saint Tropez to meet a \u201cspecial guest\u201d and leave his \u201cgold-digger\u201d fiance \u2013 who he also calls \u201cMadame Bikini\u201d \u2013 behind. The model later confronts Dodi, asking if he was with Diana when he leaves her to go see his father. Diana also alludes to a \u201clawsuit\u201d between Dodi and his ex.\nDiana (Debicki) and Dodi (Abdalla) (PA)\nThis storyline comes to close to the truth as told by model Kelly Fisher, who claimed to have been engaged to Dodi when he met Diana. Fisher had previously modelled for brands such as Victoria\u2019s Secret and magazines including Elle and Marie Claire. As in The Crown, Fisher \u2013 who met Fayed in July 1996 \u2013 was on another Fayed yacht when Dodi and Diana were first photographed. She staged a press conference where she announced that she was filing a breach-of-contract lawsuit against Dodi, after he allegedly asked her to stop modelling as much and prioritise the relationship. Through tears, she claimed that he had proposed to her (something his family denied) and promised to buy her a house in Malibu. However, she dropped the lawsuit following Dodi\u2019s death.\nDiana\u2019s close relationship with paparazzi on France yacht trip\nWhen Dodi and Diana first spend time together on his father\u2019s yacht in France, the paparazzi are never far away. However, when William refuses to go outside until the photographers leave them alone, she takes a boat out to visit them. Wearing a swimming costume, she asks them: \u201cWe\u2019re having a lovely time, apart from one little thing: you lot.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be like that, you love us really,\u201d they reply. Diana asks them to leave her alone as they\u2019re \u201cfreaking out\u201d her sons, before telling one photographer \u2013 who she knows by name \u2013 that if they go away, \u201cyou\u2019re going to get a big surprise with the next thing I do\u201d. She then poses for them in her swimsuit, but complains in a later episode that they can \u201cnever relax\u201d with the press \u201cconstantly\u201d around.\nDiana (Debicki) on the Fayed yacht (Daniel Escale\/Netflix)\nFormer Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown, who wrote the controversial 2007 book Diana Chronicles, claimed that Diana would often tip off the press and \u201c couldn\u2019t resist giving them the images they wanted\u201d, including on the boat. Photographer Daniel Pirrie, who ended up selling the photo of the kiss, claimed that Diana herself invited him to photograph her on holiday with Dodi in France that summer. \u201cShe told me she\u2019d be on the yacht somewhere in the Mediterranean,\u201d he told The Daily Mail in 2013. \u201cShe let me know she was going to be on a tender going out to the yacht. I think overall, she was happy with all the pictures taken that summer\u2026 I knew that Diana had wanted [the kiss photo] to be taken.\u201d\nMohamed al Fayed\u2019s role in securing kiss photo\nThroughout season six, Mohamed al Fayed (Salim Daw) is shown as heavily invested in his son Dodi\u2019s relationship with Diana, even ringing up the maid to ask if they have been \u201cintimate\u201d. In Arabic, he then asks his secretary if they can find him an Arabic photographer \u2013 \u201cnot just any idiot with a long lens\u201d, but \u201cthe best photographer on the Meditarranean\u201d.\nSalim Daw as Mohamed al Fayed (Netflix)\nIt\u2019s not known whether Mohamed was so instrumental in securing the photo of Dodi and Diana kissing for the first time. However, following the Harrods owner\u2019s death this year, biographer Tom Bower recalled in The Times how Al-Fayed \u201cgleefully\u201d showed him the photographs of Dodi and Diana and allegedly \u201crevealed how he had rapidly bought a yacht suitable for his son\u2019s seduction of her\u201d.\nDodi\u2019s proposal to Diana on the night they died\nAfter bursting into tears going for dinner at the Ritz, move upstairs, he proposes to her with a ring she had previously pointed out when they sheltered from crowds in a Monte Carlo jewellery shop. She tells him to get up off his knee \u201cI know the whole world is wondering if we\u2019re going to get married, but that\u2019s not a reason to actually do it.\u201d However, they share a drink and bittersweet conversation about how they need to live their lives going forward - advice\nDodi is shown proposing to Diana before they died (Daniel Escale\/Netflix)\nIn real life, Dodi did not propose to Diana on that fateful evening in Paris. However, at the inquest into the death in 2007, the jury were shown CCTV footage of him purchasing an engagement ring worth \u00a311,600 in a jewellers across the square from the Ritz on the afternoon of the crash. It was later believed to have been delivered to their room before they went to Dodi\u2019s flat, where a ring bearing the words \u201cDis-moi Oui\u201d (\u201cTell me Yes\u201d) \u2013 also the name of episode three \u2013 was later recovered, alongside a receipt for a \u201cbague de fian\u00e7aille\u201d (engagement ring). Speaking at the inquest, his father Mohamed claimed that the pair had met the jeweller in Monte Carlo during the holiday on the yacht, and that he believed Dodi planned to propose that night.\nPrince William goes missing in Balmoral after Diana\u2019s death\nAfter learning of Diana\u2019s death from his father at the royal residence of Balmoral in Scotland, William (Rufus Kampa) is left heartbroken with grief and angry at his family\u2019s response to it. At one point, Charles is informed that the prince is not in his room and that \u201cno one can find him\u201d, prompting Charles and Prince Harry to look for him and a subsequent hunt across the grounds for the young royal. He is not located, but later walks back to the house on his own accord, drenched in rain. \u201c14 hours, that poor boy was gone,\u201d the Queen later says.\nWilliam (Kampa) goes missing after his mother\u2019s death (Keith Bernstein)\nIt\u2019s true that William and Harry initially stayed in Balmoral with their grandmother following the death of Diana. While it\u2019s not known whether he went missing, during a visit to Scotland in 2021, William recalled how that experience was one of the \u201csaddest\u201d moments of his life. \u201cI was in Balmoral when I was told that my mother had died. Still in shock, I found sanctuary in the service at Crathie Kirk that very morning,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd in the dark days of grief that followed, I found comfort and solace in the Scottish outdoors. As a result, the connection I feel to Scotland will forever run deep.\u201d\nThe Crown season six part one is on Netflix now, with part two arriving on 14 December.\n\nThis article, authored by Isobel Lewis, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-11-17 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":265}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nThe first four episodes of The Crown season six are officially here, but many viewers believe one scene has depicted the most devastating moment throughout the entire series.\nOn 16 November, Netflix dropped the first four episodes of The Crown\u2019s final season, followed by the last six episodes on 14 December. The latest installment takes place between the late 1990s to mid-2000s, and includes the lead-up to Princess Diana\u2019s fatal Paris car crash in 1997.\nThe season begins with Princess Diana (played by Elizabeth Debicki) whisking her sons - Prince William (played by Rufus Kampa) and Prince Harry (played by Fflyn Edwards) - away on summer holiday to Saint-Tropez, France. After staying several days on Mohamed Al Fayed\u2019s yacht, the boys return home to London where their father, the then-Prince of Wales, accompanies them to Balmoral Castle to vacation with the rest of the royal family in Scotland.\nIn episode three, Diana\u2019s partner Dodi Fayed (played by Khalid Abdalla) surprises her with a quick trip to Paris, France. However, the princess is keen to return home to the United Kingdom, and is eager to speak to her sons over the phone. A mob of paparazzi following the couple delays Diana\u2019s scheduled phone call with William and Harry, until she\u2019s able to catch them again later that evening.\nIt is in this scene that The Crown depicts the doting mother\u2019s final conversation with her sons.\nWilliam, then 15, and Harry, then 12, inquire over the phone when their mother will be coming back home from Paris. \u201cI\u2019m coming home tomorrow, and I\u2019m seeing you both tomorrow night,\u201d Diana replies in the episode, which also takes place on the same day as her fatal car crash later that evening. The boys then ask Diana whether she plans on marrying Dodi, considering their relationship has been plastered all over the tabloids.\nDiana\u2019s poignant last words to William and Harry shown in The Crown scene\n\u201cWell, you know better than to believe the papers,\u201d she tells William, before adding: \u201cI\u2019m emphatically not going to marry Dodi. To be honest, I can\u2019t wait to come home.\u201d\nWhen William sweetly asks his mother if she\u2019s doing \u201cokay\u201d, Diana candidly tells her eldest son: \u201cI\u2019m okay. It\u2019s just a bit mad here. I don\u2019t really understand how I ended up here. Mummy just needs to make some changes to her life, that\u2019s all. But that\u2019s not your problem, that\u2019s mine.\u201d\nBefore saying their goodbyes, Diana reminds William and Harry that she will be seeing them the next day - although that day never comes. \u201cI\u2019ll see you both tomorrow night,\u201d she says. \u201cJust the three of us.\u201d\nThe moment unsurprisingly tugged on the heartstrings of many viewers, who took to social media to share their thoughts on the devastating moment.\n\u201cThe last phone call between Harry, William and Diana broke my heart,\u201d one fan wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\u201cThat precious phone call between Diana and her sons,\u201d said someone else. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m just gonna cry in one corner.\u201d\n\u201cThe last call between Harry, William and Diana is heartbreaking,\u201d a third user commented.\nIn both the series and in real-life, Diana and Dodi - along with their chauffeur, Henri Paul - were killed on 31 August 1997 when their Mercedes-Benz was pursued by paparazzi and crashed in the Pont de l\u2019Alma tunnel in Paris. The mother of two was 36 years old.\nThe fatal car crash was recreated in the very first scene of season six. While the incident is not shown on-screen, a car carrying Diana and Dodi is seen speeding past a man walking his dog, before entering the tunnel. As the vehicle\u2019s horn blares, he calls emergency services on his cell phone.\nAustralian actor Elizabeth Debicki, who took over the role of Diana from Emma Corrin in season five, admitted it was \u201cdifficult to recreate\u201d the scene - especially with her character being hounded by the paparazzi. \u201cIt was heavy and very manic, and incredibly invasive. And it had a kind of pressure to it,\u201d Debicki said in an interview with Netflix.\n\u201cAt times it\u2019s almost like an animalistic response to being pursued, by that many actors playing the press, because there\u2019s nowhere you can go and you only have to be in a situation like that for about a minute, before you realise this is completely unbearable.\u201d\nThe first four episodes of The Crown season six are available to stream on Netflix in the US and UK.\n\nThis article, authored by Meredith Clark, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-11-17 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":266}
{"title":"WebSummit derailed by founder\u2019s public fight with those supporting Israel in Hamas conflict","context":"## WebSummit derailed by founder\u2019s public fight with those supporting Israel in Hamas conflict\n\nWeb Summit, the big tech conference brand that runs events in several cities and whose 70,000 person flagship event in Lisbon is taking place next month, is running into a wall \u2014 a wall of outrage. Founders, investors and others from the technology community in Israel have gone ballistic over comments made by the founder and figurehead of Web Summit, Paddy Cosgrave, related to the fighting underway across Israel and Gaza, specifically his criticism of Israel\u2019s retaliatory actions.\nNow, the anger with Cosgrave has gone viral, and today it looked like it was about to overrun promotion efforts for Web Summit.\nThe situation also highlights how Israel\u2019s tech industry, the country\u2019s most valuable and arguably best-known export, built on business development and relationships, has been willing to cut those ties in the battle of public opinion in this most polarizing of conflicts.\n\u201cHere in Israel, we\u2019re basically now in rage mode after the first week of shock and awe,\u201d one tech source told TechCrunch. \u201cWe ain\u2019t got time to f_ck around with anyone remotely suggesting Israel needs to sit it out and not put an end to Hamas.\u201d\nIt all started the day that Hamas busted through Israel\u2019s walls and rampaged through villages and a music festival on a murdering and pillaging spree, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Hamas, the ruling party in the Palestinian territory, is considered a terrorist organization by the U.K., U.S. and other countries; they also took 199 hostages back into Gaza.\nOn that day, Cosgrave was in Doha, Qatar, the city where Web Summit will be holding its newest event in four months\u2019 time. As some were taking to social media to express shock, or sympathy, or in some cases, advocating for restraint, some took more critical stances. Cosgrave, for his part, posted data on X of the human cost of the Israel-Palestine conflict between 2008 and 2023. It omitted the events (and casualties) of the weekend.\nThat stirred debate, but Cosgrave didn\u2019t acknowledge that the numbers were out of date or comment about the attacks in Israel. He instead proceeded, over the next several days \u2014 between posts about Qatar, political comments related to Ireland, and rugby reactions \u2014 to put out several more posts, all highlighting the opinion that Israel was taking an unjust approach.\nAs the posts racked up a range of alarming and extreme responses on both sides of the argument, Cosgrave doubled down. On Friday, he noted he was \u201cshocked by the rhetoric and actions of so many Western leaders\u201d in supporting Israel. But as attention mounted, the rejections to Web Summit started, too.\nSome of the highlights (or I guess you could say, lowlights):\nDavid Marcus said he would never again attend, sponsor or speak at another Web Summit event. \u201cSaddened by your ill-informed stance. You could\u2019ve taken a more nuanced one, condemning these atrocities and calling for restraint. That would\u2019ve been acceptable,\u201d wrote David Marcus, the longtime fintech entrepreneur and Meta executive, in a tweet yesterday. \u201cYou chose to support terrorists. As such I\u2019ll never attend\/sponsor\/speak at any of your events again.\u201d\n\u201cWill refuse to work with anyone who speaks at this conference in Qatar for the rest of my career,\u201d chimed in Keith Rabois, the Founders Fund partner and entrepreneur.\nOri Goshen, the co-founder and co-CEO of AI21 Labs, announced on LinkedIn that he would no longer be giving a keynote at Web Summit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave didn\u2019t see fit to express horror at the sickening atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7th,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as immoral as that is, Paddy Cosgrave chose to not only ignore these but instead post something against the policies of the Israeli government. Leaving aside his very partial understanding of history and geopolitics, this response was abhorrent. We at AI21 cannot be part of such indecency and moral bankruptcy. We will not attend WebSummit, and I will not give the keynote. #cancelwebsummit #standwithisrael\u201d\nThen the Israeli ambassador to Portugal, Dor Shapiro, waded in.\n\u201cToday, I wrote to the Mayor of Lisbon informing him that Israel will not participate in the #WebSummit conference due to the outrageous statements made by the conference CEO Paddy Cosgrave. Even during these difficult times, he is unable to set aside his extreme political views and denounce the Hamas terrorist activities against innocent people,\u201d he wrote, also on LinkedIn. \u201cDozens of companies have already canceled their participation in this conference, and we encourage more to do so.\u201d\nBy today, Cosgrave appeared to walk back his statement. \u201cWe are devastated to see the terrible killings and the level of innocent civilian casualties in Israel and Gaza,\u201d Cosgrave wrote, nine days Hamas invaded Israel. \u201cWe condemn the attacks by Hamas and extend our deepest sympathies to everyone who has lost loved ones. We hope for peaceful reconciliation.\u201d\nUnder so much fire, however, he subsequently dug in his heels, tweeting afterward: \u201cTo repeat: War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies & should be called out for what they are. I will not relent.\u201d\nDamage has been done to Cosgrave and the Web Summit brand in the interim.\n\u201cHard to take this statement at face value \u2014 given all the tweets @paddycosgrave has been liking over the last few days. I saved several of them on the attached google doc (so we have a record when the @WebSummit PR team asks him to delete them),\u201d said Josh Kopelman, the founder of First Round Capital.\nKopelman separately suggested in a tweet that Cosgrave is in the pocket of Doha and Qatar, a country that many believe is connected to the financing of Hamas. That was enough to push Garry Tan, the head of Y Combinator, over the edge, too.\n\u201cI refuse to appear at Web Summit and am canceling my appearance,\u201d he said. \u201cI condemn Hamas and pray for peace for the Israeli and Palestinian people.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Tan and Kopelman to ask if they are advising portfolio companies and partners at their firms against also attending. Tan declined to comment, and Kopelman has yet to respond.\nWeb Summit has provided us with a statement on the cancellations, saying that the organization is talking to \u201ca number of people about their attendance at Web Summit\u201d but is not in a position to discuss exacts and individuals.\n\u201cWe understand that it is an incredibly sensitive and painful time during this utter tragedy of war. We want to reiterate our devastation for the loss of innocent life in Israel and Gaza. We strongly condemn the horrific attacks by Hamas on Israelis. Web Summit\u2019s mission is to connect people and ideas changing the world from all around the globe. The more voices we have from around the world, the more we can help change the world for the better,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are saddened to hear that some Israelis in the tech community will no longer be attending Web Summit. We regret any hurt caused and extend our deepest sympathies to everyone who has lost loved ones. We hope for peaceful reconciliation.\u201d\nThe spokesperson said that last year\u2019s event attracted about 71,000 people and this year it\u2019s on track to \u201cmax out\u201d at 70,000.\nA public page in Notion titled \u201ctechcondemingterror\u201d is tracking the growing response. It now includes press clippings, comments from a number of leaders in Israel\u2019s technology industry and comments.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-16 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":267}
{"title":"Meta and IBM form an AI Alliance, but to what end?","context":"## Meta and IBM form an AI Alliance, but to what end?\n\nMeta, on an open source tear, wants to spread its influence in the ongoing battle for AI mindshare.\nThis morning, the social network announced that it\u2019s teaming up with IBM, whose audience is decidedly more corporate and enterprise, to launch the AI Alliance, an industry body to support \u201copen innovation\u201d and \u201copen science\u201d in AI.\nSo what will the AI Alliance do exactly \u2014 and how will its work differ from the quite similar (at least in terms of its overarching mission, members and tenets) Partnership on AI? The Partnership on AI years ago promised to publish research using open source licenses and minutes from its meetings to, as the AI Alliance purportedly seeks to do, educate the public on pressing AI issues of the day.\nWell \u2014 confusingly \u2014 the Partnership on AI is in fact a member of the AI Alliance. The Alliance says that it plans to \u201cutilize pre-existing collaborations\u201d (including the Partnership on AI\u2019s, presumably) to \u201cidentify opportunities that develop open AI resources that meet the needs of business and society equally and responsibly,\u201d a press release shared last week with TechCrunch reads.\nThe AI Alliance\u2019s members will first form working groups, a governing board and a technical oversight committee dedicated to advancing areas like AI \u201ctrust and validation\u201d metrics, hardware and infrastructure that supports AI training and open source AI models and frameworks. They\u2019ll also establish project standards and guidelines, and then partner with \u201cimportant existing initiatives\u201d \u2014 initiatives conspicuously not named in the press release \u2014 from government, nonprofit and civil society organizations \u201cwho are doing valuable and aligned work in the AI space.\u201d\nIf that sounds a lot like what the inaugural members of the Alliance were already doing independently, you\u2019re not wrong. But in the release, the AI Alliance stresses that its work \u2014 whatever form it ultimately takes \u2014 is intended to be complementary and additive rather than needlessly duplicative.\n\u201c[M]ore collaboration and information sharing will help the community innovate faster and more inclusively, and identify specific risks and mitigate those risks before putting a product into the world,\u201d the release reads. \u201cThis stands in contrast to a vision that aims to relegate AI innovation and value creation to a small number of companies with a closed, proprietary vision for the AI industry.\u201d\nKey subtext\nThat jab at the end says a lot about Meta\u2019s ulterior motives, here.\nGoogle, OpenAI and Microsoft, a close OpenAI partner and investor, have been among the chief critics of Meta\u2019s open source AI approach, arguing that it\u2019s potentially dangerous and disinformation-encouraging. (Unsurprisingly, none are members of the AI Alliance despite being longtime members of the Partnership on AI.) Now, those companies have a clear horse in the race and perhaps regulatory capture on the mind\u2026 but they\u2019re not wrong entirely. Meta continues to take calculated open sourcing risks (within the bounds of regulators\u2019 tolerances), releasing text-generating models like Llama that bad actors have gone on to abuse but which plenty of developers have built useful apps upon.\n\u201cThe platform that will win will be the open one,\u201d Yann LeCun, Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist, was quoted as saying in an interview with The New York Times \u2014 and who\u2019s among the more than 70 influential signers of a letter calling for more openness in AI development. LeCun has a point; according to one estimate, Stability AI\u2019s open source AI-powered image generator, Stable Diffusion, released last August, is now responsible for 80% of all AI-generated imagery.\nBut wait, you might say \u2014 what does IBM gain from the AI Alliance? It\u2019s a co-founder with Meta after all. I\u2019d venture to guess more exposure for its burgeoning generative AI platform. IBM\u2019s most recent earnings were boosted by enterprises\u2019 interest in generative AI, but the company has stiff competition in Microsoft and OpenAI (and to a lesser extent Google), which are jointly developing enterprise-focused AI services that directly compete with IBM\u2019s.\nI\u2019ve asked IBM\u2019s PR, which first informed me of the AI Alliance\u2019s founding, about the curious omissions from the early membership, like Stanford (which has a prominent AI research lab, Stanford HAI), MIT (which is at the forefront of robotics research) and high-profile AI startups like Anthropic, Cohere and Adept. A press rep didn\u2019t respond as of publication time. But the same philosophical differences that kept Google and Microsoft away likely were at play; I\u2019d wager it\u2019s no accident that Anthropic, Cohere and Adept have relatively few open source AI projects to their names.\nI\u2019ll note that Nvidia isn\u2019t a member of the AI Alliance, either \u2014 a suspect absence given that the company is by far the dominant provider of AI chips and a maintainer of many open source models in its own right. Perhaps the chipmaker perceived a conflict of interest in collaborating with Intel and AMD. Or perhaps it decided to cast its lot with Microsoft, Google and the rest of the tech giants opting out of the Alliance for strategic reasons. Who can say?\nSriram Raghavan, VP of IBM\u2019s research AI division, told me via email that the Alliance is, for now, focused on \u201cmembers that are strongly committed to open innovation and open source AI\u201d \u2014 implying that those who aren\u2019t participating aren\u2019t as strongly committed. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d agree.\n\u201cThis of course is just the starting point,\u201d he added. \u201cWe welcome and expect more organizations to join in the future.\u201d\nA broad assembly\nCounting around 45 organizations among its membership, including AMD and Intel, the research lab CERN, universities like Yale and the Imperial College London and AI startups Stability AI and Hugging Face, the AI Alliance will focus on fostering an \u201copen\u201d community and enabling developers and researchers to \u201caccelerate responsible innovation in AI\u201d while \u201censuring scientific rigor, trust, safety, security, diversity and economic competitiveness,\u201d according to the release.\n\u201cBy bringing together leading developers, scientists, academic institutions, companies and other innovators, we\u2019ll pool resources and knowledge to address safety concerns while providing a platform for sharing and developing solutions that fit the needs of researchers, developers and adopters around the world,\u201d the release reads.\nThe AI Alliance\u2019s initial cohort is exceptionally broad \u2014 sitting at the intersection of not just AI and enterprise but healthcare, silicon and software-as-a-service as well. In addition to academic partners such as the University of Tokyo, UC Berkeley, the University of Illinois, Cornell and the aforementioned Imperial College London and Yale, Sony, ServiceNow, the National Science Foundation, NASA, Oracle, the Cleveland Clinic and Dell have pledged their participation in some form.\nMLCommons, the engineering consortium behind MLPerf, the benchmarking suite used by major chip manufacturers to evaluate their hardware\u2019s AI performance, is also a founding AI Alliance member. So are LangChain and LlamaIndex, two creators behind some of the more widely used tools and frameworks for building apps powered by text-generating AI models.\nBut without the participation of so many major AI industry players \u2014 and lacking deadlines or even concrete objectives \u2014 can the AI Alliance succeed? What would success look like, even?\nBeats me.\nThe vast number of competing interests \u2014 from healthcare networks (Cleveland Clinic) to insurance providers (Roadzen) \u2014 won\u2019t make it easy for the Alliance\u2019s members to coalesce around a single, united front. And for all their talk of openness, IBM and Meta aren\u2019t exactly the poster children for the future that the Alliance\u2019s release depicts \u2014 casting doubt on their sincerity.\nPerhaps I\u2019m wrong and the AI Alliance will be a smash success. Or perhaps it\u2019ll crumble under mistrust and its own bureaucracy. We\u2019ll see; time will tell.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Wiggers, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-05 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":268}
{"title":"YouTube influencer who gave parenting advice pleads guilty to horrific child abuse","context":"## YouTube influencer who gave parenting advice pleads guilty to horrific child abuse\n\nA Utah mother of six who gave parenting advice on YouTube pleaded guilty Monday to child abuse charges and will go to prison for trying to convince her two youngest children they were evil, possessed and needed to be punished to repent.\nRuby Franke stood shackled in gray and white jail clothing as she closed her eyes and took a deep breath before pleading guilty to each of her first three charges. On the fourth, she fought back some emotion before saying: \u201cWith my deepest regret and sorrow for my family and my children, guilty.\u201d\nJudge John J. Walton scheduled sentencing for Feb. 20 after accepting the plea agreement, which described new details of the abuse the children endured, including the claims that they were possessed. Under the plea agreement, Franke agreed to serve a prison term and the sentences will run consecutively. Sentencing would be up to the judge.\nFranke pleaded not guilty to two other counts, court records said, and was returned to custody after the hearing.\nUnder Utah law, second-degree aggravated child abuse can be charged if that person knowingly or intentionally inflicts serious physical injury to a child or causes or permits another to inflict serious physical injury to their child. Each charge carries a sentence of one to 15 years in prison.\nWinward Law said in a statement Friday that the abuse occurred while Franke was influenced by a relationship counselor who led her to \u201ca distorted sense of morality.\u201d\n\u201cRuby Franke is a devoted mother and is also a woman committed to constant improvement,\u201d Winward Law said in a statement. Franke initially believed that her co-defendant Jodi Hildebrandt \u201chad the insight to offer a path to continual improvement,\u201d but said that Hildebrandt \u201ctook advantage of this quest and twisted it into something heinous.\u201d\nIn the plea agreement, Franke admits that she tortured her son from May 22 through Aug. 30 by forcing him into hours of physical tasks, summer work outdoors without adequate water and \u201crepeated and serious sunburns\u201d that blistered. He was denied food or given very plain meals, and he was isolated from other people without access to books, notebooks or electronics.\nAfter he tried to run away in July, his hands and feet were regularly bound, sometimes with handcuffs.\nAt times, ropes were used to tie together handcuffs that secured his hands and feet as he lay on his stomach, lifting his arms and legs off the ground and injuring his wrists and ankles, the plea agreement said.\nFranke also admitted to kicking her son while wearing boots, holding his head under water and smothering his mouth and nose with her hands, according to the plea agreement.\n\u201cHe was also told that everything that was being done to him were acts of love,\u201d the agreement states.\nFranke acknowledged similarly abusing her 9-year-old daughter by forcing her to work outside, run on dirt roads barefoot, and go without food and water.\n\u201cShe was also repeatedly told she was evil and possessed, the punishments were necessary for her to be obedient and repent, and these things were being done to her in order to help her,\u201d the plea agreement said. The girl \u201cwas convinced\u201d what her mother said was true, the agreement said.\nFranke and Hildebrandt were arrested on Aug. 30 after Franke\u2019s 12-year-old son escaped from Hildebrandt\u2019s house in the southern Utah city of Ivins and asked a neighbor to call police, according to the 911 call released by the St. George Police Department.\nThe boy was emaciated and had duct tape around his ankles and wrists but wouldn\u2019t say why, the caller reported.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been \u2026 he\u2019s been detained,\u201d the caller said, his voice breaking up. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously covered in wounds.\u201d\nThe boy and Franke\u2019s daughter, who was also found at Hildebrandt\u2019s house, were taken to the hospital. Eventually, Franke\u2019s four youngest children were taken into state custody.\nFranke and Hildebrandt were each charged with six felony counts of aggravated child abuse. They have remained jailed since their arrests.\nDuring Franke\u2019s incarceration, \u201cshe has actively engaged in an introspection that has allowed her to reset her moral compass and understand the full weight of her actions. Ms. Franke is committed to taking responsibility for the part she played in the events leading up to her incarceration,\u201d the statement said.\nThe boy told investigators that \u201cJodi\u201d put the ropes on his ankles and wrists and that they used cayenne pepper and honey to dress the wounds caused by the ropes, according to a search warrant.\nHildebrandt has agreed not to see patients until the allegations are addressed by state licensing officials. Her next court hearing is set for Dec. 27, according to court records. Her attorney, Douglas Terry, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on the allegations made against Hildebrandt in the statement by Franke\u2019s attorney.\nThe Franke family was criticized online for its \u201c8 Passengers\u201d video blog showing parenting decisions including banning their oldest son from his bedroom for seven months for pranking his younger brother. In other videos, Ruby Franke talked about refusing to take lunch to a kindergartener who forgot it at home and threatening to cut the head off a young girl\u2019s stuffed toy to punish her for cutting things in the house.\nIn one video, Franke said she and her husband told their two youngest children that they would not be getting presents from Santa Claus one year because they had been selfish and weren\u2019t responding to punishment like being kept home from school and cleaning the floorboards.\nThe YouTube channel, which started in 2015, ended after seven years.\nFranke\u2019s husband, Kevin Franke, has filed for divorce.\n\nThis article, authored by Amy Beth Hanson, The Associated Press, was published by Fortune on 2023-12-18 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":269}

Longfellow's son Charlie was critically injured fighting for the Union army near Washington, D.C.\nSo on that day, the sound of the church bells heralding Christmas seemed to mock the very thought of \"peace on Earth.\"\nYet through his personal grief and the torment of a war that would claim nearly a million lives, Longfellow penned his famous poem that has become a Christmas carol for the ages, \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.\"\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO RODE WASHINGTON ACROSS THE DELAWARE ON CHRISTMAS, SAILOR-SOLDIER JOHN GLOVER\nEach stanza of Longfellow's poem ends with \"peace on Earth, good will to men.\"\nModern readers living in a post-women's rights world shouldn't take offense at the \"good will to men.\"\nThe poem takes the reader on a journey from how the bells herald the mirth in the traditions surrounding Christmas.\nOne, it's referring to mankind \u2014 humanity \u2014 not specifically the male gender. And two, it's based on the King James translation of the Bible, of Luke 2:14: \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will toward men.\"\nThe poem takes the reader on a journey from how the bells herald the mirth in the traditions surrounding Christmas: \"Their old, familiar carols play\/And wild and sweet.\"\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO PLANTED THE FIRST CHRISTMAS TREE FARM: NEW JERSEY ENTREPRENEUR W. V. MCGALLIARD\nThe words then repeat \"Of peace on earth, good-will to men!\" through the start of war and the blasts of bombs.\nThen from each black, accursed mouth\nThe cannon thundered in the South,\nAnd with the sound\nThe carols drowned\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\nIt then questions God's existence and omnipotence.\nAnd in despair I bowed my head;\n\"There is no peace on earth,\" I said;\n\"For hate is strong,\nAnd mocks the song\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\"\nFinally, through the din, it lets the bells speak of that one great truth.\nThen pealed the bells more loud and deep:\n\"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;\nThe Wrong shall fail,\nThe Right prevail,\nWith peace on earth, good-will to men.\"\nOne of our great misfortunes today comes from not letting the carols of Christmas take their rightful place of importance.\nAdvertisers use them to sell products and so we miss their true meaning. A phone company's radio ad uses \"Joy to the World\" to hype a new phone plan.\nAT CHRISTMAS, DON MCLEAN SINGS THE PRAISES OF \u2018SILENT NIGHT,' OTHER HOLIDAY CLASSICS: \u2018MY MOTHER\u2019S FAVORITE'\nInstead of \"The Lord is come, let heaven and earth rejoice\" \u2014 we now hear how much better one company's wireless plan is over another.\nHow can a hurting world know joy's powerful message of hope for a darkened world when marketing takes precedence over the words, \"He rules the world with truth and grace, No more let sin and sorrow grow ... He comes to make His blessings flow, far as the curse is found.\"\nThe most popular Christmas carol used in marketing ads is \"Carol of the Bells.\"\nFew know its original rhythmic lyrics: \"Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells, all seem to say, throw cares away, Christmas is here, bringing good cheer, to young and old, meek and the bold.\"\nCHRISTMAS MUSIC IS 'ETERNAL, ALMOST LIKE PRAYERS': RAYMOND ARROYO'S NEW PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS CHERISHED FAVORITES\nEach stanza is punctuated by the sounds of \"ding, dong, ding, dong.\"\nAlthough its lyrics make no deep theological statement about the birth of Jesus, according to GodTube, the biblical inspiration for \"Carol of the Bells\" has Old Testament roots.\n\"Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells, all seem to say, throw cares away, Christmas is here, bringing good cheer, to young and old, meek and the bold.\"\nHere is Zechariah 14:20: \"And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u2018Holy to the Lord.\u2019 And the pots in the house of the Lord shall be as the bowls before the altar.\"\nThe verses in Exodus 28:33-35 talk about the bells ringing on Aaron's robe as he ministers in the holy place before the Lord.\nAnd Psalm 150 says, \"Let everything that has breath, praise the Lord.\"\nPopular Christmas songs have their place, including wonderful tunes like \"Silver Bells,\" \"White Christmas\" and \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire).\"\nVIRAL POST EXPLAINS THE \u2018REAL\u2019 STORY BEHIND RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER\nEven songs about Rudolph, and Frosty the snowman, and walking in a winter wonderland all warm our hearts during the holidays.\nBut it is only in carols that we truly understand Christmas \u2014 of the joy at the birth of Jesus, and also the somberness of what Jesus was born to do: to die.\nA good example is \"What Child Is This,\" which brings joy and sorrow poignantly together as it sees the beauty and innocence of a tiny babe asleep on His mother's lap: \"What child is this who lays to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping.\"\nYet it still sings of the future sorrow: \"Nails, spears, shall pierce Him through, the cross be born for me for you. Hail, hail the Word made flesh, the babe, the Son of Mary.\"\nThat Jesus was born to die for our sins, to breach the chasm between God and humanity, is the joy and sorrow of this season.\nMEANINGFUL WAYS TO NAVIGATE THE HOLIDAY SEASON IF YOU'RE NOT IN A FESTIVE SPIRIT\nThere is joy because He left His glory aside to live among us, abide with us, live the life we couldn't live.\nAnd there is sorrow because our sin, the curse, was and is so great that God Himself took the wrath of his own judgment \u2014 and died the death we deserve.\nCarols make sense of why there are still wars and suffering at Christmas. Carols express that the world isn't the way it should be, but they give us tremendous hope in what it could be.\nThe carol \"O come O come Emanuel\" is a mournful tune, almost funereal. Yet its refrain pleads, \"Rejoice, Rejoice!\"\nWhy? Because \"Emanuel, shall come to thee, oh Israel.\"\nEmanuel means \"God with us.\" That means because of Christmas, a new, category-busting power has come into the world, one not available for the tens of thousands of years of human existence before.\nGrace and a love that surpasses all understanding is what became available because of Christmas.\nThe story of Longfellow's famous poem is now the subject of a feature-length film, \"I Heard the Bells,\" available on demand through most cable and streaming platforms.\nTo an age of AI and computer technology, a little story about a 19th century poet may seem anachronistic.\nLongfellow's poem still bears the truth because it was based on divine reality.\nBut bestselling author and nationally syndicated columnist Cal Thomas notes that from his standpoint, things never really change.\nSaid Thomas, \"You can change hairstyles, clothes, styles, modes of transportation. You can even change politicians. But nothing really seems to change \u2026 A lot of that has to do with human nature.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nLongfellow's poem still bears the truth because it was based on divine reality.\nYes, hate is strong \u2014 but God's love is stronger.\nWars do bring death \u2014 but God through Jesus Christ has conquered death.\nAnd because God is now \"with us,\" there is hope ... even with a broken heart.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAnd there is triumph even amid tragedy.\nThis Christmas Day, strain your ears, push aside the din of the culture, the city, the war, the pain \u2026 and hear the bells.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Lifestyle on 2023-12-23 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":270}
{"title":"NMPA: Generative AI is \u2018the greatest risk to the human creative class that has ever existed\u2019","context":"## NMPA: Generative AI is \u2018the greatest risk to the human creative class that has ever existed\u2019\n\nMBW Reacts is a series of analytical commentaries from Music Business Worldwide written in response to major recent entertainment events or news stories. MBW Reacts is supported by JKBX , a technology platform that offers consumers access to music royalties as an asset class.\nLegislators and regulators around the world are grappling with how to address the many issues that have emerged since AI technology \u201cwent mainstream\u201d about a year ago.\nIn the US, one of the key efforts on that front is being spearheaded by the US Copyright Office, which this past summer issued a call for submissions on the issue of AI and copyright. The goal is for the USCO to put together a study to \u201dhelp assess whether legislative or regulatory steps in this area are warranted.\u201d\nNumerous businesses involved in AI, and those with substantial copyright holdings, have submitted their thoughts on the issue, including Universal Music Group and AI developer Anthropic.\nHowever, to get the clearest view of the direction the music industry would like to see things head, it might help to read the submission from the National Music Publishers Association (NMPA).\nThe NMPA\u2019s submission, dated October 30, 2023, pulls no punches.\nIt starts off by stressing that its membership \u2013 US music publishers major and independent \u2013 are \u201cnot opposed\u201d to AI.\n\u201cThere is widespread belief in the music industry that great benefits could come from generative AI systems that can assist human creators,\u201d the NMPA states.\nBut then it goes for the jugular: \u201cHowever, the development of the generative AI marketplace is marked by breathtaking speed, size and complexity. Hindsight may well prove that there is no hyperbole in saying that generative AI is the greatest risk to the human creative class that has ever existed.\u201d\n\u201cHindsight may well prove that there is no hyperbole in saying that generative AI is the greatest risk to the human creative class that has ever existed.\u201d NMPA\nThe submission adds: \u201cEven more alarming is that we do not know how long the window is to act before it is too late. We therefore implore the [US Copyright] Office to support proactive protections for human creators and, where there is uncertainty, to err on the side of protecting human creators.\u201d\nThat position might not come as a complete surprise from the NMPA, which earlier this year joined the fledgling Human Artistry Campaign, whose goal \u2013 in broadest terms \u2013 is to ensure that AI doesn\u2019t replace or \u201cerode\u201d human culture.\nYet the NMPA\u2019s submission is hardly a Luddite diatribe against high tech; rather, it advocates for regulations and principles that it sees as the right approach to ensuring that the interests of musical artists \u2013 and music rights holders \u2013 don\u2019t end up subjugated in the frenzy to build our brave new AI-powered world.\nHere are some of the key arguments the MNPA made in its submission\u2026\n1. Works created principally through AI should not be copyrightable\nIn the view of the NMPA, simply giving a prompt to a AI music generator \u2013 \u201ccompose a power ballad about falling in love\u201d \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be enough to create a copyrightable work.\n\u201cPolicies surrounding copyrightability of AI-generated content will either serve to incentivize continued investment and effort into human creativity or to disincentivize it,\u201d states the submission, which can be read in full here.\n\u201cThe law should never be such that human creators stand to gain more from repeatedly clicking a button to generate massive amounts of AI-produced materials than from putting their hearts, souls, experiences, skills, talents, and emotions into expressive works of art.\u201d\nThe law should treat a musical work created entirely by AI the same way it treats works that are in the public domain, the NMPA argues \u2013 not copyrightable, and free for anyone to use as they see fit, whether for commercial or other purposes.\nBut the submission draws a clear distinction between music generated by AI, and music generated with the help of AI.\n\u201cWhere creators use AI technology as a tool in the creative process to make works that represent their original authorship, their works should be entitled to protection under copyright law,\u201d the NMPA states.\n\u201cCreators that use AI to refine, recast, or modify, or to create new derivative works based on their preexisting works, may also have legitimate claims of authorship over the resulting work in some circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cThe law should never be such that human creators stand to gain more from repeatedly clicking a button to generate massive amounts of AI-produced materials than from putting their hearts, souls, experiences, skills, talents, and emotions into expressive works of art.\u201d NMPA\nIn this regard, US legal precedent is \u2013 at least so far \u2013 on the NMPA\u2019s side.\nIn a recent court case, an individual by the name of Stephen Thaler, who owns a computer system he calls the \u201cCreativity Machine,\u201d had a copyright application for an AI-generated \u201cpainting\u201d rejected by the USCO on the grounds that the Creativity Machine had created it.\nIn a ruling this past August, a US District Court in Washington, D.C., sided with the Copyright Office.\n\u201cCopyright has never stretched so far\u2026 as to protect works generated by new forms of technology operating absent any guiding human hand, as plaintiff urges here,\u201d Judge Beryl A. Howell commented. \u201cHuman authorship is a bedrock requirement of copyright.\u201d\n2. AI developers should be required to license materials and keep records of the materials they use for training\nMany key players in the music industry and beyond have been adamant that using copyrighted works to train AI algorithms without authorization is a copyright infringement, and a number of lawsuits have been launched against AI companies on these grounds.\nOne such lawsuit was filed by Universal Music Group, Concord Music Group and ABKCO against AI developer Anthropic, seeking potentially tens of millions of dollars for the alleged \u201csystematic and widespread infringement of their copyrighted song lyrics.\u201d\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean key music industry players don\u2019t want their materials ever used to train AI \u2013 they just want AI developers to license that music, not unlike how streaming services, bars and restaurants or movie producers license music.\n\u201cLicensing musical works before training use is both required and practicable,\u201d the NMPA\u2019s submission states, adding that \u201cthere are well developed processes in place for technology ventures to obtain free market licenses on a large scale.\u201d\nAnd indeed it would have to be on a \u201clarge scale,\u201d given that AI algorithms such as large language models are trained on countless millions or even billions of pieces of digital data.\n\u201cTransparency and recordkeeping requirements are needed to disincentivize infringing activity and to support enforcement activities by copyright owners.\u201d NMPA\nThe NMPA notes that work on licensing \u201cis already underway,\u201d pointing to news reports earlier this year that UMG, along with Warner Music Group, are in talks with Google to secure licenses for artists\u2019 vocals and musical melodies to create AI-generated songs.\nHowever, enforcing copyright when it comes to AI algorithms could be exceedingly difficult for rights holders, a point the NMPA makes repeatedly in its submission: \u201cReverse-engineering\u201d an AI algorithm to prove it was trained on content to which the developer had no right is no easy task, save for when that AI produces a work that is substantially similar to the original (as in the case of the lawsuits currently pending against AI companies).\nSo the NMPA is arguing for a new regulation: That AI developers be required to keep records of what data their algorithms ingested.\n\u201cTransparency and recordkeeping requirements are needed to disincentivize infringing activity and to support enforcement activities by copyright owners,\u201d the NMPA\u2019s submission states.\n\u201cThe primary parties who should be required to maintain records under a transparency and recordkeeping scheme are developers of AI models, those who use existing AI models to develop new AI tools and those who broker datasets for use in AI training.\u201d\nOn that front, the European Union may have gone some \u2013 if not all \u2013 of the way in making that a reality. Its proposed AI Act \u2013 currently the subject of back-and-forth negotiations between the European Commission and the European Parliament \u2013 contains a rule that would require AI developers to disclose whether their AI had been trained on copyrighted materials.\nTransparency in the use of AI is also becoming a rule on social media sites where AI-generated content is likely to appear: Both TikTok and YouTube have now passed rules requiring AI-generated content to be labeled as such.\n3. The NMPA is opposed to an \u2018opt-out\u2019 regime for use of copyrighted works in AI\nOne of the questions the US Copyright Office posed in its call for submissions was \u201cshould copyright owners have to affirmatively consent (opt in) to the use of their works for training [AI], or should they be provided with the means to object (opt out)?\u201d\nThe NMPA made it clear it\u2019s on the side of \u201copt in.\u201d\n\u201cUS copyright law is an opt-in system,\u201d the NMPA said. \u201cOpt-out regimes fundamentally undermine copyright protections by shifting the burden to obtain a license away from users.\u201d\nThe submission continued: \u201cAn opt-out scheme that requires rights holders to opt out on an AI company-by-AI company or application-by-application basis would not be feasible, given the sheer volume of AI companies and applications; it is nearly a full-time job to keep up with developments in the AI marketplace\u2026 Copyright owners, particularly individual creators and small businesses could not possibly meet such a burden.\n\u201cNMPA strongly opposes consideration of such a measure.\u201d\n\u201cOpt-out regimes fundamentally undermine copyright protections by shifting the burden to obtain a license away from users.\u201d NMPA\nOn this issue, the NMPA is fully aligned with UMG, which made a similar argument in its own submission to the Copyright Office.\n\u201cAn opt-out system is based on the erroneous premise that training on copyrighted works without permission is by default lawful unless each copyright owner objects,\u201d UMG stated in its submission.\n\u201cThat philosophy does violence to basic principles of copyright law, imposes undue burdens on copyright owners, creates the wrong incentives for AI developers, and is neither practicable nor effective for protecting the rights of copyright owners or ensuring the sensible use of copyrighted works for training purposes.\u201d\n4. Training AI on copyrighted works is not \u201cfair use\u201d under almost any circumstance\nAnother area in which the NMPA and UMG are aligned is on the issue of whether using copyrighted material constitutes \u201cfair use.\u201d\nFair use is the carve-out to copyright law that allows copyrighted materials to be used without permission in certain limited circumstances, such as for educational purposes or for reporting news.\nFirst, a quick reminder on the test US courts use to determine fair use, which has four factors:\nThe purpose and character of the use \u2013 is the use of the copyrighted work for educational purposes or for commercial purposes?\nThe nature of the copyrighted work \u2013 whether or not the work is particularly creative and original.\nThe amount and substantiality of the portion taken \u2013 just how much of a copyrighted work was used without permission?\nThe effect of the use on the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work.\nThe NMPA\u2019s submission argues that the way AI developers use materials to train AI would fail every one of these tests for determining fair use.\nAI algorithms are not used for non-profit or educational purposes, as \u201cthe training of AI models is fundamentally a commercial endeavor, especially in the case of generative AI,\u201d the NMPA stated.\n\u201cAI can be used to generate works that compete in the marketplace with the copied works, thereby reducing revenue from existing licensing markets.\u201d NMPA\nFurthermore, it contends that any argument that an AI algorithm was trained on copyrighted material for \u201cnoncommercial\u201d or \u201cresearch\u201d purposes should be \u201cviewed skeptically.\u201d\nAny business could claim it\u2019s training AI for research or non-commercial purposes, \u201cthen shift entirely to commercial exploitation, leaving the creators of the copied works with no compensation,\u201d the submission argued.\nAI training also fails the fair use test on the second factor, as generative AI can be used to create \u201cexpressive\u201d works of music, and on the third, given that AI training means the entirety of a copyrighted work is ingested, \u201calthough there is no inherent need for that,\u201d the NMPA states.\nAI training also fails the final test because \u201cAI can be used to generate works that compete in the marketplace with the copied works, thereby reducing revenue from existing licensing markets as well,\u201d the NMPA stated.\nThe issue of fair use could prove to be one of the key battlegrounds between AI developers and copyright holders. In its own submission to the Copyright Office, Anthropic argued that using copyrighted works to train AI is, indeed, fair use.\nThe copying of copyrighted works to feed it into the AI algorithm \u201cis merely an intermediate step, extracting unprotectable elements about the entire corpus of works, in order to create new outputs,\u201d Anthropic stated.\n\u201cIn this way, the use of the original copyrighted work is non-expressive; that is, it is not re-using the copyrighted expression to communicate it to users\u2026 To the extent copyrighted works are used in training data, it is for analysis (of statistical relationships between words and concepts) that is unrelated to any expressive purpose of the work.\u201d\n\u201cThis sort of transformative use has been recognized as lawful in the past and should continue to be considered lawful in this case.\u201d\nThat argument could yet come into play in Anthropic\u2019s legal battle with Universal.\nAnd given the high stakes involved \u2013 for the music industry, for the tech industry and for the shape of culture going forward \u2013 that case, along with the US Copyright Office\u2019s study of AI and copyright, are worth keeping a close eye on.\nJKBX (pronounced \"Jukebox\") unlocks shared value from things people love by offering consumers access to music as an asset class \u2014 it calls them Royalty Shares.

{"title":"Creatives across industries are strategizing together around AI concerns","context":"## Creatives across industries are strategizing together around AI concerns\n\nAs creative industries grapple with AI\u2019s explosion into every artistic medium at once, separate calls from artists warning the world to take action before it\u2019s too late are starting to converge. From fake Drake songs to stylized Instagram profile pictures, art conjured with newly sophisticated AI tools is suddenly ubiquitous \u2014 and so are conversations about how to rein in the technology before it does irrevocable harm to creative communities.\nThis week, digital rights organization Fight for the Future partnered with music industry labor group United Musicians and Allied Workers to launch #AIdayofaction, a campaign that calls on Congress to block corporations from obtaining copyrights on music and other art made with AI.\nThe idea is that by preventing industry behemoths like major record labels, for example, from copyrighting music made with the assistance of AI, those companies will be forced to keep looping humans into the creative process. But those same concerns \u2014 and the same potential strategies for pushing back against the onslaught of AI \u2014 exist across creative industries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because if you\u2019ve talked to musicians who have these concerns, they say, \u2018Well, authors have been very quiet.\u2019 If you talk to others about these concerns, they say, \u2018Well, musicians and photographers don\u2019t seem to care at all,\u2019\u201d Fight for the Future Campaigns and Communications director Lia Holland told TechCrunch. \u201cSo part of it also is that the different creative fields, when it comes to this sort of work, are a little bit siloed.\u201d\n\u201cThat was another intent with our launching this effort with the day of action, to try to illustrate how these are common concerns that are shared across artistic mediums. And to create an organizing point . . . because when artists of different mediums move together they have a lot more power.\u201d\nThe campaign targets potential corporate abuse of AI technology, but it\u2019s realistic about the ways that musicians and some other creatives could benefit on an individual level from automating parts of their work. The goal is that AI tools \u201cbecome ways for individual humans to make more money, work less, and compete with the corporations that exploit them.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting from a music perspective, specifically, because . . . musicians are perhaps more familiar with the idea of AI,\u201d Holland said. \u201cMusicians in general are more familiar with things like music production software, and AI tools like MIDI drum loops . . . so I think that there is a certain amount of more progressive learning from them, when it comes to technology, and its ability to make their music better.\u201d\nWhen it comes to art and AI, the conversation is complicated, to say the least. Musicians are nervous about industry giants copyrighting AI music and cutting them out of the process. Major record labels are worried about AI models training on their catalogues and stealing a slice of their considerable pie. Spotify erased thousands of AI-crafted songs from its platform but also recently globally launched an AI-powered DJ that curates music for listeners while talking to them in a synthetic voice.\n\u201cThe training of generative AI using our artists\u2019 music . . . begs the question as to which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation,\u201d Universal Music Group said after a song using AI to imitate Drake and The Weeknd, two of its artists, went viral.\nThese same conversations and contradictions are manifesting across creative industries, but artists themselves don\u2019t always have a seat at the table. Independent artists in particular are learning that their voices resonate louder when coming together across disciplines to push back against what Holland describes as an \u201cextraordinary spectrum of exploitation\u201d that leverages their work.\nIn a roundtable hosted by the FTC this week, the agency brought together figures from across creative industries \u2014 from voice acting and science fiction to screenwriting, music, illustration and even fashion \u2014 to delve into how generative AI is affecting creatives.\n\u201cI know that generative AI in particular poses a unique set of opportunities and challenges to creative industries,\u201d FTC chair Lina Khan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already heard significant concerns about how these technologies could virtually overnight significantly disempower creators and artists who may watch their life\u2019s creation be appropriated into models over which they have no control.\u201d\nIn the comments, representatives from myriad creative communities expressed concerns around opt-out requirements that by default train AI models on artists\u2019 original work, and how existing copyright law could be a useful if not comprehensive tool for setting out regulatory guardrails.\nIn the conversation, a representative with the WGA emphasized that while striking writers obtained their own protections in a newly won agreement, the fight for artists\u2019 livelihoods \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop at the bargaining table.\u201d\nWhether Congress mobilizes in time to address mounting concerns around AI and creative industries or not, for its part the FTC does appear to be very tuned into the technology\u2019s risks \u2014 and the power of bringing voices together across industries.\n\u201cArt is fundamentally human,\u201d FTC commissioner Rebecca Slaughter said.\n\u201cHumans may use technology to assist in creating art, but something cannot be art without human input. Technology is, by definition, not human . . . humans may endeavor to make generative AI that is ever more intelligent, [but] it cannot and will not replace human creativity.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Taylor Hatmaker, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-06 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":272}
{"title":"Showtime Boxing to take final 10-count: Top 5 greatest fights revisited","context":"## Showtime Boxing to take final 10-count: Top 5 greatest fights revisited\n\nWhen Cuban super middleweight David Morrell steps between the ropes to defend his WBA \"regular\" super middleweight title against Sena Agbeko at the Armory in Minneapolis, there will be a lump in many ringsider's throats.\nHowever, it's not the main event that will elicit this emotional response, it's the fact that December 16, 2023, will be the final broadcast of the beloved Showtime Championship Boxing series.\nShowtime Boxing began in 1986 and has hosted some of the greatest and most famous fighters of all time, including Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns, Roberto Duran, Sugar Ray Leonard, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and Floyd Mayweather.\nAmong the elite-level professionals who have contributed in a broadcasting capacity are Tim Ryan, Gil Clancy, Al Bernstein, Steve Farhood, Barry Tompkins, Jim Gray, Mauro Ranallo and many others. The platform has been an institution and will be greatly missed.\n\u201cThe company\u2019s decision is not a reflection of the work we have done in recent years, nor of our long and proud history,\u201d said Showtime Sports executive Stephen Espinoza in a statement to staff.\n\u201cUnfortunately, in a rapidly evolving media marketplace, the company has had to make difficult choices allocating resources, resetting priorities, and reshaping its content offering. While today\u2019s news is certainly difficult and disappointing, it is entirely out of our control.\u201d\nMORE: Breakdown of Paramount shutting Showtime Sports\nEspinoza couldn\u2019t be more right in relation to the \u201clong and proud history\u201d of the company. Thanks to Showtime Boxing, fight fans have been treated to some of the greatest moments in the sport\u2019s history and that should never be forgotten.\nJust as was the case when HBO departed from boxing in 2018, the achievements of the fighters, as well as the individuals who gave them the platform to perform, should be celebrated.\nThe Sporting News now looks back at Showtime Boxing\u2019s five greatest fights.\nMarvelous Marvin Hagler vs. John Mugabi\nDate: March 10, 1986\nMarch 10, 1986 Location: Caesars Palace, Las Vegas\nCaesars Palace, Las Vegas World titles: Undisputed middleweight\nHow about this for an intro? Hagler vs. Mugabi was Showtime Boxing\u2019s maiden broadcast and they hit the ground running with one of the greatest middleweight championship fights of the modern era.\nComing off his stunning third-round knockout triumph over Thomas Hearns in April 1985, Hagler was the best fighter in the world and, at long last, an authentic superstar. After 11 months off \u2013 his longest period of inactivity by far \u2013 \u201cThe Marvelous One\u201d had a taste for blood and returned to action with a vengeance.\nJohn \u201cThe Best\u201d Mugabi had earned his ring moniker. The Uganda-born power-puncher had a perfect record \u2013 26 fights, 26 wins, 26 knockouts, with 10 of those stoppages coming in the first round. The challenger was moving from super welterweight to middleweight, but he'd carried his power up with him and he was hungry.\nMugabi got off to a great start, blasting Hagler with some horrific power shots in the early rounds. However, the more experienced Hagler made the necessary adjustments and began punishing his man heavily in the sixth. Mugabi gave it everything he had, but Hagler ended matters in the eleventh with a succession of crunching rights.\nResult: Hagler KO 11\nRoberto Duran vs. Iran Barkley\nDate: February 24, 1989\nFebruary 24, 1989 Location: Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey\nConvention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey World titles: WBC middleweight\nThis one had the makings of a 'passing of the torch' moment.\nDuran was 37 years old and hadn\u2019t scored a significant victory since posting an eighth-round stoppage of Davey Moore for the WBA super welterweight title in June 1983. In five and a half years, Duran had posted seven wins against three losses and he\u2019d looked a shell of himself in a split decision victory over the unheralded Jeff Lanas in his most recent fight.\nMeanwhile, the 28-year-old Barkley had already conquered one of The Four Kings when he spectacularly knocked out Thomas Hearns in three rounds to win the WBC middleweight title.\nThis result was foreboding for Duran fans who once watched Hearns obliterate their hero in two rounds. Barkley was a natural middleweight and at 6-1, he towered over the 5-7 Duran.\nNever write off an all-time great. Motivated by the chance to become the first Hispanic fighter to win four world titles in as many weight classes, Duran had whipped himself into excellent fighting shape.\nThe ex-champ stunned Barkley with a right in the opening round, absorbed everything the champion could throw, and punctuated an astonishing performance with a pulverizing combination knockdown in round 11. It was close, but Duran took the decision and the championship.\nResult: Duran SD 12\nMike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield 1\nDate: November 9, 1996\nNovember 9, 1996 Location: MGM Grand, Las Vegas\nMGM Grand, Las Vegas World titles: WBA heavyweight\nIn the early 1990s, this was considered the biggest heavyweight title matchup since Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier clashed two decades earlier. But when Tyson was jailed for rape in 1992, the division was forced to move on without him.\nWhile Tyson was incarcerated, Holyfield\u2019s career went through peaks and troughs. He lost his championship to Riddick Bowe in one of the greatest heavyweight title fights of all time but regained it in a rematch. However, a loss to Moorer, a second defeat to Bowe, and an underwhelming win over Bobby Czyz had many convinced that \u201cThe Real Deal\u201d was shot.\nTyson was released in March 1995 and quickly resumed his reign of terror. Just seven months into his comeback, the ex-champ regained the WBC title by stopping Britain\u2019s Frank Bruno in three rounds and then splatted Bruce Seldon in one to pick up the WBA version.\n\u201cThe Baddest Man on the Planet\u201d was back and everyone was terrified. Well, almost everyone.\nOn fight night, Holyfield, unlike the vast majority of Tyson's opponents, came to the ring with a smile on his face. The challenger wasn\u2019t intimidated by the Tyson mystique and turned in the greatest performance of his career.\nHolyfield was dominant throughout, decked Tyson in round six, and put the finishing touches on an epic triumph in round 11.\nResult: Holyfield TKO 11\nMORE: My Sweetest Victory: Evander Holyfield reveals secret to beating Mike Tyson\nDiego Corrales vs. Jose Luis Castillo 1\nDate: May 7, 2005\nMay 7, 2005 Location: Mandalay Bay Events Centre, Las Vegas\nMandalay Bay Events Centre, Las Vegas World titles: WBC, WBO, Ring Magazine lightweight\nCorrales had reestablished his image after being outclassed by Floyd Mayweather in 2001. While \u201cChico\u201d had fallen short against the excellent Joel Casamayor, he\u2019d avenged that defeat to pick up the vacant WBO super featherweight crown. Upon moving up to lightweight, Corrales took on WBO champ Acelino Frietas and came from behind to score a dramatic stoppage.\nCastillo also had a history with Mayweather. In fact, many fans believe that the Mexican star deserved to win a decision against him in April 2002. However, when Mayweather won the rematch decisively, Castillo, like Corrales, was forced to rebuild and he did so courtesy of excellent wins over Juan Lazcano, Casamayor, and Julio Diaz. The Lazcano triumph gave Castillo the vacant WBC title.\nCorrales vs. Castillo was one of the greatest fights in history. Despite having functional height and reach advantages, Corrales elected to meet Castillo on the inside and the action was incredible.\nIn the 10th, Castillo decked his man with a sharp left hook, then put him over again with another left. Following both knockdowns, \u201cChico\u201d had spat out his mouthpiece for which he received a point deduction.\nBattered and woozy, his left eye almost closed, Corrales needed a miracle. He found it.\nWhen the bout resumed, Corrales nailed his man with a hard right and an even harder left. Castillo wilted and was stopped seconds later by a savage, head-snapping assault. There\u2019s been nothing like it since.\nResult: Corrales TKO 10\nIsrael Vazquez vs. Rafael Marquez 3\nDate: March 1, 2008\nMarch 1, 2008 Location: Home Depot Centre, Carson, California\nHome Depot Centre, Carson, California World titles: WBC and Ring Magazine super bantamweight\nCriminally overlooked, it\u2019s arguable that Mexicans Israel Vazquez and Rafael Marquez turned in the most consistently exciting trilogy in modern boxing history. Yes, there was an ill-advised part four, won by Marquez, but this was and always will be a trilogy.\nWhile Ali-Frazier II, Gatti-Ward II, and Barrera-Morales II didn\u2019t live up to acts I and III of those fistic plays, Vazquez and Marquez produced three back-to-back classics that will forever stand the test of time.\nThe only reason the first encounter, which was won by Marquez, wasn\u2019t awarded Fight of the Year 2007 was because it was beaten out by the rematch, which was won by Vazquez, the same year. The third encounter was the best of the series and took Fight of the Year for 2008.\nAs was the case in fights one and three, the ebb and flow of the bout was incredible. Both men traded hellacious combinations throughout and Vazquez hit the canvas in round four.\nThe superior speed and timing of Marquez was carrying the day but Vazquez slowly battled his way back and was aided further when his rival was deducted a point for a low blow in round 10.\nBut it was the 12th and final round that took this fight into the stratosphere. Desperate for a big finish, Vazquez nailed his countryman in the closing seconds and only the ropes held Marquez up.\nRuled a knockdown, this crucial moment gave Vazquez the split decision win and saw him retain his championships. It doesn\u2019t get any better.\nResult: Vazquez SD 12\nMORE: Sporting News' top 12 pound-for-pound boxers\n\nThis article, authored by Tom Gray, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-18 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":273}
{"title":"Truth Behind Jake Paul Dating Dillon Danis\u2019 Ex-girlfriend: Did MMA Star Break Up With Savannah Montano?","context":"## Truth Behind Jake Paul Dating Dillon Danis\u2019 Ex-girlfriend: Did MMA Star Break Up With Savannah Montano?\n\nDillon Danis has been going back and forth with the Paul family long before his upcoming fight against Logan Paul, scheduled for October 14th. At the moment, Danis is preparing hard for his Misfits contest, as he\u2019s tried to get in the head of his opponent leading up to the bout. As a result, Danis has garnered over a million followers on X. \u2018El Jefe\u2019 has been trying to dig up the past relationships of Logan Paul\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Nina Agdal, as a way to create turmoil in Paul\u2019s mindset during the fight.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nHowever, this beef was first started by Logan Paul\u2019s younger brother, Jake Paul. He called out Danis on his Instagram story in 2020, by taking a hit at his rumored ex-girlfriend, Savannah Montano. So Danis\u2019s target at Agdal could have a revenge angle that many didn\u2019t know about. Even Logan addressed the topic of Montano and Jake during their first press conference. So, who is this girl? What\u2019s the actual story here?\nWho is Dillon Danis\u2019 ex-girlfriend often linked with Jake Paul?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nSavannah Montano was quite a trending name back in 2020, and that was mostly because of her relationship with the Bellator MMA fighter, Dillon Danis. Montano is a successful Instagram model, with around 1.6 million followers on her social media. The couple turned a lot of heads during their relationship, sharing some NSFW steamy pictures and videos for their fans.\nDespite their controversial relationship, Montano also gained some attention after Jake Paul used her to call out Dillon Danis for a fight. After knocking out the ex-NBA star, Nate Robinson, \u2018The Problem Child\u2019, was on the hunt to find his next opponent. At the time, the name that popped up the most was 2-0 Dillon Danis. So, when he shared the screenshot of the FaceTime with Danis\u2019s ex-girlfriend, the fans started drawing connections.\nPaul somehow found the model\u2019s number and sent her a FaceTime request. Many started to believe that Montano was having an affair and cheating on her then-boyfriend Danis. Paul posted two stories. In the first one, he wrote, \u201cAye [Dillon Danis], come get your girl back.\u201d And then in the second one, he took another hit at the fighter by writing, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you soon.\u201d So this begs the question, is it true? Was Paul actually involved in an affair with Savannah Montano?\nDid Jake Paul and Savannah Montano hook up?\nThis callout didn\u2019t help much, as Jake Paul never could finalize his fight with Dillon Danis. Instead, he ended up taking the fight against the former Olympic MMA artist, Ben Askren in 2021. He again won the fight by a knockout, while many fans still thought that Danis was smart to not respond to the Youtuber-turned-boxer. Still, Paul tried his best to involve Montano in their non-existent tussle.\nvia Getty TAMPA, FLORIDA \u2013 DECEMBER 18: Jake Paul fights Tyron Woddley during a rematch of an eight-round cruiserweight bout at the Amalie Arena on December 18, 2021 in Tampa, Florida. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann\/Getty Images)\nBesides the Instagram Stories, Jake Paul also told TMZ, about the entanglement with Savannah Montano. He said, \u201cDillon, I know you\u2019re watching this \u2026 Just remember you\u2019re still a bitch and I hooked up with your girlfriend. Savannah, how you doing? What\u2019s good?\u201d However, Montano completely denied any relation with the Influencer boxer whatsoever. She responded to Paul\u2019s stories through a video and gave her side of the story.\nShe said, \u201cI\u2019m dead confused at some of you guys going, \u2018Oh, but why did you answer his call?\u2019 As if I have his f**king number saved in my phone! It was literally a random number. You can literally see in the video, I\u2019m like, \u2018Who is this?\u2019\u201d So she denied the accusations of hooking up with Paul and even felt disgusted by the speculations.\nHowever, her current relationship status is unknown. Even three years later, many followers are still not convinced about her breakup with Dillon Danis.\nDillon Danis and Savannah Montano breakup reality\nAs of now, it\u2019s not completely clear whether the couple is still together or not. They haven\u2019t made any claims of breakup and have been silent about their relationship with each other. The only things that have changed are Savannah\u2019s Instagram feed. She has stopped posting pictures with Danis, which were quite prevalent back in 2020. Also, another thing that hints towards their breakup is Danis\u2019s first press conference for the Logan Paul fight.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nDuring the fight, Logan Paul brought up the topic of Montano, when Danis pointedly mentioned their breakup. Paul said, \u201cYo you\u2019ve been so salty ever since Savannah rejected your a** to go hook up with real athletes. You don\u2019t gotta take that s**t out on me because my brother hooked up with your ex.\u201d Danis scoffed at Maverick\u2019s claim and clapped back, \u201cAt least I got rid of the sl*t, you\u2019re marrying one.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nSo, this tells the fans that Danis is no longer together with Montano. Anyway, the fans could look out for her attendance at Danis\u2019s first-ever boxing debut on October 14 at the AO Arena, Manchester. Although there were rumors about Danis pulling out, it seems the fight is still going to take place. So, her presence at Danis\u2019s ringside may make things even more complicated. What are your thoughts about this? Are they still together?

Not very well.\nEverything that could go wrong for Dallas on Sunday did go wrong, in a game that confirmed a 49ers team that ended the Cowboys' season in each of the last two years remains a level above its NFC counterpart.\nThe 49ers carved up Dallas' defense on the opening drive, and that was a sign of what was to come. Brock Purdy threw four touchdowns in the 42-10 rout, including three to George Kittle. Christian McCaffrey scored a touchdown for a 14th consecutive game as all of San Francisco's offensive weapons got involved.\nMORE: Comparing stats for NFC stars Nick Bosa, Micah Parsons\nDefensively, the 49ers were relentless. Nobody had a larger impact than Fred Warner, who finished the night with an interception, sack and forced fumble in a swarming performance.\nThe Cowboys' offense looked very much like it did in last season's playoff exit -- uncomfortable and out of sorts. Dallas was sluggish through the first half of the game, and the night unraveled quickly when Dak Prescott threw three interceptions in the second half. It got out of hand so quickly that Sam Darnold entered the game for the 49ers with more than 12 minutes remaining.\nFor Prescott and the Cowboys, questions about whether they can get over the hump against the class of the NFC will persist. While their wins have been dominant, Dallas already sits two games behind the Eagles in the NFC East.\nThe 49ers are rolling right along, with all of their major offensive weapons now healthy and the defense living up to its billing as well. San Francisco, now 5-0, doesn't face a team with a winning record until Week 10, though the Browns, Vikings and Bengals are far from automatic wins for Kyle Shanahan's team.\nMORE: Why Brock Purdy remains one of the NFL's cheapest starting quarterbacks\nThe Sporting News tracked live scoring updates and highlights from \"Sunday Night Football\" between the Cowboys and 49ers.

The 49ers trounce the Cowboys and reassert themselves as one of the NFL's most dominant teams. Through five games, San Francisco is unbeaten.\n11:24 p.m. \u2014 These teams are trading possessions as the clock winds down. There was a brief skirmish officials had to break up as frustrations mount for Dallas.\n11:14 p.m. \u2014 A sack by Kevin Givens ends Rush's first drive of the night and sets up a Bryan Anger punt. Backups are in nearly all around for the 49ers.\n11:09 p.m. \u2014 Cooper Rush is in the game for the Cowboys...\n11:07 p.m. \u2014 Mitch Wishnowsky with an excellent punt for the 49ers, who are just trying to get through the rest of the game injury-free.\n11:04 p.m. \u2014 Sam Darnold has entered the game with 49ers. So, that's where we are with 12 minutes still on the clock.\n11:00 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 So much for that. Oren Burks gets the 49ers' third interception of the night as Prescott continues to struggle against this San Francisco defense.\n10:59 p.m. \u2014 The Cowboys are moving the ball now, when it's a bit too late. Tony Pollard rips off a 26-yard run to finally break through.\n49ers 42, Cowboys 10\n10:53 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 And just like that, Jordan Mason runs in for another 49ers touchdown! This is ugly on all levels for the Cowboys, and Leighton Vander Esch is now down as well. 42-10, 49ers.\n10:52 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 Fred Warner now has a sack, forced fumble and an interception tonight. A pass from Prescott is deflected into his hands, and the 49ers have another instant scoring opportunity.\n49ers 35, Cowboys 10\n10:47 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 Purdy hits Kyle Juszczyk for the 49ers' fifth touchdown of the night. That's four touchdowns for Purdy alone, and San Francisco is pouring it all on the Cowboys.\nEnd of third quarter: 49ers 28, Cowboys 10\n10:43 p.m. \u2014 San Francisco is moving the ball inch-by-inch now, and the 'Niners are a yard away from making this a 25-point game.\n10:38 p.m. \u2014 The 49ers are on the verge of entering the red zone after a 19-yard catch by Jauan Jennings. Purdy is up to 242 yards to go along with his three touchdowns.\n10:32 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 Prescott heaves it downfield under pressure and it's intercepted by Tashaun Gipson. For a Cowboys team that has embarrassed a few opponents this year, they might be on the bad end of an ugly game here.\n49ers 28, Cowboys 10\n10:27 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 Not one, not two, THREE touchdowns for George Kittle. The 49ers have everything working offensively tonight, and any Kittle fantasy owners are thrilled.\n10:25 p.m. \u2014 Aiyuk's loss is Deebo Samuel's gain. Samuel goes 43 yards on the very next play, which tells you how automatic the 49ers' offense is right now. San Francisco is in the red zone looking to make this a three-score game.\n10:23 p.m. \u2014 An offensive holding call wipes out a 40-yard gain from Aiyuk. Wow. That's a momentum swing. Spencer Burford is the culprit.\n10:21 p.m. \u2014 The Purdy-to-Aiyuk connection continues to get stronger. Aiyuk goes for 23 yards to give the 49ers some breathing room after opening their drive with a false start.\n49ers 21, Cowboys 10\n10:17 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The 49ers' defense tightens the screws and limits Dallas to a field goal.

That quickly takes the Cowboys into 49ers territory to start the second half.\nEnd of first half: 49ers 21, Cowboys 7\n9:58 p.m. \u2014 San Francisco's defense is all over the Cowboys yet again. It's Dre Greenlaw's turn to sack Prescott, and Dallas is waving the white flag on the half. They'll start the second half with the ball.\n9:56 p.m. \u2014 49ers edge rusher Drake Jackson is walking off after requiring some medical attention on the field.\n9:52 p.m. \u2014 The 49ers tried to put something together, but a third down pass to Aiyuk was too low. Dallas has a minute to try and get something before halftime.\n9:45 p.m. \u2014 The Cowboys looked better on third down on their last drive, but Prescott's third down pass to Ferguson is short of the line to gain and ends this drive quickly. The 49ers will have a couple minutes to blow this game open before halftime.\n49ers 21, Cowboys 7\n9:38 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 McCaffrey pushes through for the touchdown. That's his 14th consecutive game finding the end zone, and it puts the 'Niners back up two scores.\n9:37 p.m. \u2014 Deebo Samuel takes some big hits but gets the 49ers down to the one-yard line. San Francisco is knocking on the door again.\n9:35 p.m. \u2014 The Cowboys had done a pretty nice job of containing McCaffrey to this point, but the former Pro-Bowler takes a screen pass for 19 yards to push the Niners to the edge of the red zone.\n9:31 p.m. \u2014 Aiyuk with a quick 15-yard catch to start the 49ers' drive.

San Francisco has an instant opportunity here.\n9:01 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 Oh no! Pollard gets the ball knocked out deep in the Cowboys' own territory, and it looks like it was recovered by the 49ers. Officials are checking to make sure nobody was out of bounds, but that ball was very much out of Pollard's control. The 49ers could be set up in the red zone.\n8:59 p.m. \u2014 The drive completely falls apart for the 49ers. A delay of game penalty sets San Francisco back, and Christian McCaffrey is dropped for a five-yard loss on 3rd & 15. Not allowing even a field goal is a huge win for Dallas.\n8:56 p.m. \u2014 The 49ers are excelling on third down early in this game, and Purdy flips it to Kyle Juszczyk to keep the Niners' drive alive on 3rd & 1.\n8:54 p.m. \u2014 Now Kearse lines up offsides... That extends the drive for the 49ers, who aren't moving as freely as they were on that opening drive.\n8:50 p.m. \u2014 Jayron Kearse comes through with the Cowboys' first sack of the night, but Deebo Samuel makes up 11 of the 12 yards San Francisco needs on the next play.\n8:46 p.m. \u2014 There's the first catch of the night for Lamb, but he doesn't get the first down and Dak Prescott is sacked by Nick Bosa to quickly end the drive. This 49ers defense has picked up right where it left off against the Cowboys in January.\n8:44 p.m. \u2014 Dallas' second drive starts out with Tony Pollard getting dropped for a loss.\n8:40 p.m. \u2014 Big-time stop by the Cowboys' defense as Johnathan Hankins deflects Purdy's third down pass with his helmet and forces a punt.\n8:36 p.m. \u2014 The 49ers' defense was all over Dallas on that drive. Three plays, two incompletions, and now the Cowboys will punt it right back.\n49ers 7, Cowboys 0\n8:30 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 Purdy finds a wide open Kittle in the end zone for the score! That was a well-scripted opening drive by Kyle Shanahan, and San Francisco has an early 7-0 lead.\n8:27 p.m. \u2014 A little bit of chaos as Deebo Samuel drops a ball that was pretty close to being a fumble, but it's all a non-issue as Dallas is hit with an offsides penalty. The 49ers are right about in field goal range.\n8:25 p.m. \u2014 After a facemask penalty and a nine-yard pass to Brandon Aiyuk, the 49ers are already over midfield.\n8:23 p.m. \u2014 Kickoff is a bit on the later end, but we are about to get underway. The 49ers will start with the ball.\n8:10 p.m. \u2014 Jerry Jones said this week that this game will be a test of how the Cowboys match up with the NFL's best, as if there wasn't already pressure on Dallas to show something after the 49ers knocked them out of the playoffs in back-to-back years.\n7:56 p.m. \u2014 Frank Gore and Vernon Davis are in the house!

Is he due for a huge performance tonight?\n7:11 p.m. \u2014 New 49ers acquisition Randy Gregory is officially inactive against his former team.\n7:01 p.m. \u2014 The Eagles are going to win in Los Angeles, so the 49ers need a win to keep pace atop the NFC. After they had to play the last two NFC championship games on the road, the No. 1 seed is undoubtedly in the back of their minds.\n6:45 p.m. \u2014 The run of great prime-time weather continues, as it's set to be in the high 70s and sunny in Santa Clara tonight.

{"title":"FanDuel Picks Week 14: Best NFL DFS lineup advice for daily fantasy football tournaments","context":"## FanDuel Picks Week 14: Best NFL DFS lineup advice for daily fantasy football tournaments\n\nThe season of giving is here as we wind down the 2023 NFL season. We've already given you winners and losers, highs and lows, sleepers and busts, and a few moments to forget, but we hope to keep giving you more of the positives to look back on as the season enters its final weeks. If you need to scratch that fantasy itch with your season-long league coming to an end, look no further than our FanDuel DFS lineup for Week 14, which will ideally provide us with enough cash to boost the economy this holiday season.\nBefore we break down our picks and strategy, here are the most notable scoring rules for FanDuel contests: four-point passing TDs and half-point PPR.\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nFanDuel Picks Week 14: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments\nSunday main slate, $60,000 budget\nQB Gardner Minshew, Colts @ Bengals ($6,900). Minshew Mania is eyeing a postseason spot and has the Colts with a 7-5 record heading into the final few weeks of the season. Now he gets a Bengals team that's limping to the finish thanks to Joe Burrow's thumb injury that cost him the season. The Colts are a motivated bunch in a tight AFC South, while evidence continues to mount that they knocked the Shane Steichen hire out of the park. Minshew is a capable fantasy starter, as shown by his 312 yards and two TDs last week, and he's certainly worth another DFS flier in a week that offers very few worthwhile value options.\nRB Joe Mixon, Bengals vs. Colts ($7,200). Mixon has been forced to step up without Burrow under center, doubling as a runner and receiver for Cincinnati. Jake Browning has relied heavily upon the veteran RB, evidenced by Mixon's two touchdowns on Monday night against the Jaguars. Burrow's injury has made Mixon arguably the Bengals' top fantasy option now. We'll gladly insert the RB into the lineup in a good matchup against a Indianapolis team that's had some issues defending RBs, notably getting torched by Derrick Henry and Tyjae Spears one week ago.\nWEEK 14 DFS:\nDK lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nRB Breece Hall, Jets vs. Texans ($6,400). It's Week 14 and there is a Jets player in this DFS lineup. How bad can it get? The good news is that it can always get worse, and Hall's role in this offense makes him a worthy dart throw in this lineup. He continues to see plenty of carries and a big role in the passing game. While the offense can't score, the volume is there against a Texans team that has struggled to defend RBs out of the backfield. If the Jets manage to find the end zone for the first time since sliced bread was invented, Hall has a good chance to do it. Considering it's borderline insane to include a Jets player in any DFS lineup, that means we might be one of the few who actually roster him, which could help our cause.\nWR Mike Evans, Buccaneers @ Falcons ($8,500). Evans hauled in six-of-eight targets for 82 yards and a score last time he saw the Falcons, and he's only gotten better, putting together another great season for Tampa as Baker Mayfield's top option in the passing game. The incredible target share gives us no reason to think that won't continue.\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWR Michael Pittman Jr., Colts @ Bengals ($8,000). Imagine saying back in the summer that the Minshew-Pittman stack would be one of the best in fantasy this season. It's a wild reality, but also one that continues to fly under the radar more often than not. Pittman is coming off back-to-back games of at least 100 yards, and he just put up a season-high 16 against the Titans. That volume doesn't grow on trees, and there are no signs of the WR slowing down anytime soon as the Colts push for a playoff spot.\nWR Deebo Samuel, 49ers vs. Seahawks ($7,500). Samuel rewarded us with a big performance against the Eagles, backing up all the talking he did since losing in the NFC Championship Game last season. There's no reason to believe that can't continue against the same Seahawks team that he carved up on Thanksgiving. Samuel has historically feasted against Seattle, and with the Niners eyeing that top spot in the NFC, we should expect that to be the case again.\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nTE Gerald Everett, Chargers @ Broncos ($5,100). The Chargers offense is tough to watch right now. Between injuries and drops, we can't determine what is more maddening on a week-to-week basis, but Everett has a great matchup in Week 14, one that we've continued to target quite often this year. Everett hasn't posted 50 yards or more in a game this season, but this should be his best chance to do that plus have a good shot at a TD. We'll take the discount for someone who should outperform his DFS salary.\nFLEX RB Dameon Pierce, Texans @ Jets ($6,100). MetLife Stadium promises to be the site of yet another bad weather game and all that rain means we'll be seeing plenty of the RBs on Sunday. Pierce appears to have regained the RB1 spot from Devin Singletary, evidenced by his 15 carries last week to just eight for his teammate. Efficiency has been a problem for the sophomore back, but the Jets present another decent matchup for a RB to find their footing. With an ugly game on tap, Pierce should have more than enough opportunities to deliver from a fantasy standpoint.\nDEF New Orleans Saints vs. Panthers ($4,300). The Panthers are and have been a complete disaster this year, only shielded by the fact that they play in Charlotte rather than the Boston and New York areas. They have a QB who can't compete with the extreme lack of talent up and down the roster, a lame-duck coaching staff, and countless other factors. They're 1-11 and are playing a divisional rival that, despite being 5-7, is somehow not out of the playoff race. New Orleans' offense is a mess, but the defense should be primed to bounce back after a rough Week 13.\nBest SuperDraft NFL DFS Picks for Week 14\nThis year, we're also listing our favorite DFS plays on SuperDraft.\nFor those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.\nMORE: Win BIG with SuperDraft!

Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan) - 37 goals\nAll of Martinez's goals this year have come at club level for Inter Milan, with none coming on the international scene for Argentina.\nWith so many goals this campaign, it's no surprise that the Serie A giants are desperate to tie him down to a new deal.\nHe currently leads the Scudetto Golden Boot race - six more than closest rival Domenico Berardi.\n8 Inter striker Martinez has carried on from last season by banging them in for fun Credit: Getty\n6. Santiago Gimenez (Feyenoord\/Mexico) - 39 goals\nOne of the most exciting strikers in world football, the 22-year-old has taken European football by storm.\nJoining Dutch side Feyenoord in the summer of 2022, he fired Arne Slot's men to the Eredivisie championship with 15 goals.\nWith 20 goals this season along with two strikes for Mexico, it's clear to see why Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea have all been linked with a move.\n8 Gimenez seems destined for a big move in the near future Credit: Getty\n5. Romelu Lukaku (Roma\/Belgium) - 40 goals\nAfter reuniting with Jose Mourinho at Roma in the summer, Lukaku has found his goalscoring form once again.\nThe Belgian has been firing back in Serie A following another loan move from Chelsea, netting in almost all of his starts this season.\nHe has also found his shooting boots for his country, most notably scoring four in a 5-0 win over Azerbaijan in November.\nLukaku's career seems to have reignited and that has seen him close to claiming a place as one of the highest goalscorers this year.\n8 Lukaku ended the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign as top scorer Credit: AFP\n4. Erling Haaland (Manchester City\/Norway) - 50 goals\nNo player in Premier League history has made more of an impact following their arrival than Haaland, who broke the goal record for a single season with 36 strikes last term.\nHe has already been firing in many top-flight goals this term - as well as being the joint-leading scorer from the Champions League group stages.\nJust six out of his 50 goals in 2023 have been for his national side Norway, with Haaland helping the Citizens to a historic treble last campaign.\nWith two games left for City in 2023, Haaland has time to be the overall top scorer, though it remains to be seen if Pep Guardiola will play him against Everton and Sheffield United.\nHaaland has missed City's last five games with a foot injury, but it is believed he could be in contention now to return to action.\n8 Haaland is the leading goalscorer in the Premier League this season\n2*. Kylian Mbappe (Paris Saint-Germain\/France) - 52 goals\nParis Saint Germain's all-time record scorer with 233 goals, it's easy to forget that the ex-Monaco man is still just 24 years old.\nHe has added even more goals to his tally for Les Parisiens this term, while he has fired in ten times for the French national team.\nMbappe's overall tally of 46 goals for Les Bleus is just ten shy of Giroud's current record.\nIn the final year of his contract at Parc des Princes, Real Madrid are favourites to secure a free transfer next summer, but they face competition from Liverpool.\nPSG have no games left to play in 2023 due to the French winter break, with Mbappe therefore unable to catch Ronaldo.\n8 Mbappe has enjoyed a stunning 2023 having scored 52 goals for club and country Credit: AFP\n2*. Harry Kane (Bayern Munich\/Tottenham\/England) - 52 goals\nA stunning 2022\/23 season saw Bayern splash out over \u00a3100m to sign the Spurs legend in August.\nAnd Kane has repaid the Bundesliga club's faith having broken a number of records with his 25 goals so far this season.\nThe leading scorer [22 goals] in the German top-flight, the Three Lions skipper set a new Bundesliga record last month by finding the back of the net 17 times in his opening 11 outings.\nKane, who has scored nine goals for England in 2023, is also the first player to register a hat-trick in their first outing against Borussia Dortmund.\nIt should come as no surprise that he is also on course to score the most goals in a debut Bundesliga campaign as he hunts down Uwe Seeler's record of 30 for Hamburg in the 1963\/64 season.\nAs well as that, Kane is on track to break Robert Lewandowski's record of 41 goals in a single season.\nHe's adding assists, too, as evidenced by his 'filthy' effort against Man United in the Champions League.\nLike Mbappe, Kane cannot overtake Ronaldo's tally due to the German winter break.\n8 Kane already has 25 goals for Bayern in all competitions Credit: Getty\n1. Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr\/Portugal) - 53 goals\nRonaldo has chipped in with 43 goals for Al Nassr to prove he never left his shooting boots back in Europe.\nHe has even banged in ten times for Portugal, as he helped the Euro 2016 winners triumph in all ten of their Euro 2024 qualifying matches.\nHis half-century in 2023 is the eighth time in his career that he has scored at least 50 goals in a calendar year.\nHis two strikes in the 5-2 win against Karim Benzema's Al Ittihad saw him leapfrog above Kane and Mbappe.\nAnd with Al Nassr still having one match left before 2024, he could add to his ever-growing tally.\n\nThis article, authored by Jake Lambourne, was published by TalkSport on 2023-12-12 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":277}
{"title":"Alexis Ohanian says he\u2019s a \u2018techno optimist,\u2019 despite social media\u2019s impact on society","context":"## Alexis Ohanian says he\u2019s a \u2018techno optimist,\u2019 despite social media\u2019s impact on society\n\nDoes Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian have regrets over his creation? The entrepreneur and founder of venture fund Seven Seven Six, speaking at an event at the University of Virginia, espoused a fairly negative view of the current social media landscape and the creator economy \u2014 an environment where he says, everyone has \u201cbeen so trained and conditioned now to just get the likes and retweets, get the upvotes\u2026I wish I could be more optimistic about it, but we\u2019re seeing it play out before our eyes.\u201d Still, he ultimately described himself as a \u201ctechno-optimist\u201d \u2014 an apparent nod to a16z General Partner Marc Andreessen\u2019s recent diatribe where he claimed technology could solve all our problems.\n\u201cGuilty as charged,\u201d Ohanian said, during his interview with Kara Swisher. \u201cI do think that pendulum will swing back. I think even swifter than we realize.\u201d The war in the Middle East may even be the tipping point, he theorized, as it\u2019s now \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that we need something better to figure out the world than the platforms we have today.\nThe founder, as you may recall, notably resigned from Reddit\u2019s board in 2020 over differences of opinion on moderation and wanting to crack down on communities about violence and hate. It was a moment where he seemed to be reckoning with what his platform had wrought. At the time, he asked for his board seat to be replaced by a Black board member. The company agreed, appointing its first Black board member with Y Combinator partner Michael Seibel.\nReddit also later banned several toxic communities, including r\/donaldtrup following violence at the U.S. Capitol, and Ohanian says that the site has \u201cgotten demonstrably better,\u201d since, as well as better as a business.\nBut as for social media as a whole, of which Reddit would presumably play a part, Ohanian said it brings out the \u201cworst parts of our nature in many ways.\u201d What\u2019s more, he expressed worries about the desire for people to be first and win on whatever leaderboard a platform features, which then leads to a situation where misinformation is able to spread.\nHumans evolved trusting the faces & voices we knew around the campfire. The idea of believing something bc of experts\/institutions you've never met is actually new to our species. I visited @UVADemocracy + chatted with @karaswisher + @dkroy about what's next for social media. pic.twitter.com\/PMBXi7T3vv \u2014 Alexis Ohanian \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf2 (@alexisohanian) October 31, 2023\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s so much pressure to be first, and UGC \u2014 user-generated content \u2014 will always win. It won\u2019t always be right, though. But it becomes the epicenter of where the conversation is. And then I\u2019ll think what percentage of our population really wants to earnestly take the breath and say, let me stop doomscrolling, and let me just wait until people can do the work, synthesize it and then help me react?\u201d he continued.\n\u201cWe are also so plugged into all these storylines, whether it\u2019s from traditional media, whether it\u2019s from user-generated \u2014 someone on their phone, you know, posting to a Telegram group. We are overwhelmed and overloaded, and it\u2019s unfortunately appealing to the worst parts of a lot of our instincts,\u201d Ohanian added.\nIn part, some of the issues around how social media platforms developed had to do with how the companies were originally developed. Ohanian, for example, shared that Reddit grew out of his running of a forum site in college, when he believed that online community felt as real as offline. He said he never conceived of the influence the site would one day hold \u2014 when Reddit became a multibillion-dollar business with hundreds of millions of users. That thought would have been \u201cludicrous,\u201d he said. And he certainly never could have imagined his startup could have become so successful that it could affect elections and democracies.\n\u201cTo\u2026 think Oh my god, I\u2019m gonna be so successful, it could have a tremendous impact on democracy would take a level of delusion that even I, as a first-time CEO, just couldn\u2019t have,\u201d he noted. \u201cWas that a blind spot? Absolutely,\u201d he admitted.\nOhanian identified that another part of the problem is that there are more people online today than early tech founders may have imagined. Though he\u2019s glad that access to the technology has broadened, that has come with many complications.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that the internet I\u2019m so nostalgic for was actually an ivory tower,\u201d he said, but on the flip side, he said, we\u2019re all exposed to more people, in real-time, than we could have ever fathomed. And that can put people at odds with one another and with everyone\u2019s different versions of the truth \u2014 even if their truth is believing in something as far-fetched as the earth being flat, he said, pointing to one example that has a following on Reddit.\nMeanwhile, asking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit to be in charge of verifying truth and accuracy is a difficult task, he said. Ohanian also called out TikTok as \u201can arm for the Chinese government\u201d that\u2019s really good at \u201cfeeding us what we want, when we want it\u201d \u2014 in other words, not always a fountain of truth, either.\nIf anything, Ohanian credits Twitter (now called X) with coming up with the best system for moderation so far.\n\u201cCommunity Notes, I personally think is a good \u2014 it\u2019s the best measure I\u2019ve seen yet. And frankly, I wish we had thought of it first,\u201d he said.\nStill, he called out the notion that a platform, like X, can be a town square.\n\u201cThe public square [analogy]\u2026falls flat. Because if that then implies that it\u2019s a public square, which means like, what? a town or a city? If you\u2019re the person in charge of it, you\u2019re the mayor. But there\u2019s no democratic election,\u201d Ohanian pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re a CEO. So then you\u2019re like the king? If you want to lean into the town square thing, fine. Just own it and say, yeah, it\u2019s a town square and I am the infinite dictator, tyrant of it.\u201d\nDespite the problems with social media and the urgency, in terms of its impact on society, Ohanian believes there\u2019s still some hope. He noted, for example, that the founders his fund 776 invests in are much smarter and more aware of the issues than he ever was at their age. Perhaps the next platforms will still be addictive, but in a way that doesn\u2019t \u201cfurther disrupt democracy,\u201d he mused.\nHe also believes that after everything on social media becomes so perfectly curated for us, our brains will start to crave things that are not. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a rebirth of live gatherings and in-person experiences\u2026the bright side of this is that I hope it then gets us back in touch with our humanity, and the things that no amount of AI can replace.\u201d\n\u201cI want to be an optimist about it,\u201d Ohanian added. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s still a path forward but we\u2019re fighting against very, very strong human things. And if we can solve it, it will do so much good. It really, really will because we will find out we have more in common than not,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-31 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":278}
{"title":"Thanksgiving is Spider-Man\u2019s holiday","context":"## Thanksgiving is Spider-Man\u2019s holiday\n\nMarvel built its comic book revolution on the back of one idea: rendering colorful superheroes as relatable. In the mid 20th century, DC do-gooders were essentially square-jawed Sunday school teachers, which let Marvel corner the market on heroes with human depth and fragility. The Fantastic Four were vulnerable to insecurity and in-fighting. The X-Men represented the cost of bigotry on a wide scale.\nBut Spider-Man represented this new wave best. Consumed by youthful everyman angst and desperate to find balance in his life, Spider-Man is broadly sympathetic. We identify with his struggles and his little glimmers of connection and triumph \u2014 which makes him the perfect superhero for Thanksgiving. And Spider-Man writers know it.\nThanksgiving has a complicated history, tied to the roots of American colonialism, and more recently processed through a lens of joyful capitalism. But feeding friends and family is perhaps one of the most humane acts we can pursue. It\u2019s less about the spirit of giving, and more about admitting that people have innate, basic needs, like food and social comfort, and that those needs are best fulfilled when people work in tandem. Honestly, we should try to do it more on every other day of the year: The number of people volunteering to help feed the homeless and families in need peaks around November and December, but that energy needs to be carried through the preceding 10 months, too.\nSpider-Man represents these needs, even though very few of us have to balance photojournalist work, a fraught dating life, and pummeling Dr. Octopus. Peter Parker is often the most financially strapped among his Avengers buddies, and frequently the loneliest, too. Those are recognizable traits among many young people, even those without radioactive-spider powers. When you\u2019re growing up and trying to figure out the world, it\u2019s easy to feel lost and isolated. But feelings of loneliness spike during the holidays, meaning that there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll feel even more like Peter Parker when late November rolls around.\nIt\u2019s what makes the Thanksgiving scene in the 2002 Spider-Man film so engaging. That whole movie is an exercise in heart-on-your-sleeve sweetness. Everyone who\u2019s seen it knows the Thanksgiving dinner rapidly descends into chaos, with Norman Osborn ominously sticking his fingers into Aunt May\u2019s sweet-potato casserole, figuring out Spider-Man\u2019s secret identity, and delivering a grossly sexist diatribe to his son Harry, leaving Harry and Mary Jane at odds with each other. Aunt May and Peter clearly wind up with a ton of leftovers after everyone else storms out.\nBut for Peter, who\u2019s just lost his Uncle Ben and has been facing the initial trials of being Spider-Man, there\u2019s a nice moment of personal respite at the opening of that scene, where he walks into a room where he knows he\u2019s loved, bearing an offering of cranberry sauce,. Sure, everyone in that room is trying to hold things together. Mary Jane wants to impress Norman, Harry wants to impress Norman and Mary Jane, Peter loves Mary Jane but doesn\u2019t dare hurt Harry, and Aunt May is finishing what\u2019s presumably a dope turkey, in an attempt to care for all of them.\nIt\u2019s the trying that counts: Life can be hard, weird, and cruel, but while sitting down for a meal with our nearest and dearest, maybe for at least a little while, we won\u2019t need to have it all figured out.\nNot all Spider-Man Thanksgiving dinners end up falling apart, and some succeed in reminding Peter that he isn\u2019t alone. The first season of The Spectacular Spider-Man ends with a bang: One of Peter\u2019s closest pals, Eddie Brock, has become Venom, and has threatened everyone Peter holds dear. This comes just after Peter himself was infected by the symbiote, and went through the now-iconic throes of pushing everyone away. Aunt May has just gotten out of the hospital, and even noted jerk \u201cFlash\u201d Thompson has given Peter hell for how awful he\u2019s been acting.\nPeter, attempting to make things right, opts to cook the Thanksgiving meal all by himself, but mostly succeeds in ruining the kitchen. No worries \u2014 Gwen Stacy and her father, along with a recuperating Aunt May and her doctor, all help out, and the episode concludes with a pleasant dinner. There are no big turns or twists, aside from Aunt May revealing that she\u2019s publishing a cookbook. It\u2019s just simple, earned solace in a life marked by chaos. Peter even gets a kiss from Gwen on his porch, a sequence conducted with a John Hughes sense of satisfying romantic flair.\nVarious Spider-Man comics have also dabbled in seeing what Thanksgiving looks like when you\u2019re young and arachnid-themed, but real life has associated Spider-Man with the holiday, too. Spider-Man is the only Marvel character to rate a balloon in the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade. Other Marvel characters have appeared on floats, but only Spider-Man has been inflated to 80 feet and pulled through the Upper West Side. (That also makes him the only Marvel character to have his head horrifically torn open by a tree branch.)\nFrom his first comic book appearance, Spider-Man has been a reminder that life is hard and complicated, and being a superhero doesn\u2019t preclude anyone from experiencing ordinary frustrations, setbacks, and confusion. But no matter how Spider-Man\u2019s Thanksgiving escapades turn out, they remind readers and viewers that the holiday is about the hope of mutual connection, support, and nurturing. Even if the girl of your dreams is out of reach and the Green Goblin is on your case, a table, some friends, and Aunt May\u2019s rad turkey might just make everything better for a little while.\n\nThis article, authored by Daniel Dockery, was published by Polygon on 2023-11-23 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":279}

{"title":"Are NBA Christmas Day Games a Better Tradition Than NFL Thanksgiving Day Games?","context":"## Are NBA Christmas Day Games a Better Tradition Than NFL Thanksgiving Day Games?\n\nThe United States of America is home to several entertaining sports and leagues. However, football and basketball have resonated more deeply with the majority of the population than other offerings. Since their inception, the two sports have captured the imaginations of the fans and captivated them with their entertaining offerings\u2014namely, the NFL and the NBA. The NBA and the NFL share a fierce rivalry because they stand out as the two preeminent professional sports leagues in the United States. While the NFL enjoys greater popularity within the United States, the NBA far outperforms its counterpart in global popularity and impact.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nBoth leagues have crafted their own festive traditions with the NFL\u2019s Thanksgiving Day games and the NBA\u2019s Christmas Day matchups. These special events have become cherished customs, captivating fans in their unique ways. Thanksgiving Day games are as intertwined with Thanksgiving as turkeys, while Christmas Day games have become as synonymous with Christmas as eggnog and presents. However, when comparing the two festive traditions, which one holds more significance, or which tradition has garnered greater popularity?\nHow do NBA\u2019s Christmas Day games compare to NFL\u2019s Thanksgiving Day games?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nBoth traditions hold a special place in the hearts of fans, creating an annual spectacle that goes beyond the typical sporting event. The NBA\u2019s Christmas Day games is a tradition which is even older than the NFL\u2019s Super Bowl. The first Christmas Day game dates back to 1947, when the league featured three games as a festive treat for basketball fans. Since then, the NBA Christmas Day has only grown in stature and significance. Last season, Christmas Day games averaged 4.27 viewers across all platforms. The significance of this tradition can be evaluated by the fact that these games attract about 200% more viewers than any other regular season game.\nUSA Today via Reuters Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\nHowever, despite these impressive viewership numbers, the NFL\u2019s Thanksgiving Day games eclipse them by a considerable margin. This season, NFL\u2019s Thanksgiving Day games created history. Across all the three games, the NFL recorded an average viewership of 34.1 million. These figures surpassed last year\u2019s record viewership of 33.6 million. Furthermore, the combined unduplicated audience for all three games reached 133 million, marking the second-highest total audience on Thanksgiving, surpassed only by last year\u2019s numbers.\nThese figures paint a pretty one-sided picture, but the choice is much more nuanced. Comparing the NBA Christmas Day Games and NFL Thanksgiving Day Games comes down to personal preference. Each tradition holds its own significance, adding to the diverse fabric of American sports culture. Whether one prefers the slam dunks and three-pointers of the NBA or the hard-hitting action on the football field, both traditions offer a festive and entertaining way to celebrate holidays with family and friends.\nAre the NFL\u2019s new decisions threatening the NBA\u2019s Christmas Day dominance?\nThe enduring success and importance of Christmas Day games suggest that this 77-year-old tradition will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the NFL\u2019s recent decisions could threaten the NBA\u2019s stronghold on Christmas. Traditionally, the NFL has avoided Christmas Day games that fall outside of their broadcasting window. However, last year the NFL averaged 22.1 million viewers on Christmas Day games, and 2023 could be even bigger.\nvia Reuters REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach |\nThe NFL has lined up a mouth-watering slate for Christmas. Superstars like Patrick Mahomes, Brock Purdy and Jalen Hurts are all set to take the field on Christmas. According to some estimations, the NFL\u2019s total viewership during the festive period could outperform that of the NBA by almost 75 million viewers. This creates a huge dilemma for the NBA, as traditionally they have maintained a firm grip on Christmas.\nHowever, it still remains to be seen whether the NFL pursues Christmas Day games in the future. The NFL\u2019s top executives have stated that they won\u2019t schedule games on Christmas if the holiday falls outside their regular broadcasting window. But, enough of the negative stuff, let\u2019s shift our attention to the positive aspects.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nWhat does the NBA have in store for Christmas?\nAs Christmas arrives, so do the NBA\u2019s Christmas Day games, a tradition that predates even the Super Bowl. This year\u2019s Christmas Day slate is loaded, with games taking place in New York, Los Angeles and Miami. NBA superstars like LeBron, Steph, Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Durant, and many others are scheduled to take the court later tonight.

{"title":"Lions vs. Packers live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Thursday Night Football' game","context":"## Lions vs. Packers live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Thursday Night Football' game\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown was in the midst of a tempest, shrouded in a sea of green with few options around him. The Lions WR had done the hard part, stretching beyond an exasperated Packers defense to trot into the end zone.\nBut he had a choice to make: rollick in the joy of his sapphire-clad teammates. Or take a leap of faith into the Lambeau Field abyss.\nHe opted for the latter. St. Brown hurled himself into the green lagoon. Then, he smiled.\nSt. Brown's impersonation of the Lambeau Leap was one of many high points in a memorable night for Detroit. Fueled by a stout defensive showing, a gritty run game and a bit of fairy dust from the likes of St. Brown, Sam LaPorta and Josh Reynolds, the Lions cruised to a 34-20 win over their hated NFC North rivals, Green Bay.\nThursday's game appeared to be destined to be a showcase of quarterbacking excellence; Jared Goff and Jordan Love have proved themselves to be formidable options under center since taking the reins of their respective offenses.\nBut it was the supporting cast that proved so pivotal to Thursday's result for Dan Campbell's side. David Montgomery was a nuisance, slipping through crevices to puncture the heart of the Packers' defense. When it wasn't him, it was that receiving corp, made up of unheralded youngsters who have all come up trumps in recent weeks.\nAs for Love and Co., Thursday's affair was another indication of just how much work there is to be done before they compete for the divisional crown. There were certainly some flits of delight, throws that highlighted just how much talent Love possesses in his golden arm.\nBut there were low points, too, misshapen efforts that fell harmlessly to the turf, or harmfully into the opposition's hands.\nNFL WEEK 4 PICKS: Straight up | Against the spread | Projection model\nThe Sporting News tracked live updates from Thursday's clash between the Lions and the Packers.

Packers have one timeout remaining but Montgomery's fiery run through the tackles should make that obsolete.\n11:11 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Carlson's try from distance makes the deficit two possessions.\n11:08 p.m.: Not so fast. ... A quick three-and-out gives Green Bay a glimmer. That glimmer grows even brighter after an impressive return by Keisean Nixon. Let's see what they can do with 3:30 left.\n11:04 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! That's wraps. Love misses his target, instead finding the mitts of Jacobs for his second pick of the day. Strong showing by this Detroit defense. And that should put things to bed.\n10:54 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Walker's penalty proves vital as Montgomery finds pay dirt from a couple yards out on fourth down. Gutsy call by Campbell. And one that pays off in spades for Detroit, which extends its lead to 17.\nLions 34, Packers 17\n10:50 p.m.: Quay Walker's leaps over a blocker on Riley Patterson's field goal attempt, prompting a unsportsmanlike penalty. That will put Detroit on the cusp of another score, pending a Packers defensive rally.\n10:43 p.m.: Lions beginning to salt the game away with strong running through the tackles. Montgomery and Gibbs creeping through the crevices to push Detroit down the field. And an impressive toss from Goff into the outstretched hands of Reynolds, as well. The Lions are on the doorstep of the red zone.\n10:36 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Love scampers into the end zone from short distance to cut that Detroit lead down even more. He got held short of the end zone on the ensuing two-point effort. But Green Bay is firmly back in it.\nLions 27, Packers 17\nEnd of third quarter: Lions 27, Packers 11\n10:31 p.m.: Impressive pitch-and-catch by Love and Jayden Reed. Packers hurler drops it right into Reed's bread basket for the 44 yard gain as the quarter comes to an end.\n10:24 p.m.: Things slow down for Green Bay on Drive No. 2 of the second half. Punt incoming. Packers need less of that as they attempt their second-straight rally in as many weeks.\n10:15 p.m.: Green Bay defense firms up, forcing yet another punt. Can Love and the Packers bring things back?\n10:10 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Love finds Watson for the TD, giving Packers fans a much-needed boost of adrenaline. Good drive by Green Bay, which finally shows signs of life after a putrid first half.\nLions 27, Packers 11\n10:05 p.m.: Great throw by Love, who threads the needle to find Romeo Doubs to keep the chains moving on fourth down. Packers on the brink of a much-needed touchdown.\n9:58 p.m.: This Green Bay offense has to come to life sooner rather than later. If not, this scoreboard could get even more crooked.\nGood start to the third frame by the Pack, who find themselves marauding down the field with relative ease in the quarter's opening possession. Every journey began with a single step...\n9:20 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Love's errant pass gets snagged by Jerry Jacobs, who plods 20 yards back to put Detroit on the brink of the promised land. It's been a putrid start for Love and the Green Bay offense so far.\n9:15 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! The good times keep on rolling for Detroit, which adds to its lead after another standout drive spearheaded by Goff and Montgomery. The Lions are rolling early.\nLions 17, Packers 3\nEnd of first quarter: Lions 14, Pacers 3\n8:51 p.m.: Impressive play-calling for the Lions, who continue to carve their way up the field.\n8:50 p.m.: Love has been unable to find a rhythm in his first few possessions. Another gives Detroit another chance to make the Lions' life a living hell.\n8:43 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Montgomery goes into his right tackle before finding the end zone. Detroit's office os cooking with gan.\nLions 14, Packers 3\n8:42 p.m.: Decent scamper by Goff brings Detroit right to the cusp of pay first. Lions are closed to adding a second score.\n8:40 p.m.: Since the interception, it's felt as if Goff and the Lions can get anything they want. Gibbs is lightning in a bottle, while Montgomery brings the thunder. This drive just continues to get lengthier and lengthier.\n8:34 p.m.: Lions are looking menacing as can be in the trenches. Isaiah Buggs sends Love spiraling with a crunching hit behind the line. The Packers are giving the ball back to the Lions on a three-and-out.\n8:29 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Amon-Ra St. Brown leaps, stretches and reels in Goff's feather towards the corner of the end zone! Detroit showing just what its offense can do when its clicking.\nLions 7, Packers 3\n8:27 p.m.: Sam LaPorta gets beyond his marker with a strong move and plods 35 yards down the field. The rookie tight end has been producing at a historic clip so far. And it looks like he's on pace for another standout showing this week.\n8:26 p.m.: Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery look a formidable duo in the backfield. Just collaborated to push the Lions forward as they move the chains for the first time today.\n8:21 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Packers open the scoring courtesy of an Anders Carlson field goal. Lions defense held tough, all things considered. Aidan Hutchinson burst through the trenches to send Love tumbling to precipitate the stop.\nPackers 3, Lions 0\n8:14 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Rudy Ford swipes Jared Goff's errant pass from the sky and takes it back 16 yards to put the Packers on the cusp of the end zone! That's Goff's third interception in as many games!\n8:13 p.m.: Lions starting the game with the ball. Packers defense looking stout as ever through the opening two plays.\n8:12 p.m.: Weezy F Baby leading the Packers out onto the field! Wasn't expecting that!\n7:53 p.m.: Marshawn Lynch kicking it with Barry Sanders in a pre-game segment. This is what you love to see. It looks like two legends can co-exist.\n7:40 p.m.: Aaron Jones' return should offer Love a much-needed reprieve. Green Bay's run game hasn't been all that effective thus far \u2014 the Pack are averaging just 3.4 yards per carry so far this year. But Jones is a dynamic force coming out of the backfield, someone capable of carrying an offense on his back for large portions of a game. That's a young QB's dream.\n7:30 p.m.: Jordan Love and the Packers heading onto the field ahed of tonight's game!

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size This story is part of the Good Weekend October 7 edition. See all 15 stories . Melissa Lucashenko, the only person ever to have won both the Miles Franklin Literary Award and TV\u2019s Millionaire Hot Seat, is struggling to concentrate. We\u2019re sitting on the back terrace of the Avid Reader bookstore in Brisbane\u2019s West End, drinking coffee in the late-winter warmth, which even in August is hinting at humidity. We\u2019re shaded by a fig tree, which bursts with bird life. To me, it feels lush and subtropical. Peaceful even. But Lucashenko is distracted by a particular bird that\u2019s dropping fig rubble all over us. \u201cSorry, that bloody bird is really annoying me, that\u2019s a pest bird,\u201d she says, breaking off our conversation. \u201cIndian mynas, I hate \u2019em.\u201d That the Indian myna is an import \u2013 introduced to Australia in the 1860s \u2013 seems apt. We\u2019d been deep in discussion about colonial Brisbane, the hanging of the Aboriginal resistance fighter Dundalli, and the gestation of Lucashenko\u2019s new novel, Edenglassie, published last week by University of Queensland Press. It\u2019s a historical epic which depicts the fascinating period in Brisbane\u2019s history when the former penal colony was morphing into a settler town, and Aboriginal people still outnumbered white colonists. In the book (named after Brisbane\u2019s early moniker), the two groups coexist uneasily at the Queensland \u00adfrontier, their interactions defined by mutual curiosity and suspicion, economic co-dependence and outbreaks of violence. \u201cI\u2019d wanted to write a novel of \u00adcolonial Brisbane for a very long time, since I read Tom Petrie\u2019s Reminiscences of Early Queensland,\u201d Lucashenko says, having refocused after the myna interruption. \u201cIt is so full of stories and insights into the colonial era that as a novelist I just went, \u2018Wow. This is begging to be fictionalised.\u2019 \u201d Edenglassie had a long gestation. It was back in the 1990s that Lucashenko devoured Reminiscences, a 1904 classic that records the memories of the great Queensland pioneer Petrie, a Scottish-born explorer, gold prospector, logger and grazier who lived in the Moreton Bay penal colony, subsequently Brisbane, from 1831 to 1910. The book embedded itself in her consciousness and stayed there for the ensuing decades, as she moved to different homes over the east coast and overseas, as she wove through marriage and divorce, and navigated the challenges of having young children, and the challenges of having grown children, and the torture and exhilaration of writing through it all. Loading \u201cI just had this vague awareness that I should be living in Brisbane to write this book,\u201d she says now, firmly in Brisbane, which is verdant and infested with aforementioned noisy wildlife. \u201cBecause it\u2019s very different to write a book when you\u2019re walking the streets every day and looking at the river every week, than trying to do it at a distance.\u201d She\u2019s dressed casually in a T-shirt and trousers, finished off with borrowed thongs (her shoes were stolen from her house this morning). Her eyes are brown, expressive and kind, but she\u2019s wary of too many personal questions.\nAdvertisement\nLater, I look up Reminiscences, which I\u2019ve never read. It was written by Thomas\u2019 daughter Constance Petrie, who states of her father that \u201cno one now living knows more from personal experience of the ways and habits of the Queensland aborigines. [His] experiences amongst these fast-dying-out people are unique, and the reminiscences of his early life in this colony should be recorded.\u201d These fast-dying-out people: Lucashenko is one of them. The writing of Edenglassie might have been \u00adinspired by this fascinating historical text but its \u00adexistence also represents a giant f--- you to it. When Melissa Lucashenko was awarded the Miles Franklin in 2019 for her novel Too Much Lip, the judges called it \u201ca novel of celebratory defiance\u201d. The novelist\u2019s first reaction to news of her win was \u201cBugger me dead!\u201c, which neatly sums her up as a writer: unpretentious, frank and on easy terms with vernacular. The 56-year-old is a thoroughly contemporary novelist who uses Aboriginal language liberally in her work, and who depicts modern Aboriginal life with urgency and humour. \u201cThat was really the impetus for this book, to say, \u2018This is what was, and we\u2019ve survived it,\u2019 \u201d she tells me. Lucashenko receiving the Miles Franklin award in 2019. Credit: AAP In the historical part of the novel, set in the 1850s, Lucashenko tells the story of Mulanyin, a heroic young fisherman from saltwater country in the south, who works with Thomas Petrie as a young man. Mulanyin falls in love with Nita, who has lived with the Petries as a servant girl-cum-ward since she was a small girl. He dreams of buying a boat and taking his beloved home to Yugambeh country, but evading the colonial system to live a traditional life is becoming harder and more dangerous. The book uses the impending calamity of colonialism to tragic effect. The reader knows what\u2019s going to happen but the characters don\u2019t \u2013 some of them think the British might still go back home. In the other narrative thread, Lucashenko tells a story set in Brisbane in 2024, in which the centenarian grandmother Eddie trips on a tree root and goes to hospital. This event brings together her feisty granddaughter, Winona, and young doctor Johnny, who has just discovered his Aboriginal ancestry and is playing at being a blackfella, much to Winona\u2019s contempt.\nAdvertisement\nLucashenko says there\u2019s a \u201cwhole demographic of people who have an Aboriginal ancestor, who sometimes think they\u2019re Aboriginal, but actually, regardless of skin colour, they\u2019re white people and they have to go on a very long and different journey if they\u2019re going to become Aboriginal\u201d. Skin colour, she says, \u201cis not \u00adirrelevant but it\u2019s almost irrelevant\u201d. Lucashenko\u2019s grandmother, Eleanor.

It\u2019s sitting in a native fig tree, you know, it should be full of fig birds. It should be full of magpies and butcher birds. It should, actually, be full of cat birds and bloody parrots but we are in the middle of West End, and there hasn\u2019t been cat birds and parrots here for a hundred years \u2026 so it\u2019s that kind of understanding.\u201d Also, she adds: \u201cF---ing up the simple \u00adbinaries of black and white is a lot of what I\u2019m about\u201d. The book\u2019s dual time-stamp structure is an attempt to render in words what Lucashenko has called the \u201cdouble-vision\u201d of Aboriginal people: the layering of the structures of modernity on the ancient landscape of their ancestors. \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong economic and social and psychological drive in non-Aboriginal people to see us as, if not dead, then very diminished,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil probably 10 years ago, I would have said the trope of the dying race was, ironically, immortal. But now there\u2019s so much about us in the media all the time, and in the education system to an extent, most Australians have to recognise that Aboriginal people haven\u2019t died out.\u201d Loading (Census data shows the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has in fact risen \u2013 from 548,368 in 2011, to 649,171 in 2016, then up 25 per cent to 812,728 in 2021. This increase is attributed in large part to people feeling more comfortable identifying as Indigenous, and also to the growing popularity of genealogical research.) That Aboriginal people were not all killed off in the early days of settlement was despite the best efforts of some colonists; one of the historical events that inspired the book was the public hanging of the Indigenous warrior Dundalli, the last person publicly executed in Queensland. Labelled on his death \u201cone of the most guiltiest and most incorrigible of the aboriginal natives of this quarter\u201d by The Brisbane Courier, Dundalli evaded capture for 14 years before being convicted in 1854 of two murders (the charges may have been trumped up). In 1855 he was hanged on gallows erected on Queen Street, but the execution was horribly botched. The executioner misjudged the length of the rope and had to swing on the hanged man\u2019s body to finish off the killing.\nAdvertisement\nAboriginal resistance leader Dundalli, in a sketch made before his \u201chorribly botched\u201d public hanging in Brisbane, 1855. Credit: State Library of Queensland \u201cIt\u2019s really a historical fulcrum, the grotesque hanging of Dundalli in the middle of town in front of everyone: black, white, soldier, civilian, everyone,\u201d Lucashenko says. \u201cThe way it was done, with the hangman having to use his own body weight to kill this resistance leader, to me that was a microcosm of the brutality and the spectacle of colonisation, and that was one thing that I really wanted better known. Just the inherent drama of it, as well as the historical importance.\u201d As a novelist, Melissa Lucashenko is preoccupied with survival, and as a person, she knows a lot about it. Born to an Aboriginal mother, Cecile, and a Russian-speaking Ukrainian father \u2013 Vladimir Lucashenko, known as Wally Lucas, whose family fled the Russian Revolution via China \u2013 she and her six older brothers grew up on the outskirts of Logan, south of Brisbane, in circumstances where the chances of becoming an \u00adauthor, let alone a celebrated one, were remote. \u201cMy father was a meatworker and a cane cutter \u2026 Mum worked at a fish and chip shop and sold plants at the local markets,\u201d Lucashenko says of her family background. \u201cMum left school in about grade three or four. She was a domestic from a very young age, as her mother and grandmother were. At one point as a young mother she was working three jobs. \u201cDad went to high school but I\u2019m not sure how far he got. As a child, he was in an orphanage in Brisbane at one point with his brothers, after his father was violent, and his mother needed to escape.\u201d Lucashenko did not know she was of Aboriginal \u00addescent until she was 15 years old, when someone she knew \u201cpicked it\u201d and said to her, \u201cYou\u2019re Aboriginal \u2026 go home and ask your parents.\u201d About that time, a photo appeared on her mother\u2019s dresser of \u201cthis very black woman\u201d, Lucashenko says. \u201cI said, \u2018Who is that photo of that Aboriginal woman?\u2019 \u201d she recounts. \u201cMy mother said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s my grandmother. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve all got olive skin and dark hair.\u2019\u201d Lucashenko was shocked at the revelation, and felt \u201cmomentary \u00addisquiet\u201d (something she attributes to internalised \u00adracism) but says it \u201cinstantly made sense\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nLucashenko\u2019s mother, Cecile.

She was arrested and jailed for a week. In court, she told the judge she\u2019d acted in self-defence, and he found her not guilty. Her perpetrator was jailed for six months instead. The would-be rapist was an Aboriginal man. \u201cNo way she would have gotten away with shooting a white \u00adassailant,\u201d Lucashenko says. \u201cMy mother \u2026 was determined that her daughter would have the chances she didn\u2019t.\u201d On leaving school in 1983 at the end of year 12, Lucashenko worked as a barmaid, a delivery truck driver and a support worker for women out of prison. She used to be obsessed with karate and has a black belt in it. In 1990, she graduated from Griffith University with an honours degree in public policy, having been the first in her immediate family to go to university. \u201cMy mother had no education and was determined that her daughter would have the chances she didn\u2019t,\u201d Lucashenko says. \u201cThere was no skipping school in my household. I was always in the library if I wasn\u2019t on the back of a horse ... I was taken up to the headmaster\u2019s office in grade one and made to read aloud and they all oohed and ahhed.\u201d She published her first book, Steam Pigs, in 1997. It won the Dobbie Literary Award for women\u2019s fiction and she was away, publishing three more books over the next 15 or so years. [In 2018 she told The Sydney Morning Herald that \u201cAustralia is a profoundly racist country and that is why I write more than anything else\u201d]. She married \u2013 her husband Bill worked as a foreign aid specialist for AusAID \u2013 and had a son and a daughter. They moved around for her husband\u2019s job, living in Canberra and on overseas postings, including in Tonga. Eventually the family settled on Lucashenko\u2019s ancestral land, Bundjalung, in the northern coastal area of NSW, \u00adbuying a property and raising horses. But that idyll ended in 2007, when Lucashenko and her husband divorced. She couldn\u2019t afford to stay on the land and worried about becoming a \u201cbag lady\u201d. Around that time, her 16-year-old daughter was hospitalised with mental health difficulties and the two of them moved back to Logan City, poor again. As she said in an address at the 2013 Melbourne Writers\u2019 Festival: \u201cI knew what life was like in a suburb where the majority of people were ordinary, decent Australians, but a significant minority were prepared to sell their children\u2019s Ritalin in order to fund a heroin habit.

After his teacher announced there would be a prize for whoever drew the ship, the young Vincent got sketching.\n\u201cYeah, I won the prize,\u201d Namatjira tells Guardian Australia with a grin, decades later. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time.\u201d\nMany more prizes would follow.

Photograph: Yavuz Gallery\nThe western Arrernte artist Albert Namatjira (1902-59) was one of the most well-known Aboriginal figures in 20th-century Australia, painting watercolour landscapes that blended western influences with a unique perspective on country. The elder Namatjira and the Hermannsburg school of artists became a cultural phenomenon but, despite fame and success, Albert faced legal and health troubles that illustrated a gap in this country.\nThat gap \u2013 between white and black Australia \u2013 has also influenced his great-grandson\u2019s life. Born in Alice Springs in 1983, Vincent was moved to Perth with his sister and placed in foster care after their mother\u2019s death. At 18 he returned to central Australia with little connection to his mother\u2019s home beyond his surname.\n\u201cGetting off that flight, you see a lot of people coming,\u201d he recalls of landing in Alice Springs. \u201cA lot of old ladies, a lot of young people, everybody crying.

Photograph: Max Mackinnon\nEventually Vincent settled in the community of Indulkana in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands, started a family of his own and began to paint. The image of his great-grandfather has loomed large in the work he has created since 2012 \u2013 from the 13-panel series Albert\u2019s Story in 2014 to a 2023 portrait that formed part of his Desert Songs series \u2013 but Vincent has never sought to imitate the recognisable style of his ancestor.\n\u201cWe have both had to fill our legacies,\u201d he says. \u201cI want the audience to see my work and my name, Vincent Namatjira, with the work of modern art \u2013 more portraits, figurative.

{"title":"A new hydrogel could help pull drinking water from the air","context":"## A new hydrogel could help pull drinking water from the air\n\nThis is another in our series of stories identifying new technologies and actions that can slow climate change, reduce its impacts or help communities cope with a rapidly changing world.\nWe all need clean water to survive. Yet across the planet, more than one in every four people live in places without enough. And climate change is making this worse. Now scientists have created a new salty gel. It sucks record-breaking amounts of moisture out of the air to make fresh drinking water \u2014 even in dry climates.\nCarlos D\u00edaz-Mar\u00edn is a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. His team is developing a device to address water shortages. They want it to affordably pull water from air without a need for electricity. The key ingredient: a new, super-salty gel.\nA hydrogel is a mesh of large molecules called polymers. The new hydrogel captures humidity \u2014 water vapor \u2014 from the air. As it does so, it expands like a sponge in water. Later, when heated by the sun, this material will release the water it has absorbed.\nThe idea is not new. Many types of hydrogels have been developed to suck water from air. Previous work showed that adding salts to hydrogels upped how much water they could absorb. Because of their chemical properties, salts attract moisture, including from the air. But no one knew how much salt a hydrogel could stash \u2014 nor how pushing that salt content to the max might boost the hydrogel\u2019s water-slurping power. D\u00edaz-Mar\u00edn and his team decided to find out.\nGetting salty\nThe researchers made tubes of hydrogel from a material called polyacrylamide (PAH-lee-uh-CRIH-lah-myde). That\u2019s a polymer made of long, threadlike molecules. They cut the tubes into thin disks and then soaked them in water containing different amounts of lithium chloride, a salt. Each day, the researchers weighed the disks to see how much of the salty water they had absorbed.\nSuch tests had been done before, but for relatively short times, D\u00edaz-Mar\u00edn says. \u201cInstead of soaking for two days, we did this for up to two months.\u201d The extra time made a big difference.\nThe gels soaked up more and more saltwater over time. The top absorber got about three times saltier than previous hydrogels. It cached 20 grams (0.7 ounce) of salt per gram of gel. It absorbed more moisture than previous gels, too.\nDisks of this hydrogel swell as they absorb salty water loaded with lithium chloride. Graeber et al\/Advanced Materials 2023 ( CC BY 4.0\nTo test this, the researchers dried their gels and placed them in environments with different levels of humidity. Even in relatively dry air, such as that found in deserts, the best-performing hydrogel absorbed 15 percent more water than previous hydrogels.\nThe team reported its findings May 18 in Advanced Materials.\n\u201cWe did this in a very simple and low-cost way, which makes it even more exciting,\u201d says D\u00edaz-Mar\u00edn. His team still needs to test how to get all that water out of the gels afterward.\n\u201cI am impressed by their results,\u201d says Swee Ching Tan. \u201cThis could be a new world record.\u201d He\u2019s a materials scientist at the National University of Singapore. Tan works with hydrogels but did not take part in this study.\nThe new work, he says, could help with the water crisis by producing safe drinking water in places that lack it.\nEducators and Parents, Sign Up for The Cheat Sheet Weekly updates to help you use Science News Explores in the learning environment Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\nMore food, less water\nEarth\u2019s freshwater supply is falling due to climate change. By 2050, more than five billion people are expected to lack water at least one month per year. Some shortages are due to warmer temperatures and less snow to feed into rivers. That puts stress on supplies of water for drinking and growing crops.\nWhatever the cause, better water-slurping gels could make it easier to grow food in such water-stressed places \u2014 including those plagued by drought.\nTan\u2019s team has developed a gel-based device called the SmartFarm. This tiny greenhouse with a moving roof grows crops without having to add water. In the evening, the top opens. Gels inside capture water from the night air. A solar-powered motor closes the roof during the day. When warmed by the sun, the gel releases its water. Tan\u2019s team used the SmartFarm to grow a leafy green vegetable called Ipomoea aquatica.\nSome farmers have used hydrogels to water crops in another way. They mix the hydrogels right into the soil with seeds. There, the gel soaks up irrigation water and holds it close to the sprouting plant. Without the gel, water might soak too deeply for the roots to reach. In one study, adding hydrogels to soil reduced by 30 percent how much water was needed to grow food.\nA device called SmartFarm collects water from the air. It allows plants to grow without watering them. It could be used to grow crops in dry places.\nThe MIT team is also designing a hydrogel-based device. Rather than grow food like the SmartFarm, it will produce drinking water. D\u00edaz-Mar\u00edn explains how it would work: At night, an open box containing their gel captures water vapor from the air. The next day, the sun heats up the hydrogel in the box, releasing the moisture. The box also contains a material that can be cooled without using electricity. When the water vapor touches that cold surface, it condenses into droplets \u2014 like the morning dew on grass. Once condensed, the clean water falls into a storage chamber.\nThe team is working to engineer a device that can extract 2 to 5 liters (0.5 to 1.3 gallons) a day. That should supply someone\u2019s average drinking-water needs.\nAs places get drier, new sources of drinking water will be needed. It\u2019s great that hydrogels can make water anywhere, says D\u00edaz-Mar\u00edn. For ultra-dry places with few other options, he says, they could be a lifesaver.\n\nThis article, authored by Laura Allen, was published by Science News For Students on 2023-11-03 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":285}
{"title":"Bringing aqueous rechargeable zinc iodine batteries to the mainstream energy market","context":"## Bringing aqueous rechargeable zinc iodine batteries to the mainstream energy market\n\nNew research aims to improve the stability and safety of alternatives to rechargeable lithium-ion batteries using aqueous zinc and hydrogels.\nThe demand for rechargeable batteries as a result of the growth of both the personal electronics and electric vehicle markets has grown steadily over the last decade. Lithium-ion batteries are one of the technologies that have emerged and matured due to this demand.\nIn 2020, Statista estimated that lithium-ion batteries accounted for 185 gigawatts (GWh) of energy consumed, and this energy demand is projected to reach 2,035 GWh by 2030. Most of this growth is accounted for by the increased desire for electric vehicles as people turn away from fossil fuels.\nWhile it is undeniable that lithium-ion batteries are more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels and while they are also relatively inexpensive, these batteries aren\u2019t perfect. One of the major drawbacks of these lithium-ion batteries is the inherent risk of burning or even explosion as the result of thermal runaway, with overheated lithium-ion batteries deemed responsible for a number of fires in the past.\nA possibility with zinc\nOne potential substitute for lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable zinc iodine batteries , which have the advantage of being safer, costing less, and being more friendly to the environment than lithium alternatives.\nHowever, zinc iodine batteries are not perfect. Composed of an negative iodine electrode and a positive zinc electrode , these batteries suffer from issues like lower energy output compared to commercial non-aqueous lithium batteries and the growth of zinc dendrites on the anodes \u2014 projections of material that build on electrodes and short batteries when they cross from one electrode to another \u2014 as well as the corrosion of the zinc anode that result in reduced efficiency and even short-circuiting.\nIn a new paper published in the journal Advanced Materials, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences professor Hongjin Fan and his co-authors examine different electrolytes for aqueous zinc ion batteries that take the form of hydrogels \u2014 three-dimensional network structures that are capable of storing large amounts of water \u2014 to address some of these challenges.\n\u201cThe core concept of our research is that we design the hydrogel electrolytes by introducing functional groups [specific groupings of atoms within molecules that have their own characteristic properties] that carry either positive or negative charges,\u201d Fan said. \u201cOur idea is to use a hetero-hydrogel to mitigate challenges on both the anode and the cathode sides of the zinc iodine batteries.\u201d\nA hydrogel boost\nFan explained that the purpose of this hydrogel modification is to ensure that when zinc accumulates on the anode side, it does so evenly. This has the effect of mitigating the diffusion back and forth of polysulfide between anode and cathode, the so-called \u201cshuttle effect\u201d, which can cause poor cycling stability and severe anode corrosion in batteries. The use of a hydrogel electrolyte also has the effect of accelerating the iodine conversion reaction on the cathode side.\nFan explained that the anode and cathode of the hydrogel have different functional groups that make it both zincophilic (with an affinity for zinc ) and iodophilic ( with an affinity for iodine), respectively.\nOn the anode side of the battery, this has the effect of repelling dissolved polyiodides \u2014 negatively charged ions composed entirely of iodine atoms \u2014 allowing the zinc to be deposited uniformly, protecting the anode from iodine-caused corrosion.\nThe polyiodides are immobilized at the cathode side of the battery, and reactions in which iodine is both stripped of electrons (oxidization) and also granted electrons (reduction) \u2014 so-called \u201credox reactions\u201d \u2014 are sped up thanks to the synchronized rapid transport of ions and electrons.\nThe solid nature of the hydrogel electrolyte can also limit the growth of dendrites thanks to its mechanical strength, which acts as a physical barrier not present in liquid electrolytes.\nTentative first steps\nTesting their aqueous hydrogel-modified zinc iodine batteries battery, the team found that the decay rate was ultralow, with the energy storage capacity of the battery retained to an outstanding level over the course of 18,000 discharge and recharge cycles. This outstrips the stability of currently available zinc iodine batteries, and their test battery also delivered some surprising results.\n\u201cThe adhesion between the polyanionic and polycationic hydrogel components is remarkably robust, effectively mitigating the swelling of the hydrogel even in the absence of a cellulose paper scaffold,\u201d Fan explained. \u201cThe unexpectedly strong iodine adsorption capability of the positively charged hydrogel has led to a striking and rapid color transformation, exceeding our initial expectations.\nDespite promising results, Fan acknowledged there is much to do before the battery can be brought to the mass market.\n\u201cWe have to note that in terms of mass or volume energy density, so far, the ZIB is still far from the commercial lithium-ion batteries,\u201d Fan conceded. \u201cThe hydrogel electrolytes need to be further improved in terms of ion conductivity and stability. In addition, hydrogel electrolytes should be compatible with other battery components, including electrodes and separators.\u201d\nThe researcher also pointed out that large-scale and cost-effective production methods for hydrogel electrolytes are a prerequisite before the aqueous zinc iodine batteries is ready for widescale commercial use. This will include optimizing the production process of hydrogels as well as sourcing affordable raw materials and minimizing waste generated during the manufacturing of these materials.\n\u201cEnsuring the safety and reliability of hydrogel-based batteries is also necessary,\u201d Fan concluded. \u201cRigorous testing and evaluation of the potential environmental impact of hydrogel electrolytes, from raw material extraction to disposal, are vital to meeting sustainability goals and gaining public trust.\u201d\nReference: Peihua Yang, Hong Jin Fan, et al., Hetero-Polyionic Hydrogels Enable Dendrites-Free Aqueous Zn-I2 Batteries with Fast Kinetics, Advanced Materials, (2023).

{"title":"What we expect at Apple's Scary Fast event: M3-powered MacBook Pros and new iMacs","context":"## What we expect at Apple's Scary Fast event: M3-powered MacBook Pros and new iMacs\n\nApple has at least one more trick \u2014 or possibly a treat \u2014 up its sleeve this year. On October 30, the night before Halloween, the company is hosting another event. This one is dubbed \u201cScary Fast,\u201d which is a strong indicator that Apple will have some speedy new hardware to show off. Unusually, Apple is holding this event in the evening. It starts at 8PM ET.\nThis year's iPhones and Apple Watches are out in the wild already, but Apple has a bunch of other product categories that it could focus on here. There's always the chance that we might get iPad updates. But, if rumors are to be believed, Apple's focus during the Scary Fast event will be on Macs and a fresh batch of chipsets to power them.\nM3 chip\nApple won't be talking about speed advancements without having new hardware to discuss. That could all start with upgraded chipsets. It's been nearly 17 months since Apple's M2 system on a chip (SoC) debuted. With many manufacturers having an annual cadence for their chipsets, it may be time for Apple to move onto the next generation. (No, shoving two M2 Max chips together isn't quite the same thing.) For what it's worth, the M2 series debuted 19 months after the M1. So, if Apple announces the M3 at the Scary Fast event, the latest SoC would be arriving after a similar period of time.\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that \"M3 series MacBook Pro\" will be the focus of the event, indicating that the company will have more than one new SoC to reveal. As such, there's a chance that we could see an M3 Pro and maybe even an M3 Max during the Scary Fast showcase.\niMac\nA new 24-inch iMac could make its debut at the Scary Fast event. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that a fresh model is expected to arrive this month. He noted that the iMac is in short supply at Apple retail stores, which is another sign that an upgrade is imminent.\nThe 24-inch iMac is well overdue for a refresh, and there have been rumblings for a while that an M3 variant was in the pipeline. The most recent model was an M1-powered machine that arrived in April 2021. Making the leap to M3 \u2014 assuming that the new chip lineup is more capable than the M2 series \u2014 may make any new iMac worth the upgrade for many users.\nMacBook Pro\nDevindra Hardawar\/Engadget\nThere's a very good chance Apple will have at least one MacBook Pro refresh to show off at the event. Both Kuo and Gurman have indicated that will be the case.\nGurman pointed out that the 13-inch, 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro all currently have extended shipping times on Apple's web store. That's often an indicator that the company is winding down the supply of existing products. Furthermore, Gurman reported that Apple has been testing M3 Max and M3 Pro MacBook Pro models. Those could now be ready for prime time.\nHowever, Kuo doesn't expect Apple to have a huge inventory of new MacBook Pro units to sell this year. He previously didn't anticipate that Apple would start selling M3-powered laptops before the end of the year due to limited supply of between 400,000 and 500,000 units. Unless demand drops, Kuo said supply may remain tight until early 2024.\nMacBook sales have waned this year, mainly due to \"the limited M2 computing power upgrade,\" Kuo wrote on X. That might be a reason why Apple is willing to start shipping M3 MacBook Pros now, even if supply is constrained. Announcing new models just a few days before reporting quarterly earnings could help give investors confidence in the company (recent increases of Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and Apple News+ prices could play into that too).\nIf M3-powered models don't lead to a boost in sales, though, Kuo suggests it's more likely that a MacBook Pro with a new design will arrive in 2025. Furthermore, Apple may try to beef up the division with a more budget-friendly MacBook that has an annual sales target of between 8 million and 10 million.\nUSB-C accessories\nRumors also point to Apple unveiling more USB-C accessories as it shifts away from the Lightning port. Gurman suggests we'll see USB-C versions of the Magic Trackpad, Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard at the event.\nThis makes a lot of sense. Apple ditched the Lightning port in all iPhone 15 models, while it started adopting USB-C on iPads several years back. The company also recently unveiled an Apple Pencil that has a USB-C charging port. This change was prompted by European Union rules that require a standard charging port on certain devices. Having the same port on all Apple devices and accessories will mean consumers have fewer types of cables to worry about.\niPad Pro\nNathan Ingraham \/ Engadget\nWhile Gurman may have poured cold water on the idea, we can't disregard our hunch that we'll see at least one iPad at Apple's event. With the focus likely to be on M3-powered products, the chances are that any new iPad will be of the Pro variety with one of those chips inside.\nIt has only been a year since the most recent iPad Pro debuted. Other than a few small tweaks, Apple only really swapped in the M2 in place of the M1. The next iPad Pro will probably need more changes to make it more palatable for anyone who picked up the previous two models, which means Apple might need more time to get it ready. If that's the case, the company might be content to give the iPad Pro a spec bump for the time being.\nOther iPads could also get a refresh at the event, just in time for the holidays. We won't have to wait too long to find out either way. We'll have full coverage of everything you need to know from the Scary Fast event at Engadget, so while you're waiting for Halloween trick-or-treaters to show up, slip into your jammies, grab a mug of cocoa and join us on Monday evening.\n\nThis article, authored by Kris Holt, was published by Engadget on 2023-10-26 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":287}
{"title":"Fantasy Injury Updates Week 10: News on Justin Jefferson, Ja'Marr Chase, T.J. Hockenson & Curtis Samuel","context":"## Fantasy Injury Updates Week 10: News on Justin Jefferson, Ja'Marr Chase, T.J. Hockenson & Curtis Samuel\n\nAfter turning back the clocks last week, it now gets darker earlier for the foreseeable future. That darkness allows us to see the stars on a clear night, so it's only natural to wonder if the pass-catching stars will shine bright in Week 10 of the NFL season. We already know Tee Higgins and Nico Collins are OUT, while Justin Jefferson, Ja'Marr Chase, and T.J. Hockenson are among the other star pass-catchers beaten up heading into the week. Can we expect them on the field when the action kicks off Sunday?\nBelow, we'll give you the latest news on these ailing pass-catchers and break down how their injuries could potentially affect the Week 10 fantasy landscape.\nWEEK 10 INJURY UPDATES: Early WRs | RBs\nIs Justin Jefferson playing Week 10?\nUPDATE: The Vikings will not activate Jefferson before Sunday's game and have officially ruled him OUT, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\nJefferson (hamstring) is officially listed as \"questionable\" for Sunday's game against the Saints. Kickoff is slated for 1 p.m. ET, but fantasy owners won't have to wait long for news on the star receiver. In order to be eligible to play, Jefferson will need to be activated by 4 p.m. ET on Saturday. Earlier in the week head coach Kevin O'Connell said that it would be \"a little aggressive\" for Jefferson to get back on the field this week. However, the receiver's three straight limited practices were enough for the team to at least weigh the decision, but thankfully, an early answer awaits.\nWEEK 10 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start 'em, sit 'em\nJefferson's fantasy outlook is always through the roof, but it will be interesting to see if that changes with Josh Dobbs under center instead of Kirk Cousins. In addition, K.J. Osborn (concussion) is also listed as \"questionable,\" though his status steadily improved throughout the week from DNP on Wednesday to full practice on Friday. If Jefferson is back, he's a must-start. If Jefferson is out but Osborn returns, both Osborn and Jordan Addison are worth using.\nWEEK 10 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nIs Ja'Marr Chase playing Week 10?\nUPDATE: ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported late Saturday that the Bengals are \"hopeful\" that Chase will play against Houston, but they won't know for sure until after a pre-game workout.\nUPDATE 2: Chase is officially ACTIVE.\nChase (back) appears ready to take his status down to kickoff. According to The Athletic's Dianna Russini, the Bengals' star receiver will work out on Sunday morning and his status will be determined afterward. Chase put a scare into the fantasy community on Wednesday when he was listed as a DNP, but after logging back-to-back limited practices, there is a lot more optimism heading into Sunday. With Tee Higgins (hamstring) already ruled out, Cincinnati will be hoping Chase can feel healthy enough to play when they host the Texans at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday.\nThe Bengals, despite getting a win over the Bills last Sunday, are a beaten-down bunch. Their defense will also be without a prominent edge rusher, Sam Hubbard, complicating matters for a team hoping to stack wins as they compete for an AFC North crown. On the bright side, Joe Burrow appears to be finally healthy and should have no problems targeting Tyler Boyd, Trenton Irwin, and Andrei Iosivas in the passing game. If Chase does end up suiting up, fantasy owners should enjoy an even larger workload than the receiver already had. If he's out, Boyd is a must-start, and you can try one of Cincinnati's secondary receivers in deep leagues.\nWEEK 10 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nIs T.J. Hockenson playing Week 10?\nUPDATE: NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Sunday morning that Hockenson is expected to play against New Orleans.\nUPDATE 2: Hockenson is officially ACTIVE.\nHockenson (ribs) is listed as \"questionable\" for Week 10, but he's already said he plans to play on Sunday. The tight end has dealt with his fair share of injury woes this season, however, he's yet to miss a game. After turning in three limited practices this week, we'll trust that Hockenson is ready to go, especially since he continued to play through the ailment in Week 9 as a big part of the offense with Josh Dobbs under center.\nAs long as Hockenson is playing, he's not being benched in any fantasy format. The tight end projects as a top option at the position and remains the Vikings' leader in targets with 80 on the season. Dobbs enjoyed targeting the tight ends in Arizona and continued that trend in his Minnesota debut. The floor for Hockenson is equivalent to that of a rooftop bar.\nWEEK 10 DFS: DK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nIs Curtis Samuel playing Week 10?\nUPDATE: Samuel is officially ACTIVE.\nSamuel (toe) is expected to play on Sunday when the Commanders take on the Seahawks at 4:25 p.m. ET, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. The receiver was limited in practice thanks to the toe injury that has plagued him since leaving Week 8's game against the Eagles, but barring a setback, he will return to action this weekend.\nThe receiver was working his way into flex territory with a couple of good performances before picking up the injury. However, we wouldn't consider him to be worthy of a fantasy start this week unless you're in a bind. It's unclear whether Samuel will regain the same workload or if he'll be playing in limited action as he works his way back. Jamison Crowder emerged in Samuel's absence and Jahan Dotson has seen his production drastically increase, as well. The wait-and-see approach is the preferred one heading into Week 10.\n\nThis article, authored by Nick Brinkerhoff, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-11 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":288}
{"title":"NFL Week 13 injuries: Browns to start Joe Flacco with Dorian Thompson-Robinson out, Saints' Olave questionable","context":"## NFL Week 13 injuries: Browns to start Joe Flacco with Dorian Thompson-Robinson out, Saints' Olave questionable\n\nWeek 13 is in full swing and teams are starting to truly jockey for playoff position as we rocket down the stretch run of the regular season. Of course, with it being so late in the year, injuries continue to be a predominant storyline to monitor heading into each slate and this weekend is no different. Specifically, the quarterback position in Cleveland has taken an interesting turn with veteran Joe Flacco named the starter against the Rams with Dorian Thompson-Robinson ruled out with a concussion. And that's just one situation that we'll be monitoring below.\nHere's a look at all of the final injury reports for Week 13.\nAll NFL odds via SportsLine Consensus odds.\nChargers (-5.5) at Patriots\nAllen made his return to practice on a limited basis on Friday and is officially questionable for Sunday's matchup in New England due to a quad injury. Meanwhile, Pipkins was also limited on Friday.\nThe Patriots will be down a couple of wide receivers as Douglas and Boutte have been ruled out after not practicing on Friday. For Douglas, he missed the entire week due to a concussion he suffered against the Giants, while Boutte was downgraded on the injury report on Thursday and missed back-to-back days due to an illness on top of his shoulder injury.\nLions (-4) at Saints\nThe Lions just designated Hooker for return, who has been rehabbing a torn ACL he suffered at Tennessee last year, this week so the rookie quarterback was not expected to be activated this week. Meanwhile, Anzalone did not practice at all this week, so his prospects look bleak for Week 13. As for Jackson, he was a full participant on both Thursday and Friday.\nHead coach Dennis Allen told reporters Friday that despite Olave being a full participant in Friday's practice he is still in concussion protocol though has a chance to play. The wideout still has another hurdle to pass to be cleared to play on Sunday so his status is still very much up in the air.\nFalcons (-2) at Jets\nAtlanta is relatively healthy coming into this matchup. Hollins, who injured his ankle in Week 9, participated on a limited basis every day this week, which is encouraging for his prospects to play on Sunday. As for Hughes, he practiced fully all week after suffering a hand injury last weekend against the Saints. Linebacker Nate Landman (thigh) missed practice on Wednesday but will play vs. New York.\nRodgers was once again limited in practice but, as expected, will not be activated this week and will be sidelined as he continues his recovery from a torn Achilles just a few months ago. Meanwhile, Cook popped up on the injury report due to a shoulder injury, but head coach Robert Saleh told reporters Friday that the back should be fine.\nCardinals at Steelers (-5.5)\nDespite missing the entire week of practice, the Cardinals are holding out hope for Brown to play by listing him as questionable. McBride is also questionable after being limited on Thursday and Friday, but told reporters that he's \"good to go.\"\nPittsburgh has listed Adams as its lone player with a game designation to wrap up the week. Safety Minkah Fitzpatrick (hamstring) practiced fully throughout the week, carries no designation, and told reporters Friday that he will play this weekend.\nColts (-1) at Titans\nColts : CB JuJu Brents (quad), RB Jonathan Taylor (thumb) OUT\n: CB JuJu Brents (quad), RB Jonathan Taylor (thumb) OUT Titans: WR Treylon Burks (concussion) QUESTIONABLE\nIndianapolis ruled out Brents and Taylor after they both missed the entire week of practice. For Taylor, he underwent surgery on his thumb this week and is expected to miss at least a couple of weeks, which will thrust Zack Moss into a more prominent role in the Colts backfield.\nBurks is the only Titan to have an injury designation entering the weekend, but the wideout was a full participant in Friday's practice. However, he will need to clear the final stages of concussion protocol in order to play.\nDolphins (-9.5) at Commanders\nEvery player who the Dolphins listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Washington was able to practice on a limited basis on Friday. That includes Cotton and Lamm, who both were DNPs earlier in the week. Rookie running back De'Von Achane was a full participant in Friday's practice and head coach Mike McDaniel said he will play this week after missing time with a knee injury.\nWashington could be without its starting center this weekend as it plays host to Miami. Larsen, who missed Wednesday's practice due to a knee injury, was limited on Friday and is officially listed as questionable. Meanwhile, the Commanders will play Week 13 without Forbes Jr., who has been sidelined since suffering an elbow injury against the Giants in Week 11. Head coach Ron Rivera called the injury \"significant\" earlier this week.\nBroncos at Texans (-3)\nDenver's lone player with an injury designation for Week 13 is Mathis, who did not practice Friday after being limited on Thursday. Outside of him, the Broncos are healthy heading into this matchup with Houston. Wideouts Jerry Jeudy (groin) and Marvin Mims Jr. (hamstring) were both full participants on Friday after being limited on Thursday.\nDell logged back-to-back days as a limited participant in practice to end the week and is officially questionable. Brown is also questionable but did not practice Friday due to a knee injury.\nPanthers at Buccaneers (-5.5)\nCarolina may be down two tight ends this weekend as the club has ruled out Hurst and is listing Tremble as doubtful. This is the third straight game Hurst will miss. The team will also be without Bell and will likely look to rookie Alex Cook to start. Meanwhile, corner CJ Henderson (concussion) was a full participant on Friday and carries no designation heading into the weekend.\nTampa Bay is pretty banged up coming into Week 13, particularly on the defense side of the ball. The Bucs will be without key pieces David, Dean, and White when they play host to Carolina. Meanwhile, Godwin did not practice Friday after being added to the injury report on Thursday with a neck injury.\n49ers (-3) at Eagles\nEach of the 49ers' questionable players were limited Friday and did not practice the previous two days. Armstead has stated that he will suit up on Sunday.\nPhiladelphia saw the return of tight end Goedert at practice on Friday. He was limited for the session and officially listed as doubtful after practicing for the first time since suffering a fractured forearm against the Cowboys on Nov. 5. As for Cox, he is questionable despite not practicing Friday due to a groin injury.\nBrowns at Rams (-3.5)\nBrowns : QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson (concussion), WR Marquise Goodwin (concussion), CB Denzel Ward (shoulder) OUT; C Nick Harris (knee) QUESTIONABLE\n: QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson (concussion), WR Marquise Goodwin (concussion), CB Denzel Ward (shoulder) OUT; C Nick Harris (knee) QUESTIONABLE Rams: S Quentin Lake (hamstring) OUT; OLB Michael Hoecht (knee) QUESTIONABLE\nThe Browns have officially ruled out Thompson-Robinson due to a concussion he suffered last week against Denver, which will thrust veteran Joe Flacco in as the starter for Cleveland in Los Angeles.\nFor the Rams, Hoecht didn't practice the last two days after being a limited participant on Wednesday.\nChiefs (-6) at Packers\nKansas City is relatively healthy coming into Week 13. McKinnon was a limited participant on both Thursday and Friday, so his prospects of playing on Sunday appear to be trending in a positive direction. As for Bolton, he is still on IR and working his way back from a wrist injury.\nGreen Bay will be without Jones as the running back continues to deal with a knee injury. Reed returned to practice Friday after missing both Wednesday and Thursday due to a chest injury, while Alexander -- who has missed six of the Packers 11 games this year -- was limited throughout the week.\nBengals at Jaguars (-8.5), Monday\nBengals : CB Cam Taylor-Britt (quad\/ankle), D'Ante Smith (knee), Jay Tufele (illness) OUT\n: CB Cam Taylor-Britt (quad\/ankle), D'Ante Smith (knee), Jay Tufele (illness) OUT Jaguars: CB Tyson Campbell (hamstring), RB Travis Etienne (ribs), TE Brenton Strange (foot), TE Luke Farrell (toe) QUESTIONABLE\nThe Bengals got good news on the injury front ahead of Monday's game against the Jaguars. Wide receiver Tee Higgins (hamstring\/ankle) and linebacker Logan Wilson (ankle\/foot) are set to play, according to head coach Zac Taylor. Higgins and Wilson were full participants in practice. Cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt hurt his foot in practice and is out.\nFor the Jaguars, Travis Etienne (ribs) is also expected to play, Doug Pederson told reporters, despite the running back being limited in practice all week. Strange was a late addition to the injury report, not practicing Saturday.\n\nThis article, authored by Tyler Sullivan, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-12-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":289}

{"title":"6 games to play first on your new Nintendo Switch","context":"## 6 games to play first on your new Nintendo Switch\n\nMany games are huge. Others are endless. Some are so exciting that they swallow our news feeds whole. That\u2019s where Polygon\u2019s What to Play comes in: We curate the best, most innovative, and most intriguing games on every platform, so you can spend less time searching, and more time playing.\neCongrats, you are the owner of a Nintendo Switch! It\u2019s a wonderful position to be in, as the console has a robust, delightful library of games. Plus you not only get to play them on a television screen or monitor; you can also take the console with you wherever you need to go. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that there are tons of cute Joy-Con colors, a great pro controller, and lots of themed peripherals for fans of all stripes.\nThe hardest part is where to even start, in terms of sorting through your options. Luckily, we\u2019ve got six recommendations, ranging from modern Nintendo classics (that you can\u2019t play on any non-Nintendo console) to indie games that are perfect for the Switch.\nIt was really and truly difficult to narrow it down to just six \u2014 there\u2019s so much great stuff out there! \u2014 so if you\u2019re looking for more recommendations, definitely check out the 22 best Nintendo Switch games, 36 best couch co-op games for Nintendo Switch, and the best Nintendo Switch games for grown-ups.\nThe best classic Nintendo Switch games to play first\nNintendo is home to some of the most iconic gaming franchises, and a great place to start for any first time Switch owner is with these modern-day Zelda, Mario, and Animal Crossing games. While it\u2019s hard to pick just a handful from this wealth of options \u2014 not to mention other iconic Nintendo series \u2014 we\u2019ve narrowed it down to some of the platform\u2019s absolute best.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nThere are two standout Zelda games for the Switch that have gained the status of modern classic: Breath of the Wild and the sequel that came out this year, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. While both of them are masterful accomplishments \u2014 putting Link in an open world, and reimagining the scope of what is possible in exploration and puzzling \u2014 we\u2019ve gone with Breath of the Wild as the starting point, because it\u2019s where this iteration of Link\u2019s story kicks off (and because it\u2019s extremely accessible to newcomers). It has all of the joy of exploration on a vast map, as Link can climb and glide all over, without mechanics introduced in the sequel that can be overwhelming (as well as expansive).\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons\nAnimal Crossing games have long been loved for their chill farming sim vibes and adorable villagers, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons perfected the genre. Great for newcomers to consoles and veterans of the genre alike, the game sticks you on an island where you get to design a cute house, harvest materials, catch bugs and fish, and court animal villagers. Time passes as it does in real life, so the game paces itself perfectly for daily engagement with tasks to accomplish \u2014 and fees to pay Tom Nook, the raccoon that lends you all of your supplies and lodging.\nEven more fun, you can visit other friends\u2019 islands. So if you\u2019ve got friends who also have the game on Switch, they can give you a tour, and lend you a hand in the form of gifting bells or other items.\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nIn a sea of truly excellent Mario games, Super Mario Odyssey stands out as the choice for the Switch. This game was released specifically with this console in mind, and it perfectly mixes classic, whimsical Mario platforming with the expansiveness of a large world. You get to run around tons of different maps \u2014 this notably includes my favorite metropolitan area in any Switch game, New Donk City \u2014 some of which reference past installments of the franchise. There\u2019s also lots of power-ups and critters to turn into, courtesy of partner character Cappy \u2014 you get to play as a T-Rex in a segment of the game \u2014 and hidden collectibles for the exploration inclined. Collect Power Moons and save the day. The world is your oyster.\nAcclaimed indie games perfect for the Switch\u2019s portability\nWith so many celebrated indie games, it can be hard to know which platform is the best to play them on. Here are three of our absolute favorites for the Switch.\nHades\nIn Hades, you play as Zagreus, prince of the underworld, fighting your way out of hell and onto the surface in this truly excellent roguelite. It\u2019s got a fantastic, full cast of gods who give you various powers you can mix and match during the course of each run. But these deities are just one of many lovable, complicated, and extremely hot characters you meet along the way, as Zagreus\u2019 story unfolds. Each run where you die doesn\u2019t feel like a loss \u2014 the story is simply that propulsive. There are so many weapon and buff combinations to try, you\u2019ll be eager to hop into your next playthrough, making the Switch\u2019s portability crucial. Hades is for the Greek mythology nerds, but it\u2019s also for everyone.\nStardew Valley\nSolo developer and composer Eric Barone created both a game and a phenomenon with this one, which is inspired by the Harvest Moon series. In Stardew Valley you inherit a farm from your grandfather, and move in as you\u2019re eager to leave the corporate life behind. Farm, mine, fish, and make friends with the locals in Pelican Town. It\u2019s so easy to think to yourself \u201cjust one more day\u201d and then lose hours, days, and months even to building out your farm, wooing a townsperson, and completing community bundles. The multiplayer is also excellent, as you can share a farm with up to three other players.\nHollow Knight\nYou\u2019re a lonely knight, wandering through the crumbling halls of an enormous and wending kingdom \u2014 home to a defunct civilization of bugs \u2014 with only a nail as a weapon. But not to worry: your arsenal of attacks and powers grow the more you explore and defeat bosses. Hollow Knight is one of the best Metroidvanias (and Souls-likes) on the Switch, owing to its precise platforming mechanics, its memorable cast of characters, and a sprawling map full of secrets. There\u2019s no better feeling than doing a little digging and then finding an entirely new region on the map. Hollow Knight captures that feeling \u2014 and you\u2019ll want to take the game with you.\n\nThis article, authored by Nicole Clark, was published by Polygon on 2023-12-24 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":292}

The defense absolutely biffed the cross-examination of Ellison and, to make matters worse was unable to keep a recording of an all-hands meeting where Ellison confessed to taking customer funds from being played for the jury. Is this really the best the defense can do?\nIn Cohen\u2019s disorganized cross-examination, he mostly bored the jury\nBefore this case, I had been told that Everdell and Cohen were \u201cworkman-like,\u201d which I took to mean that they were unshowy but competent. I now believe that comment was an insult. I have been waiting for a juicy cross-examination, as I live for chaos and drama. I am beginning to think I am not going to get one.\nEllison had given, in her direct testimony, fairly damning evidence tying FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to the conspiracy to take FTX customer funds. There were fake balance sheets, one of which was sent to crypto lender Genesis. After a Genesis representative received the balance sheet, he texted Ellison to tell her he\u2019d spoken to Bankman-Fried \u2014 strongly suggesting that Bankman-Fried was aware of the contents of the fake balance sheet. Not great!\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\nBut a lot of testimony relied on Ellison recounting conversations she\u2019d had in person, or on auto-deleting text messaging platforms. This gave the defense an opportunity to try to make her sound unreliable. After all, she had an incentive to flip on Bankman-Fried: the possibility of leniency in her sentencing. Given her fun tweets about speed, the fact that she was Bankman-Fried\u2019s ex-girlfriend, and that she\u2019d apparently written a bunch of stuff down, I was expecting fireworks. For the first time in this trial, maybe the defense had an opening.\nInstead, I got a sad trombone. In Cohen\u2019s disorganized cross-examination, he mostly bored the jury. At one point, two different jurors appeared to be asleep.\nMidway through the morning I began wondering if there was a mercy rule for cross-examinations. Prosecutor Danielle Sassoon had run an effective direct examination, creating an easy-to-follow narrative. By contrast, Cohen appeared to be bumbling around, taking up one topic only to abruptly pivot. Sure, we\u2019re still in the prosecution\u2019s case, but Cohen had all night to prepare his lines of questioning.\nApparently, Alameda had a problem with retaining accountants\nWe established that Bankman-Fried had a much larger appetite for risk than Ellison. I thought perhaps it might be building to something, but this line of questioning was quickly dropped. We established that Bankman-Fried and Ellison reacted differently to stress, and that they also had different approaches to media: namely, that Ellison avoided it while Bankman-Fried sought it out. Okay?\nWe discovered that there was one accountant at Alameda in 2021, and two more junior accountants were hired in 2022. Apparently, Alameda had a problem with retaining accountants, which didn\u2019t surprise me much; CEOs generally don\u2019t do the balance sheets for their companies. I was ready to hear this pursued further \u2014 but then it, too, was dropped.\nI think the defense was also trying to suggest that the government had coerced Ellison\u2019s testimony, by suggesting that she had pleaded guilty to a charge of defrauding investors that she couldn\u2019t have been involved in. After all, she didn\u2019t prepare materials for them. Unfortunately, she did say that she had conversations with investors as part of their due diligence \u2014 and, of course, Alameda was taking on losses from FTX to keep FTX\u2019s balance sheet pristine. This line of questioning felt like a waste of time.\nThere were rather a lot of sidebars during the cross-examination, to the point that when one occurred, several jurors looked entertained. There were a few yesterday, too, including one in which the prosecution complained that Bankman-Fried was visibly scoffing at Ellison\u2019s answers, according to the court transcript. (I did observe him occasionally shaking his head, and sometimes quivering at points during her testimony, but didn\u2019t have a view of his face.)\nAt one point, Ellison appeared to even be toying with Cohen\nAs we were approaching lunch, several jurors looked annoyed, and Cohen looked clueless. He asked Ellison to define what \u201cbuy on the way down\u201d meant, as though it were a term of art. (It means what you think it means, to purchase an asset that\u2019s losing value.) This seemed to puzzle her. At other times, Cohen seemed to forget what she had testified to, bringing up things she hadn\u2019t said. I don\u2019t know if this was an attempt to trap her in a lie or just poor preparation, but much like FTX employee Adam Yedidia before her, Ellison was fastidious about making sure a question was clear and her answer was precise.\nAt one point, Ellison appeared to even be toying with Cohen. She\u2019d testified on direct about Luna, a cryptocurrency token. It had a sister token, Terra, that was a paired algorithmic stablecoin. (If you don\u2019t understand what that means, it doesn\u2019t matter, because they were both nonsense.) Cohen asked her about Terra\/Luna and she pointed out she\u2019d only spoken about Luna, leaving him to fumble about how to explain the relationship between the two tokens. She kept a straight face on the stand while I chuckled from the press seats.\nDuring the opening statement, Cohen had blamed Ellison for not taking out a hedge on some of the risks Alameda was trading. We heard more about this hedge in cross-examination, and friends, it was stupid. Forget evaluating the trade itself (hedging being long crypto by selling Nasdaq futures). Was she supposed to have taken more customer funds to put on the hedge? Was that the defense, that she didn\u2019t take enough of them? Was it that she should have taken them sooner? What the fuck?\nWhen Sassoon got up for a quick redirect, she demolished any points Cohen had attempted to make. But I didn\u2019t really appreciate her cleverness until after Ellison left the stand, and the jurors left the room. She\u2019d managed to set a neat little trap for Cohen.\nIn the recording, Ellison did indeed confess to stealing customer funds with Bankman-Fried\u2019s approval\nOn the direct examination, near the end, Sassoon asked about an Alameda all-hands meeting, without bringing up many specifics. During the cross, Cohen asked Ellison what topics were covered in the meeting, while avoiding details. That opened the door for Sasson on redirect to work in that Ellison had confessed to stealing billions of FTX customers\u2019 money, at Bankman-Fried\u2019s direction.\nThere had been an open question of whether jurors would hear the tapes of Ellison\u2019s remarks. The testimony set up an argument for the prosecution to bring in those tapes. The judge ruled in favor of the jury hearing the recordings and we briefly recessed.\nThat was when Bankman-Fried\u2019s mother approached the defense lawyers.\nThe late afternoon was short and snappy. Christian Drappi, a former Alameda software engineer who looked like a handsome funeral director in a black suit and tie, testified briefly to set up the tape. When Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, announced on Twitter that he intended to acquire FTX, Ellison confessed the theft of customer funds to him and a few other employees, Drappi said. The all-hands took place the following day, and was secretly recorded by an employee who\u2019d joined Alameda three days before.\nIn the recording, Ellison did indeed confess to stealing customer funds with Bankman-Fried\u2019s approval. Drappi said he resigned less than 24 hours after the meeting. The recording was later sent to Drappi, who sent it to the government. Joseph Bankman, the defendant\u2019s father and a senior advisor to FTX\u2019s philanthropic arm, wasn\u2019t in the room for the recording. Barbara Fried looked unhappy, rubbing her left temple as though she had a tremendous headache.\nAnd in a small miracle of pacing, the government got Zac Prince, the founder and former CEO of crypto lender BlockFi, on the stand just long enough to blame FTX\u2019s bankruptcy for BlockFi\u2019s subsequent bankruptcy before we broke for the day.\nI\u2019ve been asked by some people why the reporting coming out of the trial seems so skewed toward the prosecution. There\u2019s an answer for this: the prosecution has put together a strong, comprehensive indictment of Bankman-Fried\u2019s behavior at FTX and Alameda. The defense, so far, has managed to do almost nothing in response. I don\u2019t know if Cohen and Everdell have bad facts, a bad client, or are simply untalented themselves (or some combination of all three?). But I do know that I haven\u2019t yet seen any good reason to doubt the very convincing story I\u2019m hearing from the prosecution.\n\nThis article, authored by Elizabeth Lopatto, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-12 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":293}
{"title":"Bills vs. Bengals live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Sunday Night Football' game","context":"## Bills vs. Bengals live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Sunday Night Football' game\n\nFolks, the Bengals are back.\nWhen Cincinnati began the season 1-3, including a pair of blowout losses in which they scored just three points in each game against the Browns and Titans, it sure seemed Joe Burrow's calf injury would wind up holding the team back in what appeared to be one of their best chances to finally win that elusive Super Bowl.\nSince that loss to Tennessee, it's been the Bengals of old. And that team showed up again on \"Sunday Night Football\" against the Bills. Cincinnati jumped out to an first-half, 21-7 lead against Buffalo, and the defense did the rest, limiting the Bills to just 11 points the rest of the game as the Bengals won their fourth straight, beating the Bills 24-18.\nMORE: Is Damar Hamlin playing vs. Bengals on SNF?\nFans expected this to be an offensive showdown against two premier quarterbacks. And after the first three drives of the game, it sure appeared that's how it would go. The Bengals scored an opening-drive touchdown on just nine plays, matched quickly by a Bills' scoring drive of seven plays and 3:15. The Bengals re-took the lead on a 5:28 scoring drive to wrap up the first.\nFrom there, however, \"Mad Scientist\" Lou Anarumo's defense kept Josh Allen and the Bills off balance offensively for most of the remainder of the game. The next four drives of the half went punt, interception, punt, end of half.\nBurrow and the Bengals, meanwhile, hit a few bumps in Buffalo territory, but scored a touchdown on their final drive of of the first half to take a two-score lead into the locker room. Buffalo picked up a field goal on the first drive of the second half and held the Bengals to just three points in the second half, but it wasn't until 3:32 left that Allen finally got the Bills back into the end zone, with a 17-yard strike to Diggs and a subsequent 2-point try to make it a six-point game.\nMORE: Watch 'Sunday Night Football' live with Fubo (free trial)\nThe Bengals had the ball back with 3:32 left, but put the trust in No. 9, having him start the put-away drive with a 32-yard deep shot to Tyler Boyd to put the Bengals quickly in Buffalo territory. Joe Mixon ran three times to pick up the final first down needed to allow Burrow to kneel out the contest.\nIn a highly anticipated rematch between Allen and Burrow, it was the Bengals' signal-caller that once again came out the better in both the win column and the statsheet. Burrow completed 31-of-44 passes for 348 yards with a pair of touchdowns, while Allen went 26-for-38 with 258 passing yards, one passing touchdown and an interception. He also rushed eight times for 44 yards and another score.\nWith the win, the Bengals move into the final wild-card spot behind the Steelers and Browns, while the Bills are bumped down to the outside-looking-in of the AFC playoff race.\nSporting News tracked live scores and highlights from the \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup.

The Bengals can kneel the game out and will win 24-18.\n11:19 p.m.: Mixon rushes for four yards to bring up a third-and-4 at the Bills' 37, and bring up the two-minute warning. A first down will win the game for the Bengals, since Buffalo cannot stop the clock. A stop on third will bring up an interesting decision for Zac Taylor and Cincinnati.\n11:17 p.m.: Mixon rushes for two yards after the big gain, and the Bills use their final timeout with 2:37 left.\n11:17 p.m.: Feels like a time to run the ball, right? Well, not to the Bengals, who trust Burrow to air out a deep pass to Boyd for 32 yards to the Bills 43.\nBurrow and Boyd get the @Bengals past midfield on the first play of the drive\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #BUFvsCIN on NBC\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https:\/\/t.co\/T6GLEfxpQv pic.twitter.com\/SOTyFnyzp7 \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 6, 2023\n11:16 p.m.: Bengals start the drive at the 25.\n11:13 p.m. Bills scoring play: There's the big strike Bills fans have been waiting for. Allen fires a deep shot to Diggs, who beat rookie corner DJ Turner for the 17-yard touchdown. The Bills convert on the two-point conversion, throwing again to Diggs to make it a six-point game. Bengals 24, Bills 18\n11:12 p.m.: Bills move quickly into the red zone, as Allen connects with Shakir for three yards then a short pass to Murray for six yards. Third-and-1 at the Bengals' 17 with under four minutes to play.\n11:11 p.m.: Another familiar pattern for the Bills: Sherfield catches a pass for nine yards, then Murray powers ahead for two to pick up the first down at the Bengals' 26.\n11:11 p.m.: The call on the field stands: incomplete pass. Bills face second-and-10, trailing by 14 with 5:33 left and only one timeout left on the board.\n11:08 p.m.: Allen scrambles right again, and gets 11 yards. His next play is rules incomplete on a pass that just skips in too low for Sherfield. The Bills are challenging the play.\n11:05 p.m.: Allen hits Shakir for a quick pass, and his speedy receiver takes it up for nine, but Allen is rushed on the next play and fires out an incompletion to avoid the sack from Hubbard. Latavius Murray gets his first carry and picks up two and the first down to the Bengals' 48.\n11:04 p.m.: Allen goes right back to his trusted tight end, even after the fumble, with Kincaid catching a nine-yard pass to start the drive.

Bengals 24, Bills 10\n10:59 p.m.: Another toss play outside to Mixon goes for a loss of three, but Burrow finds Smith, who picks up eight yards to the Bills' 2 before he steps out of bounds. Third-and-goal at the 2, with the Bengals knocking on the door.\n10:57 p.m.: Burrow to Higgins has been the top combination all night, and it is again on the third down play. They connect for 18 yards, with Higgins catching a slant and races it to the Buffalo 7. First-and-goal with less than 10 minutes to play.\n10:56 p.m.: Mixon picks up four yards on a run up the middle, but Burrow throws the ball away on the second-and-6. Bengals use their third and final timeout with 10:19 left before a third-and-6 play.\n10:53 p.m.: Burrow finally connects on the big shot to Chase. His star wide receiver finds some open space, and he catches a 32-yard pass up to the Bills' 29.\n10:52 p.m.: Why run it on third-and-1, when Burrow can call a play action then connect with Hudson for 17 yards up to the Cincinnati 39.\nTanner Hudson had 4 total catches this season entering today.\n\nHe has 4 in this game alone \ud83d\ude31\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #BUFvsCIN on NBC\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https:\/\/t.co\/T6GLEfxpQv pic.twitter.com\/HnhhsUL8In \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 6, 2023\n10:50 p.m.: Irv Smith drops a pass on first down, but who else but Higgins makes a leaping grab for nine yards over the first down marker. Before the third-and-1 play, the Bengals call a timeout, their second of the half.\n10:46 p.m.: A crucial turnover this late in the game. Allen hits Kincaid up the middle, but as the tight end is flipped up in the air, he loses his grasp on the ball, and the Bengals recover it at the Cincinnati 13.\n10:44 p.m.: The Bills try some trickery on first down with a lateral and flea flicker, but Allen fires it empty down the right side. He then scrambles for nine before he's stopped by Mike Hilton. He sneaks for a yard as the Bills pick up the first at the Cincinnati 22.\nThird quarter\n10:40 p.m.: Back-to-back plays with Cook, with him rushing for three then catching a pass for six to bring up third-and-1 at the Bengals' 35. Allen then sneaks to the left side to pick up three and the first down to bring the third quarter to an end.\n10:39 p.m.: Allen is putting on the superhero cape to start the drive, powering his way for a 10-yard run to start the drive then hitting Kincaid for 11 yards to quickly get the Bills back into Cincinnati territory at the 44.\n10:36 p.m.: The Bengals try for it on fourth down, but while Burrow connects with Sample, he's brought down three yards shy of the marker. The Bills take over at their own 35.\n10:34 p.m.: Burrow can't connect with Boyd, and it's now fourth-and-5. The Bengals keep the offense out there, but use a timeout with 2:21 left in the third.\n10:33 p.m.: Jordan Poyer blows up a pitch to Mixon, bringing him down for a loss of four. But Burrow to Higgins again, this time for nine yards, to set up a third-and-5 from the Bills' 37.\n10:33 p.m.: Mixon takes a checkdown for five yards, then Higgins hauls in an 11-yard pass to move up to the Bills' 42.\n10:28 p.m.: Irwin fair catches the punt at the Bengals' 42. Could be a pivotal drive for both teams, with the Bengals leading by two scores with 5:06 left in the third.\n10:27 p.m.: Allen is flushed out of the pocket and tries to pick up yardage, but he's brought down by Trey Hendrickson for only a yard.

Bills wind up using their first timeout with 5:54 left in the half and the play clock down to three seconds.\n10:22 p.m.: Burrow again looks Chase's way, and again comes up empty. He has just three catches for nine yards on seven targets. Robbins' punt spots the Bills at their own 9.\n10:21 p.m.: Burrow goes for the deep shot to Chase, but the throw is just a bit short, and the contact with Dane Jackson breaks up the pass. Mixon then catches a dump-off pass, but is brought down for a loss of a yard. Third-and-11 coming up.\n10:20 p.m.: Higgins catches a short pass, but makes a few players miss, moving all the way up to the Cincinnati 43.\n10:19 p.m.: A healthy Burrow can be a game-changer for the Bengals, and he shows it on third-and-4, scrambling out of the pocket and picking up seven yards and the first to keep the drive going.\n10:18 p.m.: Bengals feeding Mixon to start the drive, with him rushing for three then catching a pass for three to set up a third-and-4.\n10:17 p.m.: Williams returns the kickoff to the 16, but a penalty pushes the spot back to the Cincinnati 8.\n10:13 p.m. Bills scoring play: Allen, on a third-and-9, tries to connect with Davis in the end zone, but the ball falls incomplete. Tyler Bass drills the 34-yard field goal to at least get the Bills a few points. Bengals 21, Bills 10\n10:12 p.m.: Pressure to Allen has limited him on each of the past two passes. He avoided a sack by dumping a quick pass, incomplete, off to Cooks, then tries quickly to throw a pass to Cook, who is tackled for a gain of just a yard.\n10:10 p.m.: Allen rifles a pass to Diggs over the head of Nick Scott for a 15-yard pickup to the Bengals' 33. He dumps it off to Cook on the next play for a pickup of eight. Cook rushes for seven to get the first down and move into the red zone for the first time since the Bills' opening drive, setting up Buffalo at the Cincinnati 17 with a first down.\n10:08 p.m.: The Allen-to-Kincaid connection keeps working. He scrambles to the right, then finds Kincaid at the 41 for a nine-yard pickup and a first down to the Bills' 41. He then find Kincaid again, who dives ahead for 11 yards to Cincinnati's 48 to keep the drive moving downfield.\n10:07 p.m.: Bills flagged for ineligible receiver downfield that brings up a second-and-10, but Allen goes right back to Diggs to bring up a third-and-4.\n10:06 p.m.: Sean McDermott talked about avoiding third-and-longs, and the Bills look ready to try and do just that, starting the drive off with a five-yard pass to Diggs to bring up a second-and-5.\n10:05 p.m.: Shakir brings the ball out to the 26 to start the drive.\nSecond quarter\n9:51 p.m.: The clock winds, and that will end the first half. Bengals head to the locker room leading 21-7.\n9:49 p.m.: Allen airs the ball out deep down the left side, and after some discussion, officials rule the play as intentional grounding. That's a huge penalty as it backs the Bills out of field-goal range back to the Bengals' 48. NBC's Terry McAulay says that Allen threw it well past Davis, which is what made it intentional grounding.\n9:47 p.m.: Two more completions to Kincaid, first for four then another for no gain. But Taylor-Britt is injured on the second pass, and the Bengals have to use a timeout to look him over on the field.\n9:45 p.m.: Bills start at the 25, and Allen wastes no time getting Buffalo up the field. He finds Shakir for 22 yards to the 47, then hits Kincaid for 11 to get Buffalo in Cincinnati territory at the 42.\n9:44 p.m. Bengals scoring play: Sample lines up in the backfield, darts out, catches a short pass and races it to the end zone to add to Cincinnati's lead. Bills will have 1:37 with one timeout left in the half. Bengals 21, Bills 7\n9:41 p.m.: Burrow dances out of traffic in the pocket and throws a perfect deep shot to Boyd, but he just loses the handle on it at the 2-yard line. Third-and-7 for Cincinnati.\n9:40 p.m.: Bills looking to keep some time on the clock. Mixon picks up three yards to the 21, and the Bills use their second timeout right away.\n9:37 p.m.: Bengals decide to go for it, and it works out. Chase sneaks past the defender, catches a pass from Burrow and takes it 11 yards to the Bills' 25. That takes this game to the two-minute warning.\n9:36 p.m.: The Bengals get within a yard, with Burrow firing a short pass over the middle to Boyd, who picks up nine yards to set up a fourth-and-1, and another decision for Cincinnati at the Bills' 36.\n9:32 p.m.: Back-to-back incompletions from Burrow out to Hudson and Chase to start the drive. Third-and-10 coming up.\n9:31 p.m.: Irwin returns the punt nine yards to the Bills' 45 yards. Back-to-back Cincinnati drives starting in Buffalo territory.\n9:30 p.m.: Huge sack by the Bengals as BJ Hill gets to Allen at the Bills' 8. Buffalo will have to punt. Huge three-and-out after a disappointing Bengals' offensive possession.\n9:28 p.m.: Cook rushes for six to start the drive, then picks up two yards to the 17 to set up a third-and-2.\n9:25 p.m.: Brown is called for a false start on the field goal try, which was good from 55. The Bengals will have to punt. Bills will start from their own 9.\n9:24 p.m.: Burrow is sacked by Leonard Floyd as he tried to escape at the Bills 37. Offensive holding is declined, and the Bengals will try for a field goal to make it a two-score game.\n9:23 p.m.: Bengals get five yards back on an offsides by the Bills, which they'll accept despite an 8-yard grab by the Irwin. Third-and-10 coming up.\n9:19 p.m.: Cincinnati keeps heading in the wrong direction. Burrow scrambles for a first down, but it's coming back on offensive holding. Now a third-and-15 from the Bills' 37.\n9:18 p.m.: Bengals try for a quarterback sneak, but he's stopped just short. Cincinnati then takes a delay of game, and Cincinnati is now backed up to a third-and-5.\n9:16 p.m.: Hudson remains active in the passing game, catching a nine-yard pass from Burrow to start the drive. The Bills use their first timeout with 8:17 left as the Bengals prepare for a second-and-1 from the Bills' 23.\n9:15 p.m.: Allen makes his first mistake of the game. Taylor-Britt leaps in front of Gabe Davis and picks up his third interception of the season (Allen's ninth of the year). That will give the Bengals excellent field position at the Bills' 32.\n9:14 p.m.: Allen starts the drive trying again to connect with Harty on a deep shot, but it's overthrown.\n9:11 p.m.: Burrow clearly wanted to go for it, but the Bengals decide to punt. Brad Robbins boots it up, and Hardy fair catches the ball at the Bills' 12.\n9:10 p.m.: Brutal false start penalty by Alex Cappa backs up the Bengals, and while Burrow connects with Drew Sample for six, the Bengals are still two yards shy of the marker. Fourth-and-2 coming up, and a decision for Cincinnati at the Bills' 48.\n9:08 p.m.: Bengals keep leaning on the running game with Mixon picking up two, then Williams rushing for five to bring up a third-and-3 at the Bills' 49.\n9:07 p.m.: Chase is tackled for a loss of two, but Mixon makes up for it right away, following Orlando Brown up the middle for a pickup of 12 yards for a first down up to the Bengals' 44.\n9:05 p.m.: The Bengals' offense picks up right where it left off. Burrow starts the third drive by firing a quick pass to Higgins on a curl route for a pickup of 12 to the 34.\n9:03 p.m.: Trenton Irwin returns the kick to the Bengals' 22.\n9:02 p.m.: Allen goes for a deep shot, but he can't connect with Deonte Hardy. Offensive holding is declined, and the Bills will be the first to punt tonight.\n9:01 p.m.: Bills now facing their longest third-down of the day. Cook lost a yard, then Allen is chased out of the pocket and just gets a throw off to Kincaid before he's sacked. Third-and-11 coming up.\n9 p.m.: Allen tries to connect with Trent Sherfield, but Cam Taylor-Britt is called for pass interference. That will move the Bills up 17 yards to the Bills' 44.\nFirst quarter\n8:56 p.m.: James Cook gets his first rush of the game, picking up two yards. That will bring this quarter to an end.\n8:55 p.m.: Bills will take the ball at the 25 on the fair catch at the 2. Just 0:35 left in a high-scoring first quarter.\n8:52 p.m. Bengals scoring play: Hand-off to Mixon, and he bulldozes his way up the middle for the 2-yard touchdown to give Cincinnati the lead again. Bengals 14, Bills 7\n8:51 p.m.: Cincinnati tries twice to get it to Chase, first with Chase being tackled at the 2 on a wide receiver screen and then a leaping grab for Chase in the end zone, where he can't quite hold on after the catch.\n8:49 p.m.: Bengals just miss out on another touchdown. Burrow escapes the pocket, then gets the ball out to Higgins who dives for the pylon.

Third-and-10 coming up.\n8:44 p.m.: Andrei Iosivas is getting involved in the passing game after back-to-back weeks with a touchdown. He catches a nine-yard pass after Burrow rolls out to his right. Mixon then picks up the first by rushing for three yards to the Bills' 42.\n8:44 p.m.: Burrow tries to connect with Ja'Marr Chase, but the throw is broken up.

Read our privacy notice Thanks for signing up to the\nLifestyle Edit email {{ #verifyErrors }} {{ message }} {{ \/verifyErrors }} {{ ^verifyErrors }} Something went wrong. Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nTaylor Swift has revealed when her relationship with Travis Kelce really started.\nThe 33-year-old singer spoke candidly about the romance during a recent interview with Time after she was named the magazine\u2019s 2023 Person of the Year. Speaking to the publication, she said she connected with Kelce in July, after he confessed on his podcast that he tried and failed to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it during one of her Eras Tour shows.\n\u201cThis all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I\u2019m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.\u201d\nSwift also confirmed that when she famously first attended Kelce\u2019s game at Arrowhead Stadium in September, she was already dating the NFL star.\n\u201cBy the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date,\u201d she said.\nThe \u201cBlank Space\u201d singer also acknowledged that although her love life continues to make headlines with every Kansas City Chiefs game she attends, she\u2019s focused on being there for her partner. She specified that she isn\u2019t trying to hide her relationship from the public eye.\n\u201cWhen you say a relationship is public, that means I\u2019m going to see him do what he loves, we\u2019re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cThe opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you\u2019re seeing someone. And we\u2019re just proud of each other.\u201d\nDuring the interview with Time, the Grammy winner addressed how her appearances at Kelce\u2019s games are heavily publicised. So far, she\u2019s attended five of Kelce\u2019s games, including one on 3 December, and she\u2019s often seated in the Kelce family suite during the events.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don\u2019t know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being shown 17 times or once,\u201d she said.\nShe explained that she doesn\u2019t necessarily pay attention to the cameras and fans around her in those stadiums because she is watching her boyfriend play.\n(Denver Post via Getty Images)\n\u201cI\u2019m just there to support Travis,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no awareness of if I\u2019m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.\u201d\nWhen discussing how many Swifties have now started watching NFL games since she started dating Kelce, she quipped about how much she likes the sport. \u201cFootball is awesome, it turns out,\u201d she joked. \u201cI\u2019ve been missing out my whole life.\u201d\nSwift\u2019s effect on the NFL didn\u2019t go unnoticed in October, as one game between the Chiefs and New York Jets - which she attended with some of her famous friends - became the most-watched Sunday NFL show since the Super Bowl LVII in February 2023.\nThe \u201cAll Too Well\u201d singer\u2019s interview with Time marks her first time publicly speaking out about Kelce, who she\u2019s been romantically linked to since this summer, when the football tight end first confessed to attempting to give her his number.\nWhile Swift has attended a few of Kelce\u2019s games since their relationship started, he\u2019s also gone on to support her career. In November, he made his way to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to attend one of her Eras Tour shows. During the concert, Swift gave a shout-out to the Chiefs player when she changed her \u201cKarma\u201d lyrics to reflect their relationship. \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\u201d she sang, letting out a laugh as fans in the audience screamed in response.\nAfter the show, the \u201cStyle\u201d singer was seen running into Kelce\u2019s arms and kissing him, before he whisked her away backstage.\nElsewhere in the conversation with Time, the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer said that she tries not to let the paparazzi get to her, even though so many of her outings with pals go on to make headlines. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve learned I don\u2019t have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don\u2019t matter. Yes, if I go out to dinner, there\u2019s going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends,\u201d she said.\nShe emphasised how her perspective about the media has changed over the years, adding: \u201cLife is short. Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years - I\u2019ll never get that time back. I\u2019m more trusting now than I was six years ago.\u201d\nWith his love life in the public eye, Kelce has also opened up about his relationship with Swift. In an interview withWSJ Magazine, published on 20 November, he described how much he admires her skills as a musician. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I\u2019m learning every day,\u201d he explained.\nHowever, he also acknowledged the heavy public attention around his private life as a result of his relationship, noting he\u2019s \u201cnever dated anyone with that kind of aura around them\u201d. But, according to Kelce, he\u2019s not letting the media affect his relationship.\n\u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m not running away from any of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she\u2019s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-12-06 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":295}
{"title":"Best NHL prop bets tonight: Artemi Panarin, Cale Makar highlight top parlay picks for Rangers-Red Wings, Devils-Avalanche","context":"## Best NHL prop bets tonight: Artemi Panarin, Cale Makar highlight top parlay picks for Rangers-Red Wings, Devils-Avalanche\n\nTuesday night's NHL national games feature an Original Six matchup at Madison Square Garden in addition to a battle between the team that left and the team that took its place. The Rangers and Red Wings will face off at the world's most famous arena as both squads have jumped out to hot starts in the new season. Dylan Larkin is a game-time decision for the Motor City while injuries to the Blueshirts' Adam Fox, Filip Chytil and Igor Shesterkin are making sure some of this matchup's biggest stars will not be watching in uniform. Regardless, there is still plenty of star power on Broadway in what should feature plenty of offense.\nIn the late game, the Devils return to Colorado -- the place they left in order to move to New Jersey -- for a showdown with the Avalanche. Again, injuries are a big part of the storyline here, thanks to Jack Hughes and Nico Hischier out until further notice. But just because injuries might take some of the juice out of these games doesn't mean that SuperDraft isn't giving us plenty of reasons to care. There are some snazzy looking props out there for us to make our bottom line look at lot better than it did earlier this morning.\nSuperDraft users can win 3X the amount wagered if their two-legged player prop parlay hits. If all four of the props below hit, users will win 10x their entry. In other words, a $20 entry fee will yield a $200 payout. the more legs you add to your player prop parlay, the larger your potential payout becomes, but as the long odds indicate, completing a clean sweep is challenging.\nBelow, we'll break down four of our favorite player props for Tuesday night's NHL slate. Users don't necessarily have to parlay all four picks together, though. Instead, you could make separate two-legged parlays to increase your win probability or attempt to hit it big if all four picks come through.\nWin BIG with SuperDraft!

Artemi Panarin, LW, Rangers vs. Red Wings \u2014 OVER 3 shots on goal\nPanarin has registered at least three shots on goal in nine of 11 games this season, going over three in six of those contests. The winger has been up to his usual antics in the new season, but is also seeing some extra ice time under new head coach Peter Laviolette. The Rangers head into this matchup with a makeshift lineup thanks to those injuries that is forcing them to adjust. The absences of Fox and Chytil are a big deal, however, as Panarin loses Fox, who quarterbacks the power play, and Chytil, who centered his line at even strength. Panarin is still all over the ice for the Blueshirts though and is even seeing 18.8 percent of his shifts start in the offensive zone, a welcome sight after the last two seasons with Gerard Gallant behind the bench. The Red Wings have allowed the 11th most SOG this season (371) and the fourth most power play opportunities (46). If the Rangers can play with the man advantage, Panarin should hit this number with ease, but he's enough of a factor at even strength that we like the OVER here anyway.\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS & FANTASY PROPS: How to play SuperDraft\n2. Daniel Sprong, RW, Red Wings @ Rangers \u2014 OVER 2.5 shots on goal\nDespite not being featured in the top six, Sprong is holding down the fort on the third line, averaging five shot attempts per game through the first 12. He's hit the over in five straight, with 18 SOG compared to just eight combined for his two linemates. Sprong does see some work on the second power play unit, but is clearly willing to fire a lot of pucks at the net with his shoot-first mentality on the third line. With the Rangers still figuring out how to deal with the loss of Fox, there should be some opportunities there for Sprong to find at least three shots tonight.\n3. Jesper Bratt, LW, Devils @ Avalanche \u2014 UNDER 0.5 assists\nBratt comes into Tuesday night's action with seven goals and 11 assists in 11 games. The winger came firing out of the gate, but the outlook has changed for the Devils in recent days after losing the superstar center Hughes to injury. Hughes went down after slamming into the boards against the Blues, forcing New Jersey to change things on the fly. The changes have directly impacted Bratt, who was featured on the top line alongside Hughes. With fellow center Hischier also out with an injury, leaving the Devils fairly weak down the middle and trusting Michael McLeod to hold down the fort in between Bratt and Tyler Toffoli. As a result, Bratt has been held without an assist in each of the last two games for a team that's missing a key contributor on offense. And it'll need him to look to score rather than play the role of playmaker. Until the Devils figure things out, we can't trust this team to do anything positive in the offensive zone.\nWin BIG with SuperDraft! Get a free $10 deposit when you use promo code \"TSN\"!\n4. Cale Makar, D, Avalanche vs. Devils \u2014 OVER 2.5 shots on goal\nOver this number in each of the last two, fans will want to see Makar shoot the puck a little more after going under in five of the previous six before his recent hot streak. Facing a Devils team that is reeling thanks to injuries should help Makar's cause with Colorado able to control the play in the Mile High City. He's the team's top defenseman and a key piece to their power play. Barring something unforeseen, Makar will have plenty of opportunities to find three shots before the 60 minutes on the clock run out. And with 5.9 shot attempts per game, it's only a matter of time before they start finding their way on goal.\n\nThis article, authored by Nick Brinkerhoff, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-07 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":296}
{"title":"Major NASCAR Snubs as Autosport Releases the Top 50 Motorsport Drivers in 2023","context":"## Major NASCAR Snubs as Autosport Releases the Top 50 Motorsport Drivers in 2023\n\nAutosport has revealed its annual list of the 2023\u2019s Top 50 drivers. The renowned motorsports publishing brand has continued the tradition since 2002, and every year, the announcement creates some suspense within the racing community. Highlighting the 50 standout performers in motorsports for the year, Autosport has included several NASCAR drivers in the prestigious list.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nWilliam Byron leads the list of NASCAR drivers with a 12th-place ranking as Kyle Larson and 2023 Cup Series champion Ryan Blaney join him. The scarcity of NASCAR drivers in the rankings has raised some eyebrows. With the year producing numerous cases of NASCAR drivers standing out with their consistency and skills behind the steering wheel, let us look at some of the major exclusions from Autosport\u2019s Top 50 Drivers of 2023.\n1. Chris Buescher\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nRFK Racing found a fresh breath of motivation this year. Since Brad Keselowski arrived in 2022, the team has continued evolving on and off the track. While Keselowski has certainly instilled his experience and winning mentality within the team, he failed to produce a race win in 2023. Instead, it was Chris Buescher who outshone the Cup Series veteran with his best-ever season in NASCAR\u2019s premier competition.\nChris Buescher ended his season with three wins, nine top-5s, and 17 top-tens. Two of his three wins in 2023 came in succession at Richmond and Michigan. Buescher continued his dream run in the Cup Series playoffs and eventually finished 7th in the final standings. The #17 Ford Mustang driver could not, however, secure a win in the Round of 8 and did not have enough points to make a case for the championship four race at Phoenix.\nUSA Today via Reuters Jul 30, 2023; Richmond, Virginia, USA; NASCAR Cup Series driver Chris Buescher (17) celebrates in Victory Lane after winning the Cook Out 400 at Richmond Raceway. Mandatory Credit: Amber Searls-USA TODAY Sports\nOverall, he has been one of the season\u2019s standout performers and displayed incredible grit and consistency throughout the year. His performances in 2023 make a strong case for a place in the best 50 drivers of the year.\n2. Denny Hamlin\nFinding a fan of Denny Hamlin in the NASCAR fandom is a tough task. Continuously surrounded by controversy, Joe Gibbs Racing\u2018s #11 Toyota Camry driver has been subject to a lot of criticism. However, his ability as a race car driver has never been in doubt. As the season entered its decisive phase of the playoffs, it seemed like 2023 would be the year Hamlin\u2019s championship drought finally ended.\nThe 43-year-old dominated the first round of the playoffs and was the driver to watch out for. He eventually won his first playoff race in Bristol and cruised to the next round. However, Hamlin revealed recently that a shoulder injury prevented him from being at the best of his abilities as the playoffs progressed. Having to depend much on his weaker arm, Hamlin stayed in contention for the championship four race until the final race in Martinsville.\nHe secured three wins, 14 top-fives, and 19 top-10 finishes in 2023. He also led a whopping 998 laps, which makes his omission from Autosport\u2019s list seem unjustified. He finished 5th in the final standings and was one of the most consistent and best performers of the 2023 NASCAR season. From the looks of it, a championship trophy would have surely put him in the upper echelons of Autosport\u2019s Top 50.\n3. Christopher Bell\nAs unfortunate as Denny Hamlin was, his JGR teammate Christopher Bell must have felt hard done by after an impressive season. The #20 Toyota Camry driver progressed to the championship race for a second successive season. However, a cruel twist of fate waited for him in the season finale at Phoenix Raceway, as he was forced to retire early from the biggest race of his career with a broken brake rotor.\nvia Imago NASCAR, Motorsport, USA Food City Dirt Race Apr 9, 2023 Bristol, Tennessee, USA NASCAR Cup Series driver Christopher Bell 20 wins the Food City Dirt Race at the Bristol Motor Speedway Dirt Course. Bristol Bristol Motor Speedway Dirt Course Tennessee USA, EDITORIAL USE ONLY PUBLICATIONxINxGERxSUIxAUTxONLY Copyright: xRandyxSartinx 20230409_lbm_bs1_024\nBell\u2019s 2023 season has gone under the radar. With an average starting position of 9.6, the 29-year-old was the sole driver to have an average starting position below 10. A win in the Round of 8 race at Homestead-Miami propelled him to a consecutive Championship 4 appearance. Christopher Bell also dominated the qualifying races throughout the season, especially in the playoffs. Bell recorded poles in the first three races of the playoffs to begin his playoff campaign on a superb note.\nThe Joe Gibbs Racing driver finished the season with two wins, 19 top-tens, and ten top-5s in 2023. He eventually finished fourth in the final NASCAR Cup Series standings and was another one of the prominent performers of the calendar year.\n4. Tyler Reddick\n2023 was a year of milestones for 23XI Racing. The team had two drivers in the Cup Series playoffs for the first time since its inception. One of the major reasons behind its success in 2023 is #45 Toyota Camry driver Tyler Reddick.\nAlongside team owner Denny Hamlin, Tyler Reddick was the pick of the drivers in the first round of the NASCAR playoffs. The 27-year-old California native showcased his road course prowess with a win at COTA earlier this year. Carrying the momentum to the playoffs, Reddick won in Kansas in the Round of 16 to gain more traction for his championship push. He also had one of the best average starting positions among the drivers, with an average of 10.167, despite having only two poles to his name.\nWatch This Story: NASCAR legend Kevin Harvick\u2019s unexpected EV confession\nTyler Reddick finished sixth in the final standings and ended the season with two wins, ten top-5s, and 16 top-10s. He also led 470 laps throughout the season and recorded his best-ever finish in the Cup Series. Reddick was among the dark horses for the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series title and certainly held the potential to win the competition.\n5. Ross Chastain\nRoss Chastain\u2018s performance in 2023 was one of the many positives for Trackhouse Racing this season. The 30-year-old Floridian created history in the season finale by becoming the first non-championship driver to win the Championship 4 race since the introduction of the new playoff system in 2014. Driving the #1 Chevrolet Camaro, the \u201cMelon Man\u201d equaled his career-best tally of two wins in a season after victories in Nashville and Phoenix.\nUSA Today via Reuters Nov 5, 2023; Avondale, Arizona, USA; NASCAR Cup Series driver Ross Chastain (1) celebrates his race victory following the Cup Series Championship race at Phoenix Raceway. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\nWhile his on-track expertise was one of the notable points in 2023, his off-track antics didn\u2019t go unnoticed either. Ross Chastain was clouded in controversy after a fistfight with Noah Gragson and on-track altercations with Denny Hamlin and Kyle Larson. While his cutthroat racing style appeased the fans, his driving skills didn\u2019t waver either.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nChastain scored two wins, ten 1op-5s, and 14 top-tens, while leading 640 laps in 2023. He also led the NASCAR Cup Series standings for seven weeks and had a career-best 28 lead lap finishes. Overall, Ross Chastain has been one of the most resilient NASCAR drivers of 2023 and deserves a mention among NASCAR\u2019s very best.\nTwo more drivers to have featured in the 2023 NASCAR season and Autosport\u2019s Top 50 Drivers are Supercars racers Shane van Gisbergen and Brodie Kostecki. While the pair battled for the championship in the Australian racing circuit, they also raced at the Indianapolis road course race earlier this season. SVG had earlier created history by winning in his NASCAR debut at the inaugural Chicago Street Race.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nThese are some major exclusions that could have been featured in Autosport\u2019s annual list. At the same time, motorsports is a vast field with elite competitions taking place the world over. Some fan favorites are bound to be left out.\n\nThis article, authored by Ansuman Abhisek, was published by Essentially Sports on 2023-12-21 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":297}

The Australian dollar was US64.20\u00a2 at the close as the US dollar fell for a fifth straight day, its longest losing streak since July. \u2018Everybody has one eye on the Middle East conflict and one eye on what\u2019s happening with bond yields.\u2019 John Praveen, managing director at Paleo Leon The 10-year Treasury yield came off its 16-year peak, on track for its steepest single-day drop since May, as trading resumed in the US bond market, which had been closed for a holiday on Monday. Ten-year yields tumbled as much as 18 basis points to 4.62 per cent. Fed swaps currently show about a 60 per cent chance the Fed will stay on hold in December, compared with 60 per cent odds on another interest rate rise by then, just a week ago. But while oil prices eased after Monday\u2019s rally, investors were still closely monitoring developments the Middle East.\nIsraeli air strikes attacked Gaza on Tuesday, razing entire districts in the densely populated and impoverished enclave. \u201cEverybody has one eye on the Middle East conflict and one eye on what\u2019s happening with bond yields. The decline in bond yields is the key driver today,\u201d said John Praveen, managing director & co-chief investment officer at Paleo Leon. Loading While the Fed\u2019s dovish comments were helping stocks on Tuesday and investors were being sanguine about the Middle East, Praveen said that view could change if, for example, the fighting spread to other countries in the region. \u201cIf tensions escalate bond yields might decline further because they\u2019re a safe haven, but equities would sell off in that instance because of increased uncertainty and risk aversion,\u201d he said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent, to 33,739.30, the S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.6 per cent. All 11 major S&P 500 sectors were advancing with materials and consumer staples leading gains, while technology was the slowest gainer. Energy was among the laggards after its more than 3 per cent rally on Monday. A measure of US-listed Chinese shares added 3 per cent amid reports that the Asian nation is considering new economic stimulus. \u201cPolicymakers have begun to acknowledge a lesser need for further policy action given financial conditions have tightened considerably after the recent surge in Treasury yields,\u201d said Ben Jeffery at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cThis acknowledgment may have reduced angst around the need for additional rate increases.\u201d Loading Investors will be watching for any hints in the September Fed meeting minutes due on Wednesday that would suggest the Fed may not follow through with the last rise indicated in its economic projections, according to Anna Wong at Bloomberg Economics. Two critical coming indicators for the US economy \u2014 Thursday\u2019s consumer price index and Friday\u2019s University of Michigan consumer-sentiment survey \u2014 may give a more definitive read, she noted.\nBillionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC the current geopolitical environment was the \u201cmost threatening and challenging\u201d he\u2019d ever seen following Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel over the weekend and predicted the US will enter into a recession early next year. The shekel regained its footing as the central bank duelled short sellers to contain the market fallout from Israel\u2019s conflict with militant group Hamas. European gas prices jumped, with Finland on high alert as it suspects a gas pipeline leak in the Baltic Sea was caused by a deliberate act of destruction, fuelling concerns about the safety of Europe\u2019s energy infrastructure. Base metals sank amid fresh fears over property turmoil in China. Tweet of the day\nQuote of the day \u201cThis is as strong a level of confidence in the market that we have seen since before COVID,\u201d said The Leasing Agency group managing director Terence Yeh as the return of international students and a growing number of apartments in inner-city Melbourne provides a shot in the arm for CBD hospitality businesses.

{"title":"The Epic v. Google trial may come down to simple v. complicated","context":"## The Epic v. Google trial may come down to simple v. complicated\n\nCould Google actually lose?\nWhen I walked into the courtroom on Monday morning, it seemed impossible. If Epic couldn\u2019t prove Apple\u2019s walled iOS garden is a monopoly, how could the comparatively open Google do worse against the windmill-tilting Fortnite developer?\nBut now that both sides have made their opening arguments to a jury, I\u2019m not quite as sure. Because while Google spent most of its first day attempting to explain complicated ins and outs of business, Epic was able to paint a black-and-white picture of good and evil with itself as the clear underdog.\nEpic lead attorney Gary Bornstein was tasked with making the case that Android functions as an unlawful monopoly. He did so by basically calling Google a bully and a cheat that \u201cbribes\u201d or \u201cblocks\u201d any attempt to compete with Android\u2019s Google Play store. The result? A status quo where the vast, vast majority of Android app installs are from Google Play, with only a tiny sliver attributable to the Galaxy Store that comes preinstalled on every Samsung phone.\nThe future of Google\u2019s app store is at stake in a lawsuit by Fortnite publisher Epic Games. Epic sued Google in 2020 after a fight over in-app purchase fees, claiming the Android operating system\u2019s Google Play Store constituted an unlawful monopoly \u2014 while Google says its demands would damage Android\u2019s ability to offer a secure user experience and compete with Apple\u2019s iOS. Follow along with updates here.\nBornstein showed jurors charts of Google\u2019s fat app profit margins (70 percent on $12 billion in revenue a year, says Epic) and pointed out several ugly-seeming ways Google has allegedly attempted to keep anyone from taking that money away \u2014 like paying game developers not to build their own app stores or standalone app launchers like Epic did with Fortnite.\n\u201cGoogle pays actual and potential competitors not to compete. Literally gives them money and other things of value,\u201d said Bornstein. \u201cIt\u2019s like Google saying, \u2018Here\u2019s $360 million\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s an actual number you\u2019ll hear about \u2014 why don\u2019t you sit this one out and let me win?\u201d\nThe upshot for consumers, Epic\u2019s earlier legal filings have suggested, is that we pay higher prices for apps than we would if there were more competition and \/ or lower app store and payment processing fees. But while this will probably come up later in the trial, Epic chose to focus more on simply painting Google as the bad guy on day one.\nIt\u2019s not clear how much of that evidence will hold up on closer examination. That $360 million, for instance, refers to an alleged payment that kept Activision from opening an app store that could compete with Google Play. But Activision told The Verge in 2022 that it \u201cnever entered into an agreement that Activision would not open its own app store\u201d \u2014 and Google is now, it says, armed with the evidence to prove it. On Monday, Epic\u2019s attorney admitted Google \u201cwas too clever\u201d to draw up contracts that specifically forced developers not to compete with the Play Store. The overall narrative is compelling, though \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure Google\u2019s opening statement countered it. Google spent its 45 minutes attempting to explain that its dominance over the Android app market isn\u2019t anything nefarious but simply the natural outcome of Google fiercely competing with the iPhone and its iOS App Store, where Google would like the court to believe that competition truly lies.\nIf Google can convince the jury of that, it could be a winning argument in the case \u2014 because obviously, Google doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on app stores or phones in general. \u201cYou cannot separate the quality of a phone from the quality of the apps in its app store, and that means Google and Apple compete against each other,\u201d began Google lead attorney Glenn Pomerantz.\nBut Google wound up spending much of its opening statement attempting to explain away its seemingly bad behavior as normal business practices and didn\u2019t always succeed out of the gate. I did like Pomerantz\u2019s commonsense argument that Google can\u2019t possibly have a monopoly on Android app stores when \u201cevery single Samsung phone comes with two app stores right on the homescreen,\u201d which continued:\nWhen they show these charts that show all these downloads from Play and not from the Galaxy Store, that\u2019s what the Samsung phone users are choosing. They\u2019re touching Play. Nothing\u2019s keeping them from touching the Galaxy Store; it\u2019s just what works for them.\nI called Google \u201ccomparatively open\u201d earlier, and that openness will likely be heavily debated in the weeks to come. Epic promised to \u201cshow that Google has closed off each and every other option\u201d to the Play Store during this trial. But Google points to the simple fact that it allows alternate app channels at all \u2014 something Android rival iOS doesn\u2019t.\nPomerantz boasted that over a billion people have gone through the process Epic portrays as needlessly onerous to get apps outside the Play Store. (Google told The Verge over email that this refers to how many users have enabled the Android sideloading flow, not necessarily followed through with an install.) \u201cA billion people have done it after getting notified of the potential risks,\u201d Pomerantz said. \u201cThat\u2019s because Android users have a real choice.\u201d\nGoogle also took its own turn trying to paint Epic as the bad guy. First, it pointed out how Epic hatched a secret plan called \u201cProject Liberty\u201d to quietly update Fortnite with code to bypass app store fees, get its app kicked off Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores, and sue.\nThen, it showed off a few out-of-context quotes from internal Epic communications \u2014 suggesting that phrases like \u201cHow do we not look like the bad guys?\u201d and \u201cJust planting the nefarious seed now\u201d and \u201cI mean everything we\u2019re attempting is technically a violation of Google\u2019s policy, right?\u201d showed that Epic knew it was breaking bad at the time it did the deed.\nBut Epic mentioned Project Liberty in its own opening statement \u2014 so, by that point, it had already been an hour since it admitted it intentionally broke Google\u2019s rules. \u201cEpic decided to stand up because that\u2019s what you do to a bully,\u201d Bornstein told the jury.\n\u201cAll we know is whatever is in the destroyed chats, as bad as the documents are, is worse.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s possible no examination will be able to take the stink off one of Google\u2019s ugliest moves: the one where Google employees up to and including CEO Sundar Pichai were caught setting sensitive chats to auto-delete to keep them out of a court\u2019s hands. The court has already decided Google should be sanctioned in some way for making potential evidence disappear, and Bornstein used it to plant persistent seeds of doubt in the minds of jury members. \u201cAll we know is whatever is in the destroyed chats, as bad as the documents are, is worse. Or at least it was worse, before they were destroyed.\u201d\nThe best Google could do in response was to plant its own feeble seed with the jury, too: \u201cIs Epic using the chats to distract me from all the evidence I do see?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that Google could have automatically saved all chats for all relevant employees, but just because Google didn\u2019t save some chats didn\u2019t mean it violated antitrust laws,\u201d Pomerantz argued.\nEpic\u2019s opening statements seemed to paint a clearer picture for the jury than those from Google. But things got complicated for both parties when the first two witnesses \u2014 Epic Games Store head Steve Allison and Yoga Buddhi CEO Benjamin Simon, who also appeared in the earlier Epic v. Apple trial \u2014 took the stand.\nBoth Epic and Google spent a long, long time on subtle lines of questioning. You really had to read between the lines to see that Epic was trying to make a point about how Google\u2019s 70\/30 revenue split is probably based on an arbitrary decision Valve made two decades ago with Steam or how Google was trying to make a point that Epic, too, likely believed that an app store provides more value than just payment processing and maybe deserves more money.\n\nThis article, authored by Sean Hollister, was published by The Verge on 2023-11-07 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":299}
