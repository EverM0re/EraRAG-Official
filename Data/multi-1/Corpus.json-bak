Official Cyber Monday mode, which is currently on through Monday, Nov. 27, includes both a ton of deals carried over from Black Friday plus some new ones.\nWe're curating a running list of Amazon's best Cyber Weekend deals, spotlighting some of our favorites and noting when good deals inevitably sell out. Read on for the full rundown, and check back often: We're going to be updating this story incessantly as the sale continues, as well as our even bigger (if you can imagine) list of Cyber Monday deals across more retailers.\nNote: All newly added deals are marked with a \u2728, while deals with a \ud83d\udd25 have dropped to an all-time low price. Amazon's invite-only deals for Prime members are marked with a \ud83d\udce8. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.\nEcho, Fire TV, and Kindle deals\nWhy we like it\nAn Echo Show is a subtle yet game-changing addition to any room \u2014 and for less than $40 with this rollover Black Friday to Cyber Monday deal, there's little reason to not make your life easier. The smart screen responds to Alexa commands that are particularly handy when your hands are full, like asking for measurement conversions mid-cooking, checking the weather mid-rushing out the door, or turning off your smart lights with a sleeping kid in hand. Plus, it's got a 5.5-inch screen and better sound than its predecessor, making it perfect for watching videos or video calling friends and family.\nMore Amazon device and service deals\nAmazon services\nAudible Premium Plus \u2014 $5.95\/month $14.95\/month for four months (save $9\/month; new customers only; get an additional $20 Audible credit)\nEcho Buds\nEcho smart displays\nEcho smart speakers\nFire tablets\nFire TVs\nNote: All Fire TVs come with a free 6-month subscription to MGM+ (a $35.94 value).\nFire TV streaming devices\neero\nKindles\nMiscellaneous Amazon devices\nApple deals\nWhy we like it\nNow that the 64GB 9th generation iPad has been going in and out of stock (you might be able to find it on sale for $229.99), our new favorite iPad deal at Amazon is the 10th generation 64GB model for $349. Compared to the 9th gen, the 10th gen classic iPad has a slightly bigger screen that's now also a Liquid Retina display (10.9 inches versus 10.2 inches), a faster A14 Bionic chip for smoother multitasking, and USB-C charging.\nMore Apple deals\nAirPods\nMacBook\nMac\niPad\nApple Watch\nTV deals\nWhy we like it\nThis 65-inch Fire TV from Amazon hit its lowest ever price this month, and we're not mad about it. With a 66 percent five-star review rating, it's got much to love: Including stunning 4K QLED resolution, adaptive brightness that adjusts to the lighting of your room, the ability to project famous art or personal pics on it when not streaming anything, and, of course, that quintessential Alexa voice control.\nMore TV deals\n43 to 55 inches\n65 inches\n75 to 85 inches\nLaptop deals\nWhy we like it\nMacBooks aside (which are all listed above in the Apple section), another stellar Cyber Monday laptop deal at Amazon is the lightweight Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 3 for $599.99. This 25% discount drops the 2023 version to the regular asking price of our favorite budget laptop, the older Surface Go 2. Compared to the Go 2, the Go 3's Intel Core i5 processor is 12th gen versus the Go 2's 11th gen, harnessing better speeds and solid power for most everyday work or school tasks. On the outside, the Go 3 is definitely giving MacBook Air \u2014 the main difference being that the Go 3's screen is a touchscreen.\nMore laptop deals\nTraditional laptops\n2-in-1 laptops\nChromebooks\nGaming laptops\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nWhy we like it\nNarrowing down a headphones upgrade from so many on-sale options is less overwhelming when you've confirmed that you want to stick with a super premium, super reputable brand like Bose \u2014 but also that you want to stick to a budget. There's only one pair of Bose over-ear headphones you can grab for just under $200, and that's the QuietComfort 45s at a record-low price of $199. This classic pair secures top-of-the-line ANC, 20 hours of battery life, and all-day comfort for less than half of the AirPods Max's sale price.\nMore headphone and earbud deals\nHeadphones\nEarbuds\nTablet deals\nGaming deals\nGaming headsets\nMashable Deals Want more hand-picked deals in your inbox?

{"title":"ASX set to drop as Wall Street\u2019s September slump deepens","context":"## ASX set to drop as Wall Street\u2019s September slump deepens\n\nETF provider Betashares, which manages $30 billion in funds, reached an agreement to acquire Bendigo and Adelaide Bank\u2019s superannuation business, in its first venture into the superannuation sector. Betashares said it was part of a longer-term strategy to expand the business into the broader financial sector. Shares in Bendigo increased 0.6 per cent on the news. REITS (up 0.4 per cent) was the strongest sector on the index as Goodman added 0.5 per cent and Dexus climbed 2.8 per cent. The laggards Casino operator Star Entertainment Group\u2019s shares hit an all-time low of 60\u00a2 after it raised $565 million. They closed the session 16 per cent weaker at 63\u00a2. Star, which raised $800 million in February, has had to return to the market for fresh funding and is hoping to raise $750 million at a share price of 60\u00a2 a share.\nMeanwhile, healthcare heavyweight CSL shed 1.4 per cent, weighing down the healthcare sector and insurance companies IAG (down 2.6 per cent) and Suncorp (down 2 per cent) gave back some of their gains from Tuesday. Gold miners Newcrest (down 2.1 per cent) and Evolution (down 3.5 per cent) were also among the biggest large-cap decliners after the spot gold price dropped 0.9 per cent overnight. Information technology (down 1.1 per cent) was the weakest sector on the local bourse with WiseTech losing 1.4 per cent. The lowdown\nNovus Capital senior client adviser Gary Glover said the Australian sharemarket was surprisingly resilient following a negative lead from Wall Street and the latest inflation data, with markets starting to wake up to the fact that interest rates could stay higher for longer. \u201cConsidering the damage overnight in the US, Australian markets held on pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would be a bigger down day across the board.\u201d Glover said the market was volatile but quite range-bound, similar to previous periods of high inflation in the 1940s and 1970s. Elsewhere, Wall Street\u2019s ugly September got even worse on Tuesday, as a sharp drop for stocks brought them back to where they were in June. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.5 per cent for its fifth loss in the last six days. The Dow Jones dropped 1.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.6 per cent.\nLoading September has brought a loss of 5.2 per cent so far for the S&P 500, putting it on track to be the worst month of the year by far, as the realisation sets in that the Federal Reserve will indeed keep interest rates high for a long time. That growing understanding has sent yields in the bond market to their highest levels in more than a decade, which in turn has undercut prices for stocks and other investments. Treasury yields rose again on Tuesday following a mixed batch of reports on the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.55 per cent from 4.54 per cent late on Monday and is near its highest level since 2007. It\u2019s up sharply from about 3.5 per cent in May and from 0.5 per cent about three years ago. One economic report on Tuesday showed confidence among consumers was weaker than economists expected. That\u2019s concerning because strong spending by US households has been a bulwark keeping the economy out of a long-predicted recession.\nBesides high interest rates, a long list of other worries is also tugging at Wall Street. The most immediate is the threat of another US government shutdown as Capitol Hill threatens a stalemate that could shut off federal services across the country. Loading Wall Street has dealt with such shutdowns in the past, and stocks have historically been turbulent in the run-up to them, according to Lori Calvasina, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. After looking at the seven shutdowns that lasted 10 days or more since the 1970s, she found the S&P 500 dropped an average of roughly 10 per cent in the three months heading into them. But stocks managed to hold up rather well during the shutdowns, falling an average of just 0.3 per cent, before rebounding meaningfully afterward. Wall Street is also contending with higher oil prices, shaky economies around the world, a strike by US autoworkers that could put more upward pressure on inflation and a resumption of US student-loan repayments that could dent spending by households.\nOn Wall Street, the vast majority of stocks fell under such pressures, including 90 per cent of those within the S&P 500. Big Tech stocks tend to be among the hardest hit by high rates, and they were the heaviest weights on the index. Apple fell 2.3 per cent and Microsoft lost 1.7 per cent. Amazon tumbled 4 per cent after the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general filed an antitrust lawsuit against it. They accuse the e-commerce behemoth of using its dominant position to inflate prices on other platforms, overcharge sellers and stifle competition. In China, concerns continued over heavily indebted real estate developer Evergrande. The property market crisis there is dragging on China\u2019s economic growth and raising worries about financial instability. France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 0.7 per cent, and Germany\u2019s DAX lost 1 per cent.\nCrude oil prices rose, adding to worries about inflation. A barrel of benchmark US crude climbed 71\u00a2 to $US90.39. Brent crude, the international standard, added 67\u00a2 to $US93.96 per barrel. Tweet of the day Quote of the day \u201cThe Senate committees have the power to summons witnesses within Australia but have no enforceable powers for witnesses who are overseas,\u201d said Senator Bridget McKenzie as former Qantas boss Alan Joyce chose not to front the Senate select committee into the federal government\u2019s decision to reject extra flights from Qatar Airways due to \u201cpersonal commitments\u201d.\n\nThis article, authored by Stan Choe, was published by The Sydney Morning Herald on 2023-09-26 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":1}
{"title":"Amazon sellers sound off on the FTC's 'long-overdue' antitrust case","context":"## Amazon sellers sound off on the FTC's 'long-overdue' antitrust case\n\nA worker sorts out parcels in the outbound dock at the Amazon fulfillment center in Eastvale, California, on Aug. 31, 2021. Watchara Phomicinda | MediaNews Group | The Riverside Press-Enterprise via Getty Images\nIt was late in the day on Oct. 27, 2021, when Fred Ruckel received the dreaded automated email from Amazon . Amazon\u2019s software had detected that Ruckel\u2019s popular cat toy, called the Ripple Rug, was being sold somewhere else for a cheaper price. His product would no longer be shown in Amazon\u2019s all-important buy box, an area of the listing where shoppers click \u201cAdd to Cart.\u201d Ruckel is the sole seller of the Ripple Rug on Amazon, so the move all but ensured his product would disappear from the website, costing him thousands of dollars per day. \u201cBelow is a list of product(s) in your catalog that are not currently eligible to be the Featured Offer because they are not priced competitively compared to prices for those products from retailers outside Amazon,\u201d according to the email, which was viewed by CNBC. Unbeknownst to him, Chewy was running a discount promotion, and dropped the price of his product by a few dollars to $39.99 \u2013 less than the $43 offer on Amazon. The algorithm had flagged it as a lower offer, even though the item on Chewy cost $48.54 after shipping and taxes. Ruckel had to make a choice: Lower the price on Amazon or ask Chewy to raise the price of his product. He opted for the latter.\nFred Ruckel's company Snuggly Cat makes Ripple Rug, an interactive play mat for cats. Fred Ruckel\nNearly three years later, Ruckel\u2019s experience hits at the core of a sweeping antitrust lawsuit filed last week by the Federal Trade Commission against Amazon. The agency accused Amazon of wielding its monopoly power to squeeze merchants and thwart rivals. For consumers, that\u2019s led to artificially inflated prices and a degraded shopping experience, the agency alleges. In the 172-page suit, the FTC said Amazon relies on an \u201canti-discounting strategy\u201d and a \u201cmassive web-crawling apparatus that constantly tracks online prices\u201d to stifle competition. The agency said Amazon punishes third-party sellers who offer cheaper products elsewhere by threatening to disqualify them from appearing in the buy box if it detects a lower price. Losing the buy box is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to sellers\u2019 businesses, the complaint alleges. The end result of these tactics, the FTC argues, is elevated prices across the web. The company steadily hikes the fees it charges sellers and prevents them from discounting on other sites, so sellers often inflate their prices off of Amazon, creating an \u201cartificial price floor everywhere,\u201d according to the complaint. The FTC is seeking to hold Amazon liable for allegedly violating anti-monopoly law, though it has not yet outlined the specific remedies it believes would best resolve its concerns. In antitrust cases, remedies are often determined only after a court finds the defendant liable. In a blog post, Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky said third-party sellers set their own prices on the marketplace. The company also invests in tools to help sellers offer \u201ccompetitive prices,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with those tools, some of the businesses selling on Amazon might still choose to set prices that aren\u2019t competitive,\u201d Zapolsky said. \u201cJust like any store owner who wouldn\u2019t want to promote a bad deal to their customers, we don\u2019t highlight or promote offers that are not competitively priced.\u201d Zapolsky argued the FTC\u2019s lawsuit could force it to stop highlighting low prices, \u201ca perverse result that would be directly opposed to the goals of antitrust law.\u201d\n\u201cLong overdue\u201d lawsuit\nOn Amazon\u2019s own forum for merchants, called Seller Central, several users cheered on the FTC and said they hoped it would result in changes to the company\u2019s business practices. Amazon\u2019s tense relationship with merchants has been well-chronicled over the years, with sellers expressing a range of grievances over issues like rising fees, an arcane suspensions process, and heightened competition on the marketplace from all sides, including the e-commerce giant. \u201cI think it\u2019s great, Amazon deserves it,\u201d one person commented, adding, \u201cMore should be coming on the way.\u201d Amazon in recent years made the forum anonymous, but users must have a seller account in order to post. Another post included a screenshot of a message Amazon sent to sellers the day after the FTC filed its complaint, which said, \u201cAs your partners, we know that this news may generate questions for you and our business together. This lawsuit does not change anything about our relationship with you or how we operate today.\u201d One user called it \u201cBS verbiage,\u201d adding, \u201cBusinesses that sell in their store are indeed customers. And which of us has gotten good customer service?\u201d Another user described their experience in the last 12 months of selling on Amazon as \u201cbeing up all night at an effing casino but I'm stuck, the drugs are starting to wear off, but I'm trying to break even on the mortgage payment I'm using to play. That's how it is selling on Amazon right now to me.\u201d The seller went on to describe the experience as a \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d \u201cIt's long overdue,\" another commenter wrote. \"When they close me down, I'm applying for a job with the FTC.\u201d Still, others commented that the FTC\u2019s complaint is misguided. \u201cSelling on Amazon is a life-changing opportunity and the amount of sellers that throw stones at the platform is astounding,\u201d one user wrote.\nSeller skepticism\nEven sellers who may be sympathetic to the idea of regulating Amazon have concerns, specifically that the FTC's highlighted issues aren't necessarily ones that would make the seller and consumer experience better. Scott Needham, who sells on Amazon and runs a product-finder tool for other Amazon sellers, said he was \u201csurprised by some of the points that the FTC selected.\u201d\nwatch now\n\u201cI have over the years been very critical of Amazon,\u201d Needham told CNBC. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot of sleep because of some of the things that they have done. And the issues that they brought up, while they are interesting, they haven\u2019t created me a lot of pain.\u201d Needham said he was particularly puzzled by the inclusion of the claims that Amazon is coercive in the way it encourages sellers to use its fulfillment service, known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA. Needham said many sellers \u201clove FBA\u201d because of its compelling value in terms of the price and promise to deliver two-day shipping. For many, using FBA doesn\u2019t feel like a requirement, but they believe using it will make their businesses \"easier and more effective.\" \"I think that the power that Amazon wields over sellers is considerable and absolutely worth looking into,\u201d Needham said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if this would actually change that.\u201d Scott Moller, an Amazon seller and co-founder of an agency that helps merchants run their storefronts, said the e-commerce giant has removed some of the challenges that used to be part of running an online business. With FBA, he said, he can ship an item into one of Amazon\u2019s warehouses for $7.49 per package, while shipping it himself through a traditional carrier would cost him about $12. \u201cI don\u2019t have to have my own warehouse,\u201d said Moller, who sells grilling accessories on Amazon under the brand Grill Sergeant. \u201cI can use their staff, their storage, and I can instantly also take the data of advertising, so I can target ads.\u201d He also disputed the FTC\u2019s claim that Amazon has become littered with ads in search results, causing shoppers to wade through potentially less-relevant products of lesser quality. \u201cWe can tailor our ads to hit exactly the consumers we want,\u201d Moller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect marriage of a transaction, and that\u2019s one of the beauties of what their marketplace offers.\u201d Needham said he feels he would have been more supportive of the case if it were filed a few years ago, pre-pandemic. At that time, he said, \"I would have felt, yes Amazon is a monopoly\u2026 But actually after Covid, into 2023, ecommerce has had a lot of big changes.\u201d He added, \"The competition is just not what it was in 2019.\" Competitors like Shopify and Walmart are increasingly viable alternatives for many categories of sellers, Needham said, not to mention rapidly growing Chinese e=commerce companies like Temu. As a result, Needham said he\u2019s seen some significant changes from Amazon. Among those is a greater ability for Amazon sellers to communicate with buyers, offering select customers certain promotions. Shopify, for example, gives sellers much more control over how they communicate with customers, Needham said, adding that although Amazon still controls the communication process, at least there is one. \"I wish it was a clear-cut case,\u201d Needham said. \u201cI have a vested interest in the marketplace doing really well, as a seller and as a service provider. And... this case, it doesn\u2019t make the marketplace better for sellers.\"\nConcerns over Amazon pricing policies, fees\nMany sellers have zeroed in on Amazon\u2019s pricing policies and rising fees as rightful areas of concern in the FTC's lawsuit. Molson Hart, whose company Viahart sells toys on Amazon, has been a longtime critic of Amazon\u2019s pricing policies. Hart complained of how Amazon\u2019s seller fees impact pricing in a 2019 Medium post and later that year testified about his experience before a House committee. Hart said Amazon sales comprise about 90% of his business, meaning any hit those sales take on Amazon has a considerable impact. He recalled \u201c24 anxious hours\u201d in September 2022 when a third-party seller of his popular construction toy Brain Flakes listed the toy for a lower price on Target than it was offered on Amazon.\nMolson Hart, CEO of Viahart, an educational toy company that sells on Amazon.

{"title":"Christmas Day preview: 49ers, Ravens square off in potential Super Bowl sneak peek","context":"## Christmas Day preview: 49ers, Ravens square off in potential Super Bowl sneak peek\n\nChristmas Day isn't just for the NBA, as the NFL is set to air an exciting triple-header featuring fierce division clashes and a highly anticipated matchup we could see again on Super Bowl Sunday. Here are the top players and storylines to monitor for Monday's slate.\nLas Vegas Raiders (6-8) at Kansas City Chiefs (9-5) | 1 p.m. ET\nNew chapter in Patrick Mahomes-Maxx Crosby rivalry: This hasn't been as much of a rivalry between the teams as of late, with Kansas City holding a 10-1 record over the Raiders since Mahomes became its starting quarterback. Yet it has sparked an exciting feud between the two-time Super Bowl MVP and the two-time Pro Bowler Crosby, who has five sacks in nine career games against the Chiefs.\nMahomes and Crosby might not like facing one another, though it's clear there's mutual respect between the two, which only makes their rivalry more intriguing to watch.\nCan Raiders QB Aidan O\u2019Connell earn next season\u2019s starting job?: After leading the offense on seven touchdown scoring drives in last week's 63-21 win over the Chargers, the rookie fourth-rounder aims to further establish himself as a serious contender for Las Vegas' starting job next season. Despite the encouraging performance, O'Connell has been inconsistent across six games as the full-time starter, throwing for 1,300 yards, seven touchdowns, and five interceptions.\nHowever, a stellar showing against the NFL's fifth-ranked pass defense (202.5 yards per game allowed) would benefit his bid to be the starter in 2024.\nChiefs TE Travis Kelce: Yes, his girlfriend will be in town for the holiday. Kelce is averaging 89.6 yards per game with global popstar Taylor Swift in attendance this season but is coming off his worst outing in her presence, catching five passes for 28 yards.\nEven so, Kelce's 81.3 average receiving yards per game against the Raiders since 2019 suggests the All-Pro tight end is in line for a productive outing and could potentially snap his four-game scoring drought.\nNew York Giants (5-9) at Philadelphia Eagles (10-4) | 4:30 p.m. ET\nWill the Eagles defense shake off the rust?: Appointing Matt Patricia as defensive play-caller didn't change much for the Eagles, whose defense has given up the third-most points in the NFL over their current three-game losing streak (95). Although the unit has reached its lowest point, there are reasons to be optimistic about Monday's matchup.\nNew York ranks 31st among teams in points and yards per game this season and has surrendered a staggering 76 sacks, the third-most in a single season in NFL history. Not to mention, the annual trip to Philadelphia has essentially been a scheduled loss for the Giants, with their last win at Lincoln Financial Field coming in 2013.\nCan QB Jalen Hurts and the Eagles offense finally bounce back?: Philadelphia's defense isn't the only unit that needs to rebound, as the offense has struggled mightily over the last three games, with Hurts' ineffectiveness playing a significant role. After averaging the third-most points in the NFL over the first 11 games (28.2), the Eagles have scored four offensive touchdowns during their current skid, three of which came via the \"tush push.\"\nThe Eagles may have difficulty throwing against a solid Giants pass defense, though they could alleviate some of their offensive woes by running the ball efficiently. New York gives up 131.6 rushing yards per game, the fourth-most in the league.\nDoes Giants QB Tommy DeVito have any magic left?: The Giants may have a terrible offense, but this unit has operated at its best under DeVito, an undrafted rookie and native of Cedar Grove, New Jersey.\nDeVito has thrown for 858 yards, seven touchdowns, and one interception in five games since being named New York's starting quarterback, posting the 13th-highest passer rating in the NFL during that stretch (97.3).\nBaltimore Ravens (11-3) at San Francisco 49ers (11-3) | 8:15 p.m. ET\nPotential Super Bowl sneak peek and MVP implications: Easily the most hyped game of the week, with the top seed in each respective conference squaring off in what could be a potential Super Bowl LVIII preview as well as the decisive clash for the MVP Award.\nAccording to oddschecker, 49ers QB Brock Purdy is listed as the heavy favorite to be named league MVP (-230), while Baltimore signal-caller Lamar Jackson holds the second-shortest odds (+525).\nPurdy, the final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft, has seen his career unfold as if it were a fairy tale that just keeps getting more remarkable. The 23-year-old ranks first in the NFL in QBR (76) and touchdown passes (29) while ranking third in passing yards (3,795), all of which are especially impressive considering he's coming off offseason elbow surgery.\nJackson might not be posting the ridiculous numbers he did during his 2019 MVP campaign, but the adjustment in his play style in his first season under OC Todd Monken has led to sustainable, winning football. Nevertheless, Baltimore needs an upset win for Jackson to capture another MVP Award, as he has thrown for 3,105 yards and 17 touchdowns while adding 741 yards on the ground with five scores this season.\n49ers RB Christian McCaffrey: If Purdy wasn't playing at such a high level \u2014 and the MVP wasn't a quarterback-driven award \u2014 it'd be difficult to argue against McCaffrey taking home the honors. McCaffrey, who seems poised to win the Offensive Player of the Year Award, leads the NFL in rushing (1,292 yards) and total yards per game (128.6) this season and is tied for first in touchdowns (20).\nRavens TE Isaiah Likely thriving in the starting role: The Ravens offense hasn't lost a step since losing one of the team's top weapons in tight end Mark Andrews (ankle) in Week 11, largely due to Likely's emergence.\nThe second-year tight end has averaged 64.3 yards over his last three games, which is particularly noteworthy since Andrews averaged 54.4 yards per game before sustaining his injury.\nShould we expect a defensive battle?: While both teams boast offenses that rank in the top five in yardage and scoring, this may not turn into a shootout. The Ravens defense has allowed the fewest points per game this season (16.1) and second-fewest total yards (4,030), while San Francisco's unit ranks second in points (16.7) and 10th in yardage (310 per game).\nThe 49ers defense might be slightly inferior statistically, but it could have more of an impact in this matchup. San Francisco has racked up an NFL-leading 25 turnovers and has given up the second-fewest rushing yards (1,252), which should help slow down the team with the league's most effective running game.\n\nThis article, authored by Colum Dell, Yardbarker, was published by Yardbarker on 2023-12-24 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":3}
{"title":"Raiders vs. Lions live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Monday Night Football' game","context":"## Raiders vs. Lions live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Monday Night Football' game\n\nThe Lions just needed to get themselves back in the win column after a blowout loss in Baltimore, and they did just that in front of their home fans on Monday night.\nDetroit rolled to a 26-14 victory over the Raiders in a game that felt much more one-sided than the score indicates.\nThe Lions thoroughly outplayed the Raiders, out-gaining Las Vegas by 329 yards, but critical mistakes by Detroit left points on the board. The offense struggled to turn red zone opportunities into touchdowns in the first half, and two turnovers deep in Raiders territory -- including a pick-six by Jared Goff -- kept Las Vegas in the game in the second half.\nMORE: What to know about Lions' retro 'Honolulu blue' helmets\nNonetheless, the Lions' defense dominated. The Raiders were abysmal on the offensive side of the ball, outside of a second-quarter touchdown drive led by Josh Jacobs. Jimmy Garoppolo completed just 10 passes, badly missing a wide-open Davante Adams on multiple occasions.\nAdams was seen slamming his helmet down on the sideline in the fourth quarter, and it's tough to blame the star receiver after an 11-yard performance that could have been exponentially better with better quarterback play.\nThe story of the night was Lions rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, who finally broke through after entering the season with sky-high expectations. Tasked with leading the backfield in David Montgomery's absence, Gibbs exploded for 189 scrimmage yards and a touchdown in the win. It was the first 100-yard rushing performance of his career.\nMeanwhile, Amon-Ra St. Brown notched his third consecutive 100-yard game despite entering Monday as questionable with an illness.\nMORE: Why Davante Adams is unlikely to be traded before deadline\nThe Lions enter their bye in sole possession of the No. 2 seed in the NFC, while the Raiders drop their second consecutive game against an NFC North opponent and have what might be a must-win game against the Giants in Week 9 if they want any chance to linger in the AFC playoff race.\nThe Sporting News tracked live updates and highlights throughout the \"Monday Night Football\" matchup between the Raiders and Lions.

The Lions bounce back and move to 6-2 with the win over Las Vegas. Detroit left points on the board, but the Raiders were thoroughly outplayed in this one.\n11:09 p.m. \u2014 The Lions get the ball back and will try to ice the game at this point.\n11:08 p.m. \u2014 Adding insult to injury, Garoppolo is sacked for the sixth time tonight. It's 4th & 17.\n11:07 p.m. \u2014 Davante Adams has had his way with Cameron Sutton at times tonight, and Garoppolo has just not made the throw each time. It happens again here on what would've been a game-changing play. Garoppolo has had a brutal night.\n11:04 p.m. \u2014 Riley Patterson missed a 26-yard field goal attempt after making his first four attempts tonight. Strange. The Lions can't come away with points on that drive.\n11:01 p.m. \u2014 What would've been a Reynolds touchdown is erased by a holding penalty. That does give the Lions a chance to erase some more time on the clock, though.\n11:00 p.m. \u2014 Craig Reynolds, up to 66 yards, has the Lions on the verge of the end zone.\n10:58 p.m. \u2014 Garoppolo is sacked AGAIN. It's Anzalone for the second time on the drive, and that sends the ball right back to the Lions.\n10:56 p.m. \u2014 Now the Lions sack Garoppolo on back-to-back plays as Alex Anzalone and Alim McNeill come in to send the Raiders to 3rd & 28.\n10:53 p.m. \u2014 Garoppolo hits Jakobi Meyers for a big 19 yards to give the Raiders something to work with.\n10:51 p.m. \u2014 The Garoppolo-to-Adams connection is just not working tonight. Adams was all by himself downfield, and Garoppolo throws it well out of bounds.\nLions 26, Raiders 14\n10:46 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 52 yards? No problem for Patterson, who extends the Lions' lead to 12.\n10:45 p.m. \u2014 Kalif Raymond was set up for a big play, but Goff's throw was just a bit behind him. That will get Riley Patterson on the field for a 52-yard field goal try.\n10:43 p.m. \u2014 Goff gets pushed forward on 4th & 1 to keep the Lions' drive alive. They're into Raiders territory, trying to ice this game.\n10:36 p.m. \u2014 Gibbs is just wearing down this Raiders defense for chunks of yards. He's up to 179 scrimmage yards and has the Lions moving down the field again.\nEnd of third quarter: Lions 23, Raiders 14\n10:32 p.m. \u2014 Gibbs turns what looked like little or no gain into a first down. He has 126 yards on the ground.\n10:31 p.m. \u2014 Alim McNeill sacks Garoppolo for an 8-yard loss, ending Las Vegas' drive. Aside from the second quarter drive dominated by Jacobs, the Raiders' offense has shown nothing tonight. Garoppolo has just 62 yards through nearly three quarters.\n10:28 p.m. \u2014 Michael Mayer gets the Raiders' drive started with a big 19-yard gain. That's the rookie's first catch of the night.\nLions 23, Raiders 14\n10:25 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 There goes Jahmyr Gibbs! It's the rookie's night. He takes off for a 27-yard touchdown with his blazing speed and has 149 scrimmage yards on the night. More importantly, he gives the Lions a two-possession lead.\n10:23 p.m. \u2014 A pass interference call gives the Lions 18 yards and takes them well into Raiders territory after starting the drive with strong field position.\n10:18 p.m. \u2014 The Lions quickly get the Raiders off the field, and a bad drop by Davante Adams on third down is the culprit. The throw was a bit low, but Adams still had it in his grasp for a second. Las Vegas will punt.\n10:16 p.m. \u2014 It was hard to find a conclusive angle of what happened there, but Lions fans are making it known they think Reynolds was down. It doesn't matter. It's Raiders ball with a chance for Las Vegas to take the lead.\n10:13 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 For now, the Raiders force a fumble by Reynolds and instantly end the Lions' drive. Maxx Crosby ripped it right out of his arms. Was he down? That's what officials are taking a closer look at.\n10:11 p.m. \u2014 Another first down by Gibbs, who has 116 scrimmage yards, and the Lions have 1st & Goal.\n10:09 p.m. \u2014 Officials come out to measure whether Craig Reynolds got a first down...and he did. On the next play, Reynolds catches a pass from Goff for 12 yards. The Lions are in business on the verge of the red zone.\n10:06 p.m. \u2014 The Lions have gotten over midfield with two early first downs as they try to steal the momentum back. St. Brown is up to 108 yards on the night.\nLions 16, Raiders 14\n10:01 p.m. PICK-SIX \u2014 Marcus Peters picks off Goff and runs it 74 yards back for the touchdown! Amon-Ra St. Brown didn't have his eye on the throw from Goff, but Peters did. The Raiders are right back in this game.\n10:00 p.m. \u2014 There goes Jahmyr Gibbs! The rookie breaks tackles for a bruising 24-yard run. He's up to 97 scrimmage yards tonight.\n9:56 p.m. \u2014 Julian Okwara sacks Garoppolo on third down, forcing a Raiders punt. The Lions didn't want to let Las Vegas build any momentum to start the half, and mission accomplished.\n9:55 p.m. \u2014 It's quickly 3rd & 9 to start this third quarter after Davante Adams unsuccessfully looks for a pass interference call.\nEnd of first half: Lions 16, Raiders 7\n9:39 p.m. \u2014 The Raiders run one play but elect to go to the half. They'll start the second half with the ball and could use at least some points on that drive if they want to stay in this game.\nLions 16, Raiders 7\n9:36 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 LaPorta's great rookie season rolls on! The rookie picks up his fourth touchdown of the season and extends the Lions' lead. Detroit found success running the ball early, but that drive featured nice work from Goff. 16-7. Lions.\n9:35 p.m. \u2014 LaPorta picks up a first down for the Lions, and now Dan Campbell is going to start using his timeouts with 31 seconds left in the half. Detroit is at the Raiders' 18-yard line.\n9:33 p.m. \u2014 St. Brown picks up another first down for the Lions as they enter field goal range again. St. Brown is up to 94 yards in the first half after entering the day listed as questionable.\n9:30 p.m. \u2014 What would've been a horsecollar penalty on a nice Gibbs run is offset by a holding call. The fans don't like it.\n9:26 p.m. \u2014 There's a welcomed sight for Lions fans: Goff hits Jameson Williams for a 22-yard gain. Williams was held without a catch despite six targets in Baltimore last week.\n9:25 p.m. \u2014 Crosby is doing so much more than just getting to the quarterback tonight. He wraps up Gibbs, the third time tonight he's had an explosive play on a ball-carrier.\n9:21 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 That was a statement drive by the Raiders. Jacobs looked like the dominant runner he was last season and takes it in himself for the game's first touchdown.\n9:20 p.m. \u2014 Davante Adams doesn't have a single catch tonight, but Jacobs has 12 touches. Right now, it's starting to work. The Raiders are set up with 1st & Goal.\n9:19 p.m. \u2014 The Raiders are quickly into the red zone after another nice gain for Josh Jacobs.\n9:17 p.m. \u2014 Las Vegas' offense is moving much smoother now as Austin Hooper picks up another first down. Hooper has two catches on this drive.\n9:15 p.m. \u2014 It's back-to-back first downs for the Raiders, with the help of a 15-yard penalty on Aidan Hutchinson for a low block.\nLions 9, Raiders 0\n9:11 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The Lions' drive fizzles almost instantly, so it's back to Riley Patterson's leg for another field goal. Detroit leads, 9-0.\n9:09 p.m. \u2014 Momentum swings abound. St. Brown comes right back with a 24-yard catch to make up the lost yardage and much more.\n9:08 p.m. \u2014 Maxx Crosby blows up another play, this time dropping Jameson Williams for a loss of six.\n9:06 p.m. \u2014 Big play alert! Goff hits an open Amon-Ra St. Brown, who goes 44 yards to breathe life into the Lions' offense.\n9:03 p.m. \u2014 The Raiders' offense continues to have nothing in the tank. Las Vegas gains four yards and is forced to punt after less than a minute with the ball.\nLions 6, Raiders 0\n8:58 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 Detroit was simply trying to draw the Raiders offsides. It didn't work. Riley Patterson's field goal is good, and the Lions extend their lead to six.\n8:56 p.m. \u2014 Raymond makes up some yardage on fourth down but comes up about eight yards short of the goal line. The Lions may be considering going for it...\n8:55 p.m. \u2014 The Lions are moving backwards after a holding call on Taylor Decker.\nEnd of first quarter: Lions 3, Raiders 0\n8:51 p.m. \u2014 Goff comes under heavy pressure on 3rd & 11 but finds a wide open Kalif Raymond for the first down. The Lions are into the red zone.\n8:49 p.m. \u2014 There's Amon-Ra St. Brown. Goff hits him on back-to-back plays for a total of 20 yards.\n8:47 p.m. \u2014 Garoppolo's fourth down pass goes to no man's land after Hunter Renfrow falls down. The Lions will be set up not too far from field goal range.\n8:46 p.m. \u2014 The Raiders will go for it on 4th & 2 from about midfield...\n8:43 p.m. \u2014 The Raiders' defense rises to the challenge and forces a quick three-and-out. Detroit is punting for the first time tonight.\n8:38 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 And just like that... Jimmy Garoppolo turns it over. That can't happen. Kerby Joseph picks it off just in front of the end zone and gets the ball back to the Lions' offense two plays after the fumble.\n8:36 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 A big mistake from Josh Reynolds, who loses the ball after a catch and sees it quickly scooped up by the Raiders. It's Las Vegas ball deep in Lions territory.\n8:33 p.m. \u2014 Garoppolo fights hard for the first down, using his legs and taking a big hit, but he comes up a yard short. The Raiders will punt.\n8:31 p.m. \u2014 A flag flies on the Raiders' first offensive snap, but it's picked back up as Josh Jacobs takes a pass 12 yards for a quick first down.\nLions 3, Raiders 0\n8:26 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The Lions' running game stalls out, but not before they worked their way into field goal range. Riley Patterson drills one from 44 yards out to put Detroit in front early.\n8:22 p.m. \u2014 With Gibbs getting a breather, Craig Reynolds comes in and delivers a bruising 11-yard run. The Lions are bullying their way down the field.\n8:21 p.m. \u2014 Is this the Jahmyr Gibbs game? He already has six touches and just ran his way to another first down.\n8:19 p.m. \u2014 Gibbs picks up another Lions first down on a catch-and-run. He's heavily involved in the offense early on with David Montgomery out.\n8:18 p.m. \u2014 Goff hands off to Jahmyr Gibbs on the first two snaps of the night, and he hits Sam LaPorta on third down to convert. Nice start for the Lions' rookie class tonight.\n8:15 p.m. \u2014 The Lions will start with the ball, and we are underway!\n8:07 p.m. \u2014 As the broadcast points out, this is a homecoming for Michigan native Maxx Crosby. The play of him and fellow Michigan native Aidan Hutchinson will be pivotal tonight.\n7:56 p.m. \u2014 Josh Jacobs hasn't averaged more than 3.6 yards per carry in a single game this season. Can he get going against a strong Lions run defense? It'll be tough to win without at least some production from the former first-rounder.\n7:40 p.m. \u2014 On that note...

{"title":"UTSA vs. Marshall odds, props, predictions: Roadrunners lay big spread in Frisco Bowl","context":"## UTSA vs. Marshall odds, props, predictions: Roadrunners lay big spread in Frisco Bowl\n\nThe UTSA Roadrunners (8-4) take on the Marshall Thundering Herd (6-6) on Tuesday night in the Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl (9 p.m ET, ESPN). The matchup sees the Roadrunners as large betting favorites on odds boards. Currently, USTA is favored by on the point spread, with Marshall available for on the moneyline.\nThe Roadrunners are in their 13th season as a program but have yet to win a bowl game. This is the fourth bowl game they've played in five years. Marshall is competing in a bowl game for the seventh straight year.\nThese teams have been on different streaks as the year has progressed. UTSA has won seven of its last eight games, while Marshall has lost six of its last eight.\nHere are the live odds, team betting news, player props and our betting prediction for UTSA vs. Marshall in Tuesday's Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl.\nLive odds for UTSA vs. Marshall: Point spread, moneyline, total\nCheck out UTSA vs. Marshall live odds, including the spread, moneyline and total available at the best online sportsbooks.\nMore: North Carolina vs. West Virginia odds in Duke's Mayo Bowl | Best college football betting promos\nUTSA Roadrunners betting news\nUTSA has hit its stride over the second half of the season, before losing 29-16 to Tulane in its last outing. The Roadrunners scored at least 34 points in every win since Oct. 7, proving to be an offensive juggernaut. Everything starts with star QB Frank Harris.\nThe dual-threat QB has completed 64.9% of his passes this season for 2,506 yards and 18 touchdowns. While impressive, he totaled 4,059 yards and 32 TDs on a 69.6% completion rate last year. UTSA's offense is good, but we've seen a better version of the unit in recent seasons.\nStill, Harris' experience and talent often shine through. UTSA's leading receiver Joshua Cephus did the heavy lifting for the unit. He caught 82 passes for 1,049 yards and nine touchdowns. The offense also had four ball carriers with at least 323 rushing yards, so there are plenty of threats for head coach Jeff Traylor to unleash.\nUTSA averaged 31.7 points and 424.6 total yards per game, which rank 37th and 39th in the nation, respectively. Roadrunners opponents ranked 69th in third down conversion rate, but the defense allowed an 87.5% score rate in the red zone (99th).\nUTSA is 5-6-1 ATS and 4-7-1 to the OVER.\nUTSA Roadrunners opting out of Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl\nThe Roadrunners will be without their best defensive player, Trey Moore, as he looks to jump to a Power 5 school. Moore led the conference in sacks, so he's a star-level absence for the unit.\nHere are USTA players who won't play in the Frisco Bowl.\nTrey Moore, EDGE (transfer portal)\nSyrus Dumas, DB (transfer portal)\nXavier Spencer, CB (transfer portal)\nKyle Eaves, WR (transfer portal)\nMarshall Thundering Herd betting news\nThe toughest blow for Marshall in this game is being without second-year starting QB Cam Fancher (transfer portal). Instead, Marshall will start freshman Cole Pennington, who is the son of former Marshall star QB Chad Pennington. Pennington has thrown six interceptions and zero touchdowns on only 79 passing attempts this season.\nMarshall's offense will continue to run through star RB Rasheen Ali. The senior speedster carried the offense even when Fancher was under center, totaling 1,256 yards and 15 touchdowns on the season. This offense has struggled despite Ali's efforts, ranking 93rd in scoring and 89th in yards per game.\nOn the season, Marshall is 4-8 ATS and 6-6 on the O\/U board. The Herd won only three of their eight conference games on the season.\nMarshall Thundering Herd opting out of Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl\nWhile UTSA has the biggest individual loss for this game, the Herd's depth has taken a huge blow thanks to transfer portal entrants.\nChase Harrison, QB (transfer portal)\nBrandon McElroy, DL (transfer portal)\nCaleb Coombs, WR (transfer portal)\nZion Odoms, WR (transfer portal)\nJayven Hall, LB (transfer portal)\nCam Fancher, QB (transfer portal)\nThomas Lane, DL (transfer portal)\nChinazo Obobi, OT (transfer portal)\nMaurice Jones, RB (transfer portal)\nSean Sallis, TE (transfer portal)\nMyles Bell, DB (transfer portal)\nTrent Holler, iOL (transfer portal)\nJoshua McTier, CB (transfer portal)\nJabarrek Hopkins, DL (transfer portal)\nCK Obobi, OL (transfer portal)\nSean Ellis, TE (transfer portal)\nTyShawn Hurst, OT (transfer portal)\nElijah Russell, EDGE (transfer portal)\nUTSA vs. Marshall prop bets at BetMGM Sportsbook\nBetMGM Sportsbook offers some excellent player props for the Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl between the Roadrunners and Thundering Herd.\nFrank Harris prop bets\n237.5 passing yards OVER (-115) \/ UNDER (-115)\nPassing TDs OVER 1.5 (-125) \/ UNDER 1.5 (-105)\nAnytime touchdown scorer (-110)\nJoshua Cephus props bets\n80.5 receiving yards OVER (-115) \/ UNDER (-115)\nAnytime touchdown scorer (-190)\nRasheen Ali prop bets\n80.5 rushing yards OVER (-115) \/ UNDER (-115)\nAnytime touchdown scorer (-175)\nKevorian Barnes prop bets\n64.5 rushing yards OVER (-115) \/ UNDER (-115)\nAnytime touchdown scorer (-135)\nRobert Henry prop bets\nAnytime touchdown scorer (-130)\nUTSA vs. Marshall prediction: Frank Harris leads Roadrunners past the Herd\nEven with the transfer portal hitting this game hard, the UTSA offense will be too much for Marshall to keep up with. The Roadrunners push the pace in a way that Marshall can't replicate, and the Thundering Herd aren't efficient enough to make the most of what few scoring opportunities they'll have.\nThe Thundering Herd could find themselves down several scores by the end of the first frame if Pennington turns the ball over, as he's prone to do. UTSA is a well-oiled machine against teams with similar or worse talent, and Marshall is in that latter category.\nIt's a big number to lay, but we're on the favorite Tuesday night.\nPick: UTSA\n\nThis article, authored by Ian Valentino, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-18 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":5}
{"title":"North Texas vs. SMU odds, props, predictions: Red hot Mustangs could overpower not-so-Mean Green","context":"## North Texas vs. SMU odds, props, predictions: Red hot Mustangs could overpower not-so-Mean Green\n\nThe Ponies are riding high again, having guaranteed their fifth consecutive winning season. Such success hasn\u2019t been seen in Dallas since the years that led to SMU\u2019s ignominious Death Penalty, which suspended its program in 1987 and \u201988.\nSMU is 7-2, 5-0 in its final go-round in the American Athletic Conference. And here comes North Texas (3-6, 1-4), which has dropped four of its past five games and allows 37.4 points to its foes, ninth-worst in the nation.\nThe Mustangs get a national ESPN2 audience Friday in a 9 p.m. ET kickoff.\nWhen looking at North Texas vs. SMU odds, props and predictions, the recent past gives us a pretty good window into what to expect: Over the previous four seasons, SMU has clamped down on North Texas by scores of 48-10, 35-12, 65-35 and 49-27, covering the spread each time and comfortably in all but one.\nNorth Texas at SMU odds: Point spread, moneyline, total\nHere are the latest college football betting odds for the Mean Green vs. Mustangs:\nThis opened Mustangs -14 and an exorbitant total of 71.5 in Vegas, which had shifted to 16 and 67.5, respectively, 24 hours later. Two of our three models have SMU winning by 22 and 18 points, so the spread grabs our attention.\nNorth Texas betting news: There\u2019s no 'D' in Mean Green\nThis will be a challenge for North Texas because SMU possesses a top-10 defense, allowing foes only 0.251 points per play; which only stiffens (to 0.185) when the Ponies play at home.\nThe North Texas defense is 12th from the D-I basement, giving up 0.501 ppp; and an even looser 0.533 on the highway.\nSMU\u2019s 20th-rated offense (0.483) sharpens to a ridiculous 0.662 at home\u2014the only squads more efficient in their own yards are USC (0.780), LSU (0.762), Oregon (0.712) and Washington (0.690).\nThe definition of \u00e9lite.\nUntil he had two passes picked off last Saturday in a 38-20 defeat to UTSA, junior QB Chandler Jones had thrown 262 passes through seven games with 19 TDs and no interceptions.\nJones, who started his career at Louisiana-Monroe, snatched the job from Stone Earle early in the season and hasn\u2019t disappointed first-year coach Eric Morris.\nThe Mean Green defense has been another story, since allowing 681 total yards to Cal in the opener. Its past three foes have rung up 1,460 total yards and 15 TDs. Its yield of 479 yards per game is the worst in the country.\nThat sound you hear is SMU super sophomore QB Preston Stone licking his chops as he read that last sentence.\nMore college football: Best college football betting sites | Top college football bonuses\nSMU betting news: Ponies on a stone-cold winning streak\nThe Mustangs are knotted atop the AAC with fellow 5-0 squads Tulane and UTSA. They\u2019ve accumulated 1,685 total yards of offense in their past three games, including 91 first downs via passing, running or penalty, and 18 touchdowns.\nBy happy coincidence, no doubt for second-year SMU boss Rhett Lashlee, the defense has flexed over that span, yielding just 668 total yards, 39 total first downs and a mere four TDs.\nWhen last seen at Gerald J. Ford Stadium, two weeks ago, rain might have kept fans away as only 20,800 filled the 32,000-capacity barn for SMU\u2019s 69-10 homecoming belting of Tulsa.\nStone, playing near where he was raised, threw touchdown strikes of 74, 62 and 17 yards. By halftime, it was 52-3, the most Division I points tallied in the first 30 minutes this year.\nThe 6-foot-2 sophomore from Dallas has been heating up lately, perfect timing to continue improving SMU\u2019s bowl prospects after a 2-2 start that included keen tests (and defeats) at Oklahoma and TCU.\nThe Mustangs own a five-game winning streak, and in his past four games Stone has thrown 122 passes, 10 for touchdowns and none for interceptions. He\u2019s also run it in twice.\nHe threw for 300 yards against Prairie View A&M, and in this golden four-game stretch he\u2019s accumulated 1,171 aerial yards.\nReceivers RJ Maryland and Jordan Hudson have five TD catches apiece, and Roderick Daniels Jr. has four. Three others have two. Jaylan Knighton (511 yards, four TDs) paces the ground game.\nHowever, Stone\u2019s sterling development might have found a speed bump last week at Rice when he left early in the fourth quarter after getting hit hard. He zipped to the locker room and returned, minus his helmet.\nIf concussion protocol restricts him from playing Friday, look for redshirt freshman Kevin Jennings to start for SMU. He\u2019s thrown 42 career passes, with 33 completions, four TDs and no picks.\nShould Stone not play, we will call an audible and play Under this total. Monitor it closely and prepare to take action within an hour of kickoff.\nNorth Texas vs. SMU props\nPlayer props for North Texas vs. SMU have not been made available at top sportsbooks, but BetRivers is offering several game props.\nAmong them are a pair of team combo specials, pairing first TD and the game's outcome:\nSMU to score first and win: Yes -165; No +123\nNorth Texas to score first and win: Yes +950; No -5000\nNorth Texas at SMU prediction ATS\nAt home, the Mustangs average 0.3 giveaways per game, among the top seven teams in the country. On the road, North Texas coughs it up nearly twice a game, among the bottom third of D-I. Moreover, SMU is one of 14 programs that are the best-balanced squads in the country, passing and running between 49 and 51 percent of the time. Coaches pray for such balance. And the SMU defense, top 10 in key categories, will keep QB Jones and the Mean Green at bay.\nPick: SMU\n\nThis article, authored by Rob Miech, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-07 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":6}

Everything to Know About a Dark Moment in MLB History\n\nA decade ago, the Houston Astros were struggling to stay afloat. Parting ways with the National League after 50 years of play, the team was looking forward to an American League move. Hoping that their fortunes would be reversed from regularly ranking near the bottom of divisional standings, the Stros applied every method they could think of to win. But they weren\u2019t all above board.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nJim Crane had obtained club ownership on Nov. 17, 2011. That same year, he brought in Jeff Luhnow, former McKinsey & Company management consultant, as General Manager. In 2014, Crane brought in A.J. Hinch as the manager after the firing of Bo Porter. And there began the story of the rise and decline of one of baseball\u2019s biggest controversies.\nThe Story Behind the Cheating Scandal That Rocked the 2017 MLB Season\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nJeff Luhnow had always been more about the numbers than people. Wanting to take out the humanity factor from baseball, he was almost an outcast in the sport when Jim Crane hired him. But his radical approach had worked in St. Louis, giving them two championships in six years. Why not the Bayou City next?\nThe Houston Astros had not seen a World Series title yet and hadn\u2019t even made the playoffs since 2005. Apparently desperate for any measures, they resorted to cheating. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that Luhnow didn\u2019t consider his methods to be dishonest.\nAs it turned out, the Astros had stolen signs throughout the 2017 season and the beginning of 2018. But the hornet\u2019s nest wasn\u2019t broken open until next year, when The Athletic\u2018s Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich reported on it. After that, all hell broke loose.\nWhat Is Sign Stealing and How Did the Astros Manage to Do It?\nPowers of observation are as strong a skill as pitching or hitting and they\u2019re perfectly legal in baseball. A batter can sometimes figure out from a pitcher\u2019s unconscious movements, or \u2018tells\u2019, what kind of ball is coming their way. At any given moment, non-verbal signs are flying around between a dugout and the field as a way for the players to communicate with a manager or coach. But as long as it\u2019s done without extra help, this sign stealing is, in fact, allowed. What Houston did was not.\nThe Stros installed cameras in center field at Minute Maid Park to record the opposing team\u2019s catcher and pitcher\u2019s signs. Cameras in a ballpark are ideally for challenging calls, but what was one more purpose? The funny thing is, teams have tried to catch on to their rival team\u2019s signs since competitive baseball became a thing. The communication between the catcher and the pitcher can be key to hitting. But the 21st century has an added advantage \u2013 technology.\nBehind the scenes, players could see a live feed from the camera. Then-bench coach Alex Cora decided to get a screen installed in the dugout. Players or managers would watch the live feed on the television placed in the tunnel leading from the dugout to the clubhouse. The irony lay in the method they used to then really the information to whoever was up to bat on the plate.\nHaving tried out different methods of shouting and calling, the Astros landed on, of all things, a trash can. Players would bang on them, often using bats, with different rhythms signifying different pitches. Of course, they couldn\u2019t do it at each home game, nor did they try. But whatever sorcery Houston had been practicing that year, it did the trick. It worked like a charm, and the Astros had their first World Series trophy in a long history.\nHow Did MLB React to It? What Punishment Did It Hand Down?\nNot well. No one likes being taken for a fool and what the Astros had done undermined everything the league stood for. Fair play was the holy grail, yet the team had tread on it heartlessly. Fans were livid, although they didn\u2019t get to let out their frustration until 2021.\nMLB, for its part, tried to curb the situation as best as it could. In two months, the league investigated \u201c68 people, including 23 Astros players, and collect more than 76,000 emails,\u201d according to The Athletic. Luhnow\u2019s phone showed signs of deleted information. Jan. 13, 2020, was when MLB suspended the disgraced GM and the skipper for the 2020 season. Only for Jim Crane to fire both a few hours later. But for many, the solution was severely lacking.\nWhy Were the Astros Allowed to Keep Their World Series Trophy?\nIn the words of MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred, \u201cOnce you go down that road of changing what happens on the field, I just don\u2019t know how you decide where you stop.\u201d While many thought taking away the World Series win, essentially nullifying 2017, was the best way to move forward, MLB thought otherwise. The Coomissioner\u2019s Trophy was still legitimate in the eyes of, well, the Commissioner.\n\u201cCheaters\u201d Houston Astros Suddenly Gain Momentum as College Baseball Team Stirs Up Controversial Trash Can Past Along With Thousands\nBy the time the controversy was uncovered, the Astros were well into establishing a streak of successful years. Manfred called the process of stripping the Fall Classic title \u201cdifficult and impractical.\u201d Already unpopular among the masses, he made things worse for himself when he called the trophy a \u201cpiece of metal.\u201d Although he apologized later, the team kept the championship victory.\nWhy Were the Players Not Penalized?\nIt was an arduous process, investigating an entire organization. While the players were undoubtedly the ones who had put the tactics into play, the Astros staff suffered the heaviest consequences. The ballplayers were instead granted full immunity in exchange for cooperating with the investigation. Indeed, who would refuse such an offer?\nOf course, not everyone had been comfortable with what the Astros were doing behind the scenes, like Mike Fiers. Of that original team, four are still in Houston \u2013 Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman, Lance McCullers Jr., and Justin Verlander. What makes fans ponder their extreme methods is how genuinely skilled each is. Yet they participated, willingly or unwillingly, in the biggest baseball scandal in recent years.\nIs the Inquiry Still On?\nAfter the Jan. 13, 2020 declaration, not much came from Manfred. Other than suspending the front office, MLB fined the Astros $5 million, the maximum amount, and made them forfeit first and second-round draft picks. For better or for worse, the inquiry is over.\nHow Did the MLB World See This Entire Case?\nNeedless to say, cheating is never taken in a positive light. Players once accused of using PEDs face the consequences long after they have been retired. It\u2019s only been six years since 2017, and the league is still angry. Back then, social media was a landmine that the Astros probably stayed away from. It was the trash cans that did them in \u2013 the irony was too brilliant, or hilarious if one looks at it another way, to ignore.\nBoos and jabs at away games were the least of it. When the Astros went to play against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the team they had defeated in the 2017 World Series, fans retaliated by throwing inflatable trash cans onto the field. Others brought tin trash can caps to bang on when the Astros played against their teams. The phrase \u201cTake the trash out\u201d took a life of its own.\nFacing Cheating Allegations, Tom Brady\u2019s Successor Mockingly Asserts that He\u2019s not a Houston Astros Fan\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nBut it wasn\u2019t just baseball fans who were furious, other sports also considered it a tragedy. Fair play is taken seriously; no one likes being cheated out of an award. Even NBA star LeBron James spoke out in criticism against Houston.\nHas MLB Taken Any Action to Stop It From Happening Again?\nBefore the details of the scandal came out, MLB had handed out warnings here and there against sign stealing. After this fiasco, new restrictions in 2020 prevented the video replay from including the catcher\u2019s signs. In 2022, PitchCom devices also debuted. They allow a pitcher to communicate with the catcher without signs and a few other players on the field can also wear it. But will these tactics help?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nWATCH THIS STORY \u2013 Counting Down the Most Infamous Instances of Athletes Caught Cheating on Live Television\n2017 is still fresh in most fans\u2019 minds. The Astros are now in their seventh straight postseason and may make a repeat trip to the Fall Classic.

{"title":"Which M.L.B. Playoff Team Has the Most Daunting Home Field? We Ranked Them.","context":"## Which M.L.B. Playoff Team Has the Most Daunting Home Field? We Ranked Them.\n\nBy Chad Jennings, C. Trent Rosecrans and Stephen J. Nesbitt\nIn one American League Wild Card Series, the whole thing turned on a play designed around crowd noise. It was too loud at Target Field, Twins shortstop Carlos Correa realized, for the third-base coach to warn Blue Jays baserunners about a developing pickoff play. The Twins used the noise to their advantage, picked off Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and secured a two-game sweep.\nAdvertisement\nIn the other AL Wild Card Series, empty seats were everywhere. The Rays are an excellent team that thrives on their underdog status \u2014 low payroll, injured players, they always find a way \u2014 but playing in front of two of the smallest postseason crowds in the past 100 years, the Rays were swept by a Rangers team that had nine fewer wins in the regular season. The indifference was deafening.\nHome-field advantage, it turns out, just isn\u2019t the same from one ballpark to the next.\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I think we have one of the best home-field advantages in baseball,\u201d third baseman Alec Bohm said as the Phillies swept the Marlins to improve to 24-11 in postseason games at Citizens Bank Park. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s difficult to play here and things like that. I think going through that type of stuff and learning how to play here, that just makes this time of year that much better.\u201d\nThis time of year certainly brings out the best, and the postseason\u2019s greatest moments tend to be punctuated by the crowds who witness and react in real time. After seeing the way crowds could respond \u2014 or not \u2014 to October baseball this week, The Athletic ranked the home-field environments of the eight remaining playoff teams, from the replaceable to the Phanatical.\nNo. 8: Arizona Diamondbacks Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Diamondbacks Chase Field 1998 48,405 24,212\nMemorable postseason moment: Game 7 of the 2001 World Series started with a pair of 20-game winners in Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling and ended with Hall of Famers on the mound: Mariano Rivera and Randy Johnson. In what is remembered as one of the greatest postseason games of all time, Luis Gonzalez blooped a bases-loaded single to score Jay Bell and deny the Yankees their fourth consecutive title.\nOur take: We\u2019re sorry, D-Backs fans. It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s them. A tremendously impressive two-game sweep in Milwaukee carried the Diamondbacks into a division series showdown with, oh boy, the Dodgers. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t think Arizona can beat L.A. at home \u2014 the Diamondbacks split six games against the Dodgers at Chase Field this season \u2014 but it\u2019s less than a seven-hour drive from Dodger Stadium to downtown Phoenix, and we\u2019re concerned that all the quirks of that ballpark could be rendered meaningless if there\u2019s a bunch of Dodgers blue in the crowd.\nAdvertisement\nThere\u2019s a lot to like. The pool. The retractable roof. We love it. We hope you prove us wrong. Show up, go nuts, and leave a comment \u2014 click to subscribe! \u2014 telling us we don\u2019t know a rattlesnake from a water moccasin. We deserve it.\nBut if we had to go on the road for a playoff game, at least in this round, we\u2019d choose your ballpark. Consider it a compliment! Or maybe we just like the dry heat.\nNo. 7: Texas Rangers Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Rangers Globe Life Field 2020 40,300 31,272\nMemorable postseason moment: There have been 16 postseason games in Globe Life Field history, but the Rangers have never appeared in a playoff game at their new-ish home. How did that happen? Well, 2020. It was a weird time. The Dodgers played in all 16 of those during the 2020 expanded playoffs, sweeping the Padres in the NLDS, going seven games with the Braves in the NLCS and then winning the World Series.\nOur take: This is the great unknown. Globe Life Field opened in a season that had no fans, and it remained open for losing seasons in 2021 and 2022. Saturday will be our first look at the place when the home team is actually playing meaningful baseball in October. Hard to rank it any higher until we know what we\u2019re dealing with.\nLargest crowd ever for a game at Globe Life Field. #StraightUpTX pic.twitter.com\/4I7NIB5eF8 \u2014 Chris Halicke (@ChrisHalicke) May 1, 2022\nThe old Rangers ballpark could drum up a Texas-sized atmosphere worthy of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Pat Green, but the new place \u2014 at least in the regular season \u2014 feels very much like a multi-events space that happens to be hosting a ballgame. Maybe that changes in the playoffs? The Rangers haven\u2019t been home since Sept. 24 when they won their last five games in Arlington, the last three of which went a long way toward keeping the Mariners out of the postseason.\nWith a closed roof containing all the noise, Globe Life is sure to get awfully loud, and nothing turns a glorified convention center into a real ballpark quite like a late-inning rally in October.\nNo. 6: Minnesota Twins Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Twins Target Field 2010 38,544 24,371\nMemorable postseason moment: For this, you have to go all the way back to Tuesday. The Twins snapped an 18-game postseason losing streak with two blasts off the bat of rookie Royce Lewis. It was their first playoff win since Oct. 5, 2004. On Wednesday, they completed the Wild Card sweep of the Blue Jays for their first postseason series win since 2002. The roars heard at Target Field, like this one, were more than two decades in the making.\nOne of those 10,000 Rakes definitely belongs to Royce Lewis. \ud83d\udcaa pic.twitter.com\/3gRJp2i8eb \u2014 MLB (@MLB) October 3, 2023\nOur take: We have only a small sample of postseason games at Target Field, but, boy, Twins fans can make some noise. After Game 1 against Toronto, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said, \u201cI thought the place was going to split open and melt, honestly. It was out of this universe out there on the field. The fans took over the game. They helped us win today.\u201d The next day, they did it again.\nAdvertisement\nEarly in Game 2, Correa told Sonny Gray that, because of the crowd noise, Jays baserunners couldn\u2019t hear their third-base coach screaming, \u201cBACK!\u201d So, with Guerrero on second and a full count to Bo Bichette, they executed a perfect timing pick. \u201cThe crowd was incredible,\u201d Gray said after the game. \u201cThey were incredible yesterday. They were incredible today from the moment I stepped on the mound an hour before the game to the moment \u2014 they\u2019re probably still out there.\u201d\nSo, Twins fans have swarmed their team with support. But is it intimidating? (It\u2019s certainly better than its predecessor, the Metrodome, but it doesn\u2019t have the same potential for overwhelming volume.) For now, Target Field strikes us as more of an awesome place to play than one that strikes fear in the opponent. But this month Twins fans could prove us very wrong.\nNo. 5: Houston Astros Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Astros Minute Maid Park 2000 41,168 37,683\nMemorable postseason moment: Albert Pujols off Brad Lidge? Jorge Soler to the moon? Nah, we\u2019ll go with Chris Burke ending what was then the longest game in MLB postseason history in both time (5 hours, 50 minutes) and innings (18) with a walk-off home run with one out in the 18th inning in the 2005 NLDS. Burke didn\u2019t start the game but pinch-ran for Lance Berkman in the 10th. Roger Clemens came into the game for Houston in the 16th and pitched three scoreless to pick up the win. But it is Burke\u2019s homer that will always be remembered.\nOur take: We get it, Houston. We also think your ballpark should be in the top half of this list. One of our writers called it \u201cthe loudest stadium I\u2019ve ever attended, by at least one standard deviation.\u201d The Astros sold out the building 23 times this year. They drew 3 million fans for the first time since 2007. Minute Maid Park is big and loud, and visiting fans show up fully exhausted from walking in the south Texas sun.\nThe final out from the crowd\u2019s point of view. Wow. Congrats Astros!!! World Series champs again!! #fortheH pic.twitter.com\/HKnal8fcuB \u2014 Sally MacDonald (@SallyMacFox26) November 6, 2022\nBut in all those sellouts, the Astros went 6-17. Despite all that noise, they were 39-42 at home. Before their final homestand, the team added some green paint to the batter\u2019s eye in response to player complaints, and the Astros responded by going 1-5 with three of those losses coming against the Royals. So, yes, the ballpark is packed tighter than toes in a cowboy boot, and the place gets louder than a Pantera concert in a concrete basement, but these Astros just haven\u2019t responded to it. Why not? Should a visiting team really be all that intimidated by it? Bring back the in-play flagpole atop Tal\u2019s Hill, we say!\nNo. 4: Atlanta Braves Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Braves Truist Park 2017 41,084 39,401\nMemorable postseason moment: When the Braves won the World Series in 1914, they were still playing in Boston. In 1957, Milwaukee. When Sid Bream slid home to beat the Pirates in 1992, the Braves were in the right city but at the wrong ballpark (Fulton County Stadium doesn\u2019t count). The Max Fried-Jorge Soler game in 2021 happened in Houston. The iconic moment at Truist Park could be Eddie Rosario\u2019s dazzling catch at the wall in Game 4 of the 2021 World Series, but the most memorable \u2014 even though it didn\u2019t lead to a championship \u2014 might be rookie Ronald Acuna Jr. hitting a grand slam off Walker Buhler in Game 3 of the 2018 NLDS, which happened to be the first postseason game ever played at the ballpark.\nOur take: Obviously, there are issues bigger than baseball to deal with here. The war chant and Tomahawk Chop are offensive and problematic, but we\u2019re not going to resolve that issue in the next four weeks. In fact, it\u2019s all about to come front and center \u2014 again \u2014 as the best team in baseball opens its postseason with a roster that would be plenty intimidating in a Little League park with metal bleachers.\nAdvertisement\nBut have you ever seen them play in front of 40,000 screaming fans when the stadium lights go dark and the entire ballpark starts doing the Chop in unison with their lit cell phones?\n\u201cIt does add something to the offensive ambiance,\u201d our Braves scribe David O\u2019Brien noted.\nTruist Park had 54 sellouts this season, and the place drew just over 3.19 million, which was the Braves\u2019 highest total attendance since the park formerly known as SunTrust opened in 2017.\nThe Braves have won six straight division titles, and they\u2019ve been to the playoffs 22 times since 1991. This is not uncharted territory for them. This ballpark is going to be packed with fans who know their team is good and will not be quiet about it, regardless of what anyone else thinks.\nNo. 3: Baltimore Orioles Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Orioles Oriole Park at Camden Yards 1992 44,970 23,911\nMemorable postseason moment: Delmon Young\u2019s three-run double in the eighth inning of Game 2 of the 2014 ALDS completed the Orioles\u2019 comeback from three runs down in the eighth to beat the Tigers. Zack Britton pitched a perfect ninth, and the Orioles would go on to beat the Tigers in Game 3 in Detroit to sweep the series before losing to the Royals in the ALCS.\nOur take: When the Orioles are bad, their ballpark is bad. Beautiful and unmistakable, but bad because of the empty seats and because it is basically a second home ballpark for every East Coast team that takes the train into Baltimore and overwhelms the place with their own variation of the \u201cLet\u2019s go, Yankees\u201d chant. It\u2019s a ballpark that can be, and has been, taken over by opposing fans.\nWhen the Orioles are good, though, Camden Yards is one of the best ballparks in the country, and it starts pregame with every rendition of the national anthem that includes the entire ballpark screaming \u201cO!\u201d in unison, so loud that it drowns out the word \u201csay\u201d before the hope-they\u2019re-ready-for-it singer gets to the words, \u201cdoes that star-spangled banner yet wave.\u201d\nThe final night game of the 2023 regular season at Camden Yards pic.twitter.com\/ALgqhoJVp6 \u2014 Andy Kostka (@afkostka) September 30, 2023\nAs you\u2019ve no doubt realized, the Orioles are awfully good this year, and we expect Camden Yards to follow their lead. The O\u2019s had the second-most wins in baseball, and their fans responded with a home attendance that jumped more than a half million from last season. A young Orioles roster might be at risk of being shell-shocked on the road, but at home, this team is going to be treated as heroes from the start.\n\"Go crazy, Baltimore. You are the champions of the American League East.\" Kevin Brown on the call as the Orioles clinch the American League East and the No. 1 seed in the American League. pic.twitter.com\/Q2eXPe4uYL \u2014 Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) September 29, 2023\nLet\u2019s just hope, when they go on the road, manager Brandon Hyde doesn\u2019t forget to use his best reliever in a must-win game. That could be pretty bad.\nNo. 2: Los Angeles Dodgers Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Dodgers Dodger Stadium 1962 56,000 47,371\nMemorable postseason moment: With two outs and a runner on in the ninth inning of Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, Kirk Gibson hobbled toward home plate and stepped in against Hall of Fame A\u2019s closer Dennis Eckersley. The Dodgers were down one and down to their last out. Gibson had an injured left hamstring and a balky right knee. He fouled off Eckersley\u2019s first offering and almost fell over. He fouled off a couple more and worked the count full. Then he pulled an outside pitch into the right-field seats for a walk-off homer and, somehow, made his way around the bases. It remains one of the most badass moments in World Series history.\nOur take: All the jokes about traffic still making its way into the parking lot in the second inning are justified. The \u201cintensity\u201d of baseball in L.A. isn\u2019t the same as it is in, say, St. Louis or Boston or any other city where athletes are the biggest celebrities in town.\nAdvertisement\nBut by the middle innings, Dodger Stadium is packed, and by the late innings of playoff games, the place has the over-the-top intensity of a Michael Bay car chase (Mookie Betts as Bumblebee). More than one opposing pitcher this season had to tweak his PitchCom device to deal with the late-inning noise that came from such a massive ballpark, one that once again held the largest total attendance in baseball this year.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a four-deck stadium,\u201d Freddie Freeman said this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s the only one in baseball. You\u2019ve got 50,000 people, every single night here. For them to go out of their way to make you feel good when you\u2019re doing your job, it means a lot. I do appreciate it. It does make you feel good inside and also just means you\u2019re doing your job pretty good.\u201d\nSpeaking of doing a job pretty good, the Dodger Stadium D.J. is a maniac. For starters, the volume is set at a level that can\u2019t possibly meet OSHA standards, and beyond that, there\u2019s some twisted desire to have some sort of noise blaring at all times. Plus, there\u2019s the intimidation factor of playing in an iconic ballpark that feels like no other in baseball. Dodger Stadium knows what it is and what it\u2019s about, and it uses every bit of that to its advantage.\nNo. 1: Philadelphia Phillies Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Phillies Citizens Bank Park 2004 42,792 38,157\nMemorable postseason moment: There have been three no-hitters in postseason history, and two have taken place at Citizens Bank Park. Those in Philly would like to forget the Astros\u2019 combined no-hitter in Game 4 of last season\u2019s World Series, so instead we\u2019ll concentrate on Roy Halladay\u2019s 2010 no-hitter in Game 1 of the NLDS against the Reds. In his first postseason start, Halladay allowed only one baserunner, when Jay Bruce walked with two outs in the fifth inning.\nOur take: Look, Philadelphia fans have thrown snowballs at Santa Claus and batteries at J.D. Drew. Their Phanatic mascot is iconic, but part of his charm is the way he \u2013 it? \u2013 taunts and antagonizes opponents. It\u2019s a real love-it or hate-it place to play. The Phillies and their fans are capable of producing unforgettable moments, like Wednesday night when Bryson Stott hit a grand slam and the ballpark provided the only commentary necessary.\nstott grand slam w\/ no commentators thx to ESPN's dolby 5.1 mix pic.twitter.com\/2vhUzWKpup \u2014 jaiden (@steph_turkey) October 5, 2023\n\u201cI yelled at the dugout and couldn\u2019t really hear myself,\u201d Stott said, \u201cso I knew the crowd was loud. Any time we get to play here, you know it\u2019s going to be loud from the very first pitch. I wouldn\u2019t want to play anywhere else. It\u2019s a phenomenal time every time we take the field here in the postseason.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said it, we\u2019ve got the best fans in baseball,\u201d Bryce Harper added. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing place to play.\u201d\n(Top photo of Game 2 of the Wild Card series between the Marlins and the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park on Wednesday: Rob Tringali \/ MLB Photos via Getty Images)\n\nThis article, authored by The New York Times, was published by The New York Times on 2023-10-08 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":8}
{"title":"SBF Trial: The latest updates from the FTX collapse\u2019s courtroom drama","context":"## SBF Trial: The latest updates from the FTX collapse\u2019s courtroom drama\n\nSBF trial: Everything to know from the FTX courtroom ahead of his testimony Sam Bankman-Fried is in court for alleged fraud and money laundering while leading crypto exchange FTX and sister company Alameda. Here\u2019s our latest coverage as the case nears its end.\nThe trial of Bankman-Fried, the former CEO and co-founder of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, is entering its next chapter as proceedings resume Thursday. As confirmed during a teleconference Wednesday, SBF will be taking the stand, along with a handful of other witnesses as the onus shifts toward the defense after the prosecution brought its case to its conclusion.\nAs former federal prosecutor Josh Naftalis told TechCrunch, SBF taking to the stand in his own trial is a \u201cHail Mary\u201d ahead of a verdict and potential sentencing for seven counts tied to fraud and money laundering.\n\u201cOnce it goes to cross[-examination], he doesn\u2019t get to say, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019\u201d Naftalis said. \u201cHe can\u2019t just walk out if he doesn\u2019t like how it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nNaftalis spoke at length about what comes next in the trial, and addressed common misconceptions about the prosecution and defense in the latest episode of TechCrunch\u2019s Chain Reaction podcast, which you can listen to below, or on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.\nThe SBF trial is one of the biggest cases of its kind within the crypto space. Our resident crypto expert Jacquelyn Melinek has been on the ground at the trial since it started, and continues to cover the ins and outs of the proceedings. But the trial has been on pause from October 20 to today, so there\u2019s plenty to catch up on if you need a refresher ahead of it entering its final few phases.\nFor those in need of a total refresher on the case, her breakdown of how FTX went from the third-largest crypto exchange valued at a peak of $32 billion to bankruptcy will get you up to speed.\nYou can also follow along with her and the TechCrunch team\u2019s coverage in the Chain Reaction newsletter, which drops Thursdays at 12 p.m. PT, and the Chain Reaction podcast, which will hit your feed every Thursday.\nHow to follow the SBF trial\nThe trial kicked off with jury selection October 3. From there, access to the proceedings is limited, as no devices are allowed; reports are being physically put together within the courtroom (or sent to overflow rooms).\nBeyond our daily coverage, additional expertise and commentary will live on TechCrunch+. There, you can find stories like this in-depth breakdown of what to expect from both sides of the SBF case, where the prosecution and defense could gain ground or fall short in their arguments and what the takeaways were from the opening arguments.\nSBF trial: What we learned in week three\nThe third week of the trial featured a couple of noteworthy moments for the prosecution, including FTX\u2019s former general counsel Can Sun. He, like many of SBF\u2019s former colleagues, opted to cooperate with authorities and testified that SBF asked him to create a theoretical \u201clegal justification\u201d for the use of billions in consumer funds just days before FTX filed for bankruptcy.\nRobert Boroujerdi, managing director of the hedge fund Third Point, testified about his experience working with SBF and FTX, in a partnership that ultimately resulted in a $60 million investment and a lack of awareness about the special relationship between Alameda Research and FTX. Had he known of such a relationship, he testified that Third Point would not have invested in FTX in the first place.\nAnd earlier in the week, a University of Notre Dame professor who helped the government prosecution of Enron and WorldCom, Peter Easton, testified about what he uncovered after tracing the flow of billions of dollars between Alameda Research and FTX. Much of said funding came from customers, and Easton testified that he found that user deposits were used by both FTX and Alameda to purchase real estate, make investments or direct funding toward political causes and charities.\nSBF trial: What we learned in week two\nThe second week of the trial\u2019s standout testimony came from Alameda Research\u2019s former CEO Caroline Ellison, who claimed she took $14 billion from customers to repay debts to lenders, using them as a line of credit under the instruction of SBF. Ellison also went into detail about how a $2 billion venture fund, FTX Ventures, was funded by money that had previously been allocated to Alameda from third-party lenders.\nAnd though there are no charges of bribery in the case, Ellison also testified to paying Chinese officials $150 million to restore access to $1 billion in frozen trading accounts.\nSBF trial: What we learned in the week one\nAs expected, the opening statements in the SBF trial were spicy. The prosecution painted a picture of an empire \u201cbuilt on lies\u201d and made a point to show actual pictures of SBF alongside rich and powerful figures to illustrate the peak of his power and influence prior to FTX\u2019s implosion.\n\u201cThis man stole billions of dollars from thousands of people,\u201d prosecutor Thane Rehn told the court. \u201cHe defrauded sophisticated investors and lenders, and he emptied the accounts of ordinary customers, too. He bought himself wealth, power and influence.\u201d\nThe defense, on the other hand, depicted SBF and his colleagues as in over their heads, without ill-will as FTX collapsed around them.\n\u201cSam and his colleagues were building the plane as they were flying it,\u201d defense attorney Mark Cohen said. \u201cThey had to figure out how to navigate a world where they were running FTX, building out its systems, dealing with hacking threats, managing the credit risk of their customers, managing hundreds of employees, all while building up their actual exchange.\u201d\nRead a recap of the prosecution and defense\u2019s full arguments here.\nFTX\u2019s co-founder and CTO Gary Wang testified Thursday on the extent to which Alameda Research was used for whatever purposes he and SBF saw fit. The crypto trading firm, according to Wang, pulled funding directly from FTX customers, whose transactions would be funneled toward Alameda and then directed elsewhere.\nCheck here for our rundown of Wang\u2019s testimony so far, resulting from a guilty plea in December 2022.\nThursday also brought in testimony from Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner at crypto investment firm Paradigm. That firm invested $278 million in FTX across 2021 and 2022, and is part of a class-action lawsuit accusing it and others of defrauding customers by promoting FTX.\nHis testimony centered around being left uninformed about FTX\u2019s utilization of customer money to keep the Alameda Research afloat, a practice that Huang says would have halted his involvement. The full breakdown of his testimony on his relationship with FTX, stretching back to 2019, can be found right here.\nWe also got a look at the composition of the SBF trial\u2019s jury, which ranges from a train conductor to a retired investment banker who attended Stanford University. You can listen to a special joint episode of our podcasts Equity and Chain Reaction to get a better sense of the vibe between the jurors and the rest of the court.\nFor a full rundown of our coverage of the SBF trial, check below:\n\nThis article, authored by Morgan Little, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-06 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":9}
{"title":"SBF\u2019s trial starts soon, but how did he \u2014 and FTX \u2014 get here?","context":"## SBF\u2019s trial starts soon, but how did he \u2014 and FTX \u2014 get here?\n\nSBF\u2019s trial has started, this is how he and FTX got here\nThe highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started Tuesday to determine whether he\u2019s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. And as one former federal prosecutor put it: \u201cThe odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.\u201d\nThe 31-year-old co-founded FTX in 2019; within a few years the once third-largest crypto exchange\u2019s valuation hit $32 billion at its peak. It\u2019s now trying to claw back any funds to distribute to creditors.\nBut how did the once third-largest crypto exchange get here?\nBefore FTX, Bankman-Fried co-founded crypto-trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. He co-founded FTX in 2019 as a complement to Alameda, to help bring in revenue and liquidity for the trading arm.\nWithin two years, more than 80 investors provided about $2 billion in capital to FTX, helping Bankman-Fried propel his vision into a reality. In January 2022, the company raised $400 million in a Series C round, boosting its valuation to $32 billion. That was its last round of public funding.\nThe company gained somewhat mainstream recognition with branding deals and partnerships. For example, in 2021 it bought the naming rights for the Miami Heat\u2019s home arena. FTX also got its name branded on Major League Baseball umpires\u2019 polos, and it partnered with celebrities like Tom Brady and his ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, as well as Steph Curry, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Naomi Osaka, among others. He also had close ties to U.S. regulators and government officials, many of whom he donated to.\nBankman-Fried was even compared to Warren Buffet and many called him the white horse of crypto (TechCrunch never did, for what it\u2019s worth).\nBut in early November 2022, that all changed.\nFTX\u2019s collapse\nConcerns surrounding FTX\u2019s liquidity grew after CoinDesk published a copy of Alameda\u2019s balance sheet, showing the firm held $14.6 billion in assets and $8 billion in liabilities as of June 30, 2022.\nBut there was a problem: The report showed Alameda\u2019s largest asset was $3.66 billion of \u201cunlocked FTT\u201d and $2.16 billion of \u201cFTT collateral.\u201d FTT was the token behind FTX.\nThe balance sheet showed that the $5.82 billion in FTT tokens that Alameda owned was 193% higher than the total FTT market cap, which was about $3 billion at the time. That means it purported to have more FTT tokens on its balance sheet than what existed in the world.\nAround the same time it was exposed, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, started pulling out its remaining $2.1 billion equivalent of cash in BUSD and FTT. (It had an equity position in FTX from 2019 to 2021.) This essentially triggered a bank run on FTX.\nFTX and Alameda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. mid-November 2022. Bankman-Fried resigned, and John J. Ray III, the Enron turnaround veteran, was appointed its new CEO.\nBankman-Fried, however, maintained his innocence. At The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit, he appeared virtually from the Bahamas, saying \u201cI didn\u2019t ever try to commit fraud on anyone; I was shocked by what happened this month.\u201d In a published DM exchange with a Vox reporter, he said he regretted filing for bankruptcy and thought that \u201cregulators make everything worse.\u201d\nSBF arrested\nBankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 in the Bahamas, where FTX was based. He was then extradited to the U.S. to face a number of criminal charges. He was released on a $250 million bail bond, and he remained under house arrest at his parents\u2019 home in Palo Alto. This was revoked in August after he was accused of intimidating Alameda\u2019s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, by leaking her private diary.\nRay represented the company during a House Financial Services Committee hearing regarding FTX. When asked whether the firm had significant risk management systems, Ray said at the time that \u201cthere were virtually no internal controls and no separateness whatsoever\u201d and added that he did not \u201ctrust a single piece of paper\u201d in the exchange\u2019s organization. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged crimes \u201cone of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d in a press conference.\nThe aftermath\nFTX co-founder and former CTO Gary Wang, and Alameda Research\u2019s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, both pleaded guilty in December 2022 to federal criminal charges in relation to the FTX collapse. They\u2019re also facing civil penalties from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alongside the criminal charges. Wang and Ellison plan to cooperate with prosecutors and will be major witnesses in the trial, given their close ties to Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda.\nIn January, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all counts, which include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to misuse customer funds. He could face up to 115 years in jail if convicted on all charges.\nThe crypto industry as a whole suffered from FTX\u2019s collapse, which was the first of many. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022, as did Genesis Global Trading in January.\nWhere we are today\nBankman-Fried will be represented by Cohen & Gresser, and Mark Cohen, a high-profile defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, will be the lead attorney. If that name sounds familiar, it might be because he also represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex trafficking trial related to Jeffrey Epstein. He requested an early release for Bankman-Fried but was denied.\nWith the trial beginning, we\u2019re witnessing how FTX\u2019s story ends. But what\u2019s on our mind is what happens to the investors and creditors affected by the collapse? And what happens to the billions in crypto assets tied up in legal proceedings?\n\nThis article, authored by Jacquelyn Melinek, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-01 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":10}

It\u2019s TC\u2019s column that highlights the major stories over the past few days, and \u2014 we humbly submit \u2014 it\u2019s a darn useful resource for folks on the go.\nThis week, we cover Sam Altman backing a teen\u2019s AI startup, Google\u2019s hardware event (and first impressions of the Pixel 8 Pro), Flexport drama, and the ongoing FTX fallout. Also on the agenda: Gmail\u2019s harsher rules to prevent spam, TikTok testing an ad-free subscription plan, and LinkedIn going big on AI tools. And that\u2019s not all.\nIf you haven\u2019t, sign up here to get WiR in your inbox every Saturday. And if you have, our thanks. Now, let\u2019s get on with the news.\nMost read\nAltman backs teen entrepreneurs: Sam Altman is among the backers of an AI startup, founded by two teenagers, that\u2019s aiming to assist businesses in automating workflows in \u201cpreviously unexplored\u201d ways. Manish writes that Induced AI, founded this year, lets businesses input their back-office tasks in plain English and converts the instructions to pseudo-code in real time.\nGoogle unveils new hardware: This week was Google\u2019s annual hardware event, where the search and consumer tech giant showed off what it\u2019s been working on. Christine wrote up a thorough roundup of the news, which included updates on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, Android 14, Pixel Buds, Google Assistant, Bard, Pixel Watch 2 and other goodies.\nHands on with the Pixel 8 Pro: Darrell took the newly unveiled Pixel 8 Pro for a whirl, and he liked what he saw. While very similar to last year\u2019s model (the Pixel 7 Pro), Darrell felt that the improved cameras, brighter screen and enhanced AI-powered features made it enough of an upgrade to (potentially) warrant a purchase \u2014 minus the underutilized temperature sensor. Stay tuned for his full review.\nTurmoil at Flexport: Dave Clark, the former Amazon executive who was ousted as CEO of Flexport just a year into the job, fired back at its founder and board, calling recent reporting on the logistics company \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d Clark made the comments Monday in a lengthy post on social media site X following a report from CNBC that provided new information about his last days at Flexport, a freight forwarding and customs brokerage startup valued at $8 billion.\nSBF allegedly tried to buy off Trump: The TC team\u2019s been trained on the Manhattan Federal Court for the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced entrepreneur accused of orchestrating the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. But fascinating details about SBF\u2019s political dealings are emerging from a book by Michael Lewis, \u201cGoing Infinite,\u201d that debuted on the first day of the trial, like SBF\u2019s attempt to buy off Trump to get him to not run again for president.\nGmail fights back against spammers: Google this week announced a series of significant changes to how it handles email from bulk senders in an effort to cut down on spam and other unwanted emails. The company says that, starting next year, bulk senders will need to authenticate their emails, offer an easy way to unsubscribe and stay under a reported spam threshold.\nTikTok tests an ad-free tier: TikTok is testing an ad-free subscription tier for some users. For $4.99, subscribers get an ad-free experience on TikTok \u2014 no other strings attached. But don\u2019t look for the option to arrive anytime soon. TikTok says that it\u2019s piloting the plan in a single, English-speaking market outside the U.S. for now.\nLinkedIn leans into AI tools: LinkedIn this week unveiled a string of new AI features spanning its job hunting, marketing and sales products, Ingrid writes. They include a big update to its Recruiter talent sourcing platform, with AI assistance built into it throughout; an AI-powered LinkedIn Learning coach; and a new AI-powered tool for marketing campaigns.\nMusk comes clean about X\u2019s metrics \u2014 maybe: In September, Elon Musk said that X users were generating a lot of content \u2014 creating 100 million to 200 million posts every day, excluding retweets. But speaking at an event this week, X CEO Linda Yaccarino offered a contradictory figure. She claimed X was seeing 500 million posts per day on the platform. So who\u2019s right? Beats us.\nFormer NSA director\u2019s startup shutters: IronNet, a once-promising cybersecurity startup founded by a former NSA director, has shuttered and laid off its remaining staff following its collapse. The Virginia-based IronNet was founded in 2014 by retired four-star general Keith Alexander and had raised more than $400 million in funding. But IronNet failed to gain traction after going public in August 2021, and its stock price continued to steeply decline in the wake of an initial spike.\nAudio\nOn the hunt for a new podcast to listen to while you work out, do the dishes or rake the leaves (now that fall\u2019s arrived)? Look no further than TechCrunch\u2019s roster, which covers the world of startups, the blockchain and more.\nOn Equity this week, the crew talked about the SBF trial; deals from VR firms Rainforest, At One Ventures, Section 32 and Greylock, where venture funding has declined; and how Fearless Fund, a firm founded to invest in women of color, is being barred from awarding grants to Black women founders.\nMeanwhile, Found featured Esther Rodriguez-Villegas from Acurable, a medical device company that makes patient-friendly wearable devices to diagnose and manage respiratory conditions at home. As a career-long academic, Rodriguez-Villegas talks about how she never intended to be a founder until she learned about how the currently available medical devices make it extremely difficult to detect and treat diseases like sleep apnea and epilepsy.\nAnd over on Chain Reaction, Jacquelyn did a crossover episode with Alex about the SBF trial. Jacquelyn has been on the ground at the Southern District of New York courthouse, listening in to the trial in the same room as Bankman-Fried, so there was lots to talk about.\nTechCrunch+\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber.

We aren't defending good enough, we are leading 3-1 and we can't afford such mistakes because that makes the difference.\"\n4 Onana had another disappointing performance in goal for United Credit: Getty\n\"Every goal has it's own story,\" he added. \"The first is a transition moment, we spoke about quick release and we don't block the middle.\n\"The second is an unnecessary free-kick but then we have to defend the free-kick better. The third one we are very good and organised but we got run off and we are in an overload there.\n\"So, our mistakes can never happen in the Champions League, you get punished for it, so we have to learn from that.\"\nHowever, Aston Villa legend Gabby Agbonlahor insists Onana needs to take a significant chunk of the blame for United's collapse on Wednesday night.\n\"I feel sorry for Onana,\" Agbonlahor told talkSPORT. \"There's a clip of him throwing his gloves to the ground after the game. He's angry with himself.\n\"But those two free-kicks... you can't score those. They're easy saves and he's cost his team.\n\"If Onana doesn't make those two mistakes, I think United go on to win 4-1.\n\"He's so laid back on the ball that he can't switch on, he's late to dive for the free-kicks.\"\n4 United now face a huge task in their hope of reaching the last 16 Credit: AFP\nUnited's 12 goals in the group stage is the fifth highest tally out of any club but their defensive woes have been their downfall, and former defender Rio Ferdinand cites a lack of balance as to why.\nThe 2007\/08 Champions League winner with Man United said: \"I think they've got to look at themselves.\n\"You can't go into a Champions League campaign and score nine goals in three away games and have one point at the end of it. I think that shows you that there's a lack of balance in the team at the moment.\n\"Yes they can get goals and yes they are attacking at will and creating chances, many of them coming through Bruno. But I think defensively, they just made mistakes, I think the goalkeeper today has to hold his hands up and say, 'Yep, I was at fault for a couple of goals.\n\"He should do better. But, I think the manager will be scratching his head and thinking, 'The game plan first-half worked perfectly,' and then all of a sudden they score a goal, it changes the dynamic of the game.\n\"They were 2-0 up, 2-1, and you're thinking, 'Wow, I set the team up perfectly well, they execute it but then a mistake cost us,' and at 3-1, the same again.\n\"So I think there's a lot of question marks in the performances and the way they're going about things at the moment but balance for me is one of the key aspects that they've got to really find.\n\"We mentioned in commentary, scars from throwing away leads, those are hard to get away, you've got to really manage games and he mentioned that himself Bruno, you've got to go out managing games correctly.\n\"They've got to do that not over one or two or three games, they've got to do that over a period of games now so they can erase those scars that they've created and they'e grown through bad results and throwing away leads, especially in Europe.\"\n\nThis article, authored by Robert Calcutt, was published by TalkSport on 2023-11-29 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":12}
{"title":"Manchester United face Galatasaray with high hopes but bad memories","context":"## Manchester United face Galatasaray with high hopes but bad memories\n\nIt is 30 years since Manchester United\u2019s most famous trip to Istanbul with Champions League elimination on the line. Galatasaray created an unwelcome hell that Cerberus would have been proud of and a night of sin ended with Alex Ferguson\u2019s side being dumped out of Europe.\nUnited, realistically, required a win to progress after drawing 3\u20113 in the first leg of the second\u2011round tie at Old Trafford but the atmosphere in Turkey subdued the visitors and the second leg stuttered to a goalless draw. Eric Cantona was sent off late on for his frustrations with the referee and the home team\u2019s addiction to timewasting. There was a post-match melee in the tunnel involving the United squad and riot police as the trip ended like it began \u2013 with intimidation. Many of United\u2019s team froze, unable to deal with the ferocious and vociferous atmosphere they faced.\nThe match on Wednesday is not a knockout game but in truth the scenario is not much different. Defeat against Galatasaray would again end United\u2019s Champions League\u2019s campaign prematurely while a win, assuming Copenhagen lose against Bayern Munich, would put qualifying for the latter stages back in their hands. United will face the same atmosphere as they did 30 years ago because the home fans know victory would turn their subsequent trip to Denmark into a potential shootout for who goes through with Bayern, with the achievement of knocking out a club with the storied history of United only adding to the pleasure.\nIn 1993 everyone was on a learning curve at United. It was their first return to Europe\u2019s top table after an absence of 24 years. Much of the squad had won the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in 1990\u201191 but this was a clear step up. They defeated Honved before needing a late intervention from Cantona to avoid a deficit heading to Istanbul, where they were greeted at the airport by a horde of Galatasaray supporters providing a wall of noise and the infamous \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d banner.\n\u201cThat was our first foray in the Champions League and we were expected to go through,\u201d says the former United defender Gary Pallister, who was injured for the game and so had to watch proceedings from the stands. \u201cThe hostility is something [to learn from] \u2013 I never experienced anything like that in the rest of my career. You look at that and think it can\u2019t get any worse.\u201d\nThirty years on United head to Turkey knowing they have rarely been convincing in the Champions League in recent years. A 3-1 away win against Paris Saint-Germain in the 2018-19 round of 16 after losing the home leg 2-0 was the last time they won a crunch match. In 2020\u201121, they lost their final two group games and were eliminated, while back in 2015-16, Wolfsburg won the deciding group match to knock out United.\nMauro Icardi celebrates scoring the winner for Galatasaray in their 3-2 win at Old Trafford in early October. Photograph: Darren Staples\/AFP\/Getty Images\nWhen it comes to pressure in the Champions League of late, United do not cope well and there are few events trickier than a night in Istanbul. Pallister smiled at a bell boy at the team hotel and got a finger across the throat in response, Brian McClair had a cleaner bang on his bedroom ceiling in the night and other players received numerous phone calls to disrupt their sleep. The current squad could face the same level of malevolence and need to be prepared.\nUnited have done little learning in recent times, repeating the same failures in Europe\u2019s elite competition. It would not be a disgrace to lose against a good Galatasaray team, especially given Erik ten Hag is missing key players, but if the worst does happen, everyone will need to come out of the experience stronger. Regardless of the result, it should be a night of education when it comes to the demands of the Champions League.\nSix of United\u2019s squad that failed in 1993 went on to win the competition six years later. \u201cIt did galvanise us,\u201d says Mike Phelan, who started in central midfield 30 years ago. \u201cWinning the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup took us to another level and we felt pretty comfortable with each other and felt we could develop into a serious team, and I think going into the Champions League was one of those moments where we expected to do well \u2013 the experiences along the way were great and took us to the next level further down the line.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Garnacho scored with an incredible overhead kick and Mainoo impressed on what was his full Premier League debut, which could earn him a start in Turkey and an education in European football.\nAround them are players who have succeeded on hostile nights. But if they thought Goodison Park was unwelcoming, they will be in for a surprise on Wednesday and will need to find communal coping mechanisms.

Cue squinted down at the screen.\n\u201cThe resolution on this is terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should get a Mac.\u201d That got some laughs in an otherwise staid and quiet courtroom. Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over the case, leaned into his microphone and responded, \u201cIf Apple would like to make a donation\u2026\u201d That got even bigger laughs. Then everybody got back down to business.\nCue was on the stand as a witness in US v. Google, the landmark antitrust trial over Google\u2019s search business. Cue is one of the highest-profile witnesses in the case so far, in part because the deal between Google and Apple \u2014 which makes Google the default search engine on all Apple devices and pays Apple billions of dollars a year \u2014 is central to the US Department of Justice\u2019s case against Google.\nCue had two messages: Apple believes in protecting its users\u2019 privacy, and it also believes in Google. Whether those two statements can be simultaneously true became the question of the day.\nApple is in court because of something called the Information Services Agreement, or ISA: a deal that makes Google\u2019s search engine the default on Apple\u2019s products. The ISA has been in place since 2002, but Cue was responsible for negotiating its current iteration with Google CEO Sundar Pichai in 2016. In testimony today, the Justice Department grilled Cue about the specifics of the deal.\nWhen the two sides renegotiated, Cue said on the stand, Apple wanted a higher percentage of the revenue Google made from Apple users it directed toward the search engine. Discussion of specific numbers was reserved for closed court sessions, but Cue wanted Apple to get a higher percentage, while Pichai wanted to keep the deal as it was. They eventually compromised on some other number we weren\u2019t told in court, and Google has been paying Apple that amount since.\n\u201cI always felt like it was in Google\u2019s best interest, and our best interest, to get a deal done.\u201d\nMeagan Bellshaw, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Cue if he would have walked away from the deal if the two sides couldn\u2019t agree on a revenue-share figure. Cue said he\u2019d never really considered that an option: \u201cI always felt like it was in Google\u2019s best interest, and our best interest, to get a deal done.\u201d Cue also argued that the deal was about more than economics and that Apple never seriously considered switching to another provider or building its own search product. \u201cCertainly there wasn\u2019t a valid alternative to Google at the time,\u201d Cue said. He said there still isn\u2019t one.\nThat question \u2014 whether Apple picked Google because it\u2019s the most lucrative choice or the best product \u2014 was a key part of Cue\u2019s testimony and, in fact, a key part of the DOJ\u2019s entire case against Google. The Justice Department is focused on the deals Google makes \u2014 with Apple but also with Samsung and Mozilla and many others \u2014 to ensure it is the default search engine on practically every platform.\nBellshaw asked Cue a number of questions about the iPhone setup process. Those three screenshots showed the Appearance screen that shows up when you first boot up your iPhone so you can pick font sizes; the location-tracking prompt that appears when you open Maps; and the App Tracking Transparency pop-up that tells you when an app wants to collect your data. Cue objected to all these things being considered part of setup, but Bellshaw\u2019s point was that Apple offers its users a choice about lots of things, big and small, and that search could be one of them.\n\u201cWe try to get people up and running as fast as possible.\u201d\nCue acknowledged that the ISA didn\u2019t allow Apple to offer users a choice of search engines during setup but also said he wouldn\u2019t want to do that anyway. \u201cWe try to get people up and running as fast as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cSetup is just critical stuff.\u201d Showing people a bunch of search engines they\u2019ve never heard of would just be a bad user experience, he argued; even Cue couldn\u2019t remember the names of some of the alternatives to Google. \u201cWe make Google be the default search engine,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve always thought it was the best. We pick the best one and let users easily change it.\u201d (\u201cEasily\u201d is a persistent point of contention in this trial \u2014 DuckDuckGo\u2019s CEO, who testified last week, claimed it takes \u201ctoo many steps\u201d to switch.)\nAs for the privacy pop-ups? This is where Bellshaw began to press on how exactly Apple decided Google had the best product. She asked Cue if Apple believes user privacy is important, to which he said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Then, she showed a series of emails and slides in which Cue and Apple railed against Google\u2019s privacy policies. Cue readily agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve always thought we had better privacy than Google,\u201d he told Bellshaw. He said that one provision of the ISA with Google was that Google had to allow people to search without logging in and that Apple has done things in Safari and around its platforms to make it harder for Google or anyone else to track users.\nBellshaw never quite said it, but the DOJ\u2019s implication seemed to be that, essentially, Google is a privacy menace anathema to everything Apple believes is important to its users, but Apple gives it a central place in its platform because Google pays it so handsomely. Bellshaw asked Cue to review some of Apple\u2019s financial filings. Isn\u2019t it true that the ISA represents a significant portion of Apple\u2019s profits, she asked? Cue said that\u2019s not how Apple looks at it because it doesn\u2019t account for all the work Apple did to make its platform so appealing that an agreement like this could work as well as it does.\nLater, after a closed session in the courtroom and a break for lunch, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein led Cue through a history of the Google \/ Apple partnership, and a history of the Safari browser. Cue noted that Safari\u2019s combination of URL and search bar was a user interface innovation, and the seamless Google integration was part of what made it work. In early promotional materials for Safari, Schmidtlein pointed out, the Google integration was nearly always mentioned.\n\u201cBefore 2003,\u201d Cue said, \u201cthe way that you searched the web was you had to go in and you had to type in google.com in the URL field, or you could type in another URL. We came up with the idea that if you type anything in the URL field that\u2019s not a URL, it just goes to search.\u201d\nSchmidtlein\u2019s overall point was that Google helped Safari succeed not by forcing Apple\u2019s hand, but by being a great product that integrated seamlessly with Apple\u2019s own stuff. He referenced Apple\u2019s deals with Yahoo and Bing that make those services easy to find, and both men argued that switching search engines is so easy as to be a non-issue. Bellshaw briefly stepped up to rebut that notion, and that was it for Cue\u2019s testimony.\nAt least, that\u2019s all the testimony we saw. Like so many things in this trial, the star witness was kept mostly under wraps thanks to complaints and worries about revealing confidential numbers and corporate secrets. But the questions put to Cue were the same ones the DOJ is going to keep asking: is Google really the best search engine, or is it just the one writing the biggest checks? And if those checks went away, what would the search engine market look like? Cue said Apple\u2019s never really thought about it. Google said Apple would be silly to do so. And the Justice Department thinks it\u2019s about time Apple starts doing so.\n\nThis article, authored by David Pierce, was published by The Verge on 2023-09-26 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":14}
{"title":"More from the US v Google trial: vertical search, pre-installs and the case of Firefox\/Yahoo","context":"## More from the US v Google trial: vertical search, pre-installs and the case of Firefox\/Yahoo\n\nMore from the US v Google trial: Vertical search, pre-installs and the case of Firefox\/Yahoo\nWe\u2019re nearly two months into the Justice Department\u2019s landmark antitrust case against Google \u2014 one of the biggest fights in tech antitrust since the U.S. took Microsoft to trial in the 1990s \u2014 and the revelations just keep getting juicier.\nIn our last roundup, we learned how Google spent $26.3 billion in 2021 making itself the default search engine across platforms and how Google tried to have Chrome preinstalled on iPhones. Over the past couple of weeks, more of the inner workings of Google has come to light, including some of the search engine\u2019s most lucrative search queries, what the revenue-share agreements between Google and Android OEMs look like and why Expedia has a bone to pick with Google.\nBefore we go into some of these tidbits\u2026\nWhy the Google vs. U.S. antitrust case matters\nThe government has argued that Google uses its platforms and deals with partners to block out any competition in search or advertising, thus hindering competitors from accessing the data they\u2019d need to improve their products. If Judge Amit Mehta rules against Google, the search giant may have to change its behavior and share its APIs with third-party developers. It may also be banned from making anticompetitive and exclusive deals with smartphone and computer manufacturers and wireless carriers. Google might end up having to turn over all or most of the data it has collected to other search engines so they can improve their products and attract more users. The DOJ has said that Google gets 16 times more data than Bing does everyday. Enforcers want to show that antitrust law remains relevant and that even though Google is basically the God of the internet, it\u2019s still no match for the U.S. law. The Google outcome could also have a ripple effect on other Big Tech cases. The FTC sued Amazon in September for using anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power. The DOJ has been investigating Apple for years over the company\u2019s policy for third-party apps on its devices and whether it unfairly favors its own products. There\u2019s an ongoing case between the FTC and Facebook, wherein the agency calls on Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.\nThis isn\u2019t Google\u2019s only antitrust case in trial right now. The search engine giant last week settled a separate antitrust lawsuit with dating site Match Group. On November 6, Google went to trial with Fortnite maker Epic Games. The latter hopes to prove that Google engages in anticompetitive behavior with regard to its Android app store, Google Play, and its commission structure.\nNow, onto the roundup!\nA window into Google\u2019s most popular search queries\nJudge Amit Mehta ruled to make a list public that provides a glimpse of which search terms make Google the most money. The list of popular search terms ordered by revenue includes 20 terms that were lucrative for the week of September 22, 2018. Information like revenue per search term, how many queries each of those terms got, along with a separate list of popular search terms ordered by queries (not revenue), were all redacted. The list we can see is as follows:\niPhone 8\niPhone 8 plus\nAuto insurance\nCar insurance\nCheap flights\nCar insurance quotes\nDirecTV\nOnline colleges\nAT&T\nHulu\niPhone\nUber\nSpectrum\nComcast\nXfinity\nInsurance quotes\nFree credit report\nCheap car insurance\nAARP\nLifeLock\nThere is, in reality, little surprise here. We\u2019ve already established that Google and Apple have a long and mutually beneficial relationship, even while competing, so it\u2019s not surprising to see three Apple search-related queries bringing in the big bucks \u2014 not least since September 22, 2017 was the official release date of the iPhone 8.\nMeanwhile, queries like \u201ccar insurance,\u201d \u201ccheap flights\u201d and \u201ccredit report\u201d are perennial favorites and they speak to how much Google dominates vertical search \u2014 that is, search in very specific market categories. As for LifeLock\u2026 the big Equifax data breach of 2017 was a hot topic in September 2017 and LifeLock was making a big push to win business with people who wanted to buy identity theft protection.\nRevenue-shares to pre-install Google apps on Androids\nJamie Rosenberg, a Google employee who focuses on Android and Google Play, testified in Google\u2019s defense on November 8. He said that the competition between Google and Apple is \u201cas intense as it gets,\u201d reports Bloomberg.\nRosenberg explained how Google gets manufacturers to sign a mobile app distribution agreement (MADA) that requires Android smartphone makers (like Samsung or Oppo) to pre-load a bundle of 11 Google apps on the device, including Search, Chrome and Play. They don\u2019t have to be the default choices, he said.\nGoogle also has revenue share agreements (RSAs) with smartphone makers and wireless carriers (like Verizon) that require them to set Google search and Chrome web browser as defaults. Rosenberg defended the move and said it was because Google apps [like Search] are \u201cbest in class.\u201d The RSAs also motivate other companies to make or sell more Android devices, he said.\nExpedia complains of too many ads on search, expensive ad payments\nOn November 1, Barry Diller, chair of Expedia and IAC, testified about his concerns regarding the increasing number of ads in search results having an impact on organic listings.\n\u201cI must say I\u2019m on the edge of revolt now that Google\u2019s actions are so punitive, not just for Expedia but also for IAC and all the players that depend upon something of a level playing field,\u201d wrote Diller in a letter to Google back in 2019, according to Bloomberg.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai fired back that Google\u2019s travel listings was one of the most popular experiences the company built.\nExpedia execs also testified about the cost of ads and how increases had no impact on search results. On October 19, Expedia\u2019s former chief operating officer, Jeff Hurst, told the court the company\u2019s ad fees increased tenfold from $21 million in 2015 to $290 million in 2019. And yet, Expedia\u2019s traffic from Google did not increase. The implication was that this was due to direct competition from Google itself. Hurst pointed out that Google began sharing its own flight and hotel data in search results in that period, according to The Seattle Times.\nEuropean antitrust fine spurs Google to beef up search engine quality\nThe government argued on November 10 that Google only endeavored to enhance its search engine in the European Union after it was hit by a \u20ac5 billion antitrust fine in 2018, internal documents revealed, according to Bloomberg.\nThe EU\u2019s antitrust order forced Google to offer Android phone users a screen with five search engine options to choose from, according to the DOJ. In response, Google enacted a plan, which execs dubbed \u201cGo Big in Europe,\u201d to enhance search results in France and Germany in 2019 and 2020 with more local content: news, post-game soccer video highlights, information on local television options for streaming, and pronunciation practice for different language. The aim was to incentivize users to click on Google\u2019s home screen, rather than the competition\u2019s.\nThat revelation effectively supports the Justice Department\u2019s argument that Google, without the push of competition, has little incentive to improve its products, a classic consequence in a monopoly.\nMozilla digs in on Google\u2019s supremacy in search\nInterestingly, on November 1 Mozilla CEO Mitchell Baker provided a defense of Google\u2019s quality as a search engine, even in \u201ccompetitive\u201d environments. Specifically, Baker recounted how, Mozilla \u201cfailed\u201d when it switched Firefox\u2019s default search engine from Google to Yahoo.\nQuick backstory: Yahoo inked a deal with Mozilla way back in 2014 to pay the browser maker $375 million annually to be the default search engine on Firefox. At the time, Google was offering $276 million, said Baker. Reader, that was a bad deal.\n\u201cI felt strongly that Yahoo was not delivering the search experience we needed and had contracted for,\u201d she said, according to Bloomberg. The executive said Yahoo had promised to reduce the number of ads and offer less user tracking, but ended up gradually serving users more ads anyway.\n\u201cThe number of users who stayed with Firefox declined noticeably during the years when Yahoo was the default,\u201d said Baker.\nBaker, who was providing a recorded deposition for Google\u2019s defense, noted that Mozilla\u2019s users apparently wanted and expected Google.\nHowever, that is not the full story. Yahoo was already well behind Google in terms of search technology at that point. But also, Firefox was very well behind Chrome, which ended 2014 with nearly 50% market share and ended 2017 (when Google got prime default search position on Firefox) at nearly 65% of all web browser usage on desktop: and mobile is even more skewed to Chrome. In other words, the number of Firefox users might have been declining for other reasons, although pushing the blame on Yahoo certainly works in Google\u2019s favor here!\nThe trial continues\u2026\n\nThis article, authored by Rebecca Bellan, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-13 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":15}
{"title":"How to choose the best class for you in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3","context":"## How to choose the best class for you in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\n\nPicking the best class in Baldurs Gate 3 is one of the most important decisions you\u2019ll make in the game \u2014 and you have to do it right at the start, with minimal context to work off.\nYour class mostly determines how your character will fight in Baldur\u2019s Gate, but with 12 classes \u2014 and 46 subclasses total across them all \u2014 it\u2019s not really an easy decision. Here\u2019s what to know about finding the best class (and the best subclass) for you in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3.\nAll BG3 classes are \u2018good\u2019\nThe classes in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 \u2014 and in pen-and-paper D&D, for that matter \u2014 are all fairly well-balanced. There\u2019s no single best class (barrelmancer aside) in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, and the game gives you as many opportunities for creative problem solving as it does for punching. Finding the best class really just boils down to how you want to play. Even when playing solo, you\u2019ll still manage the rest of your party, so you\u2019ll get to experiment with multiple classes at once.\nBG3 classes have strengths outside of combat\nYour character\u2019s class is mostly about combat, but the underlying Ability Score that it relies on affects the other skills you\u2019ll use to interact with the world. Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 assigns your Ability Scores automatically (though you can tweak it in the character creator), so each class\u2019s primary ability will be your highest score.\nBards and Sorcerers are both Charisma-based classes, for example. Their high Charisma will also make them good at skills like Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation. Out of combat, those classes will be better at talking their way out of (and into) trouble and lying. Wisdom-based classes like Clerics or Druids will be more insightful and perceptive of their surroundings.\nShould you play a custom or an Origin character in BG3?\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 gives you the option to play as an Origin character, meaning you can just choose one of the NPCs from your party and play as them right out of the gate. It\u2019s a perfectly fine way to play if you really don\u2019t want to go through the process of picking out a race and background for your character.\nThat said, you\u2019ll also be limited to that character\u2019s predetermined story. It\u2019s a bit more work at the beginning, but you\u2019ll have a lot more freedom to experience the entire story of Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 if you make a custom character. With all that in mind...\nWhich BG3 class (and subclass) is best for you?\nDistinctions like caster vs. puncher or melee vs. ranged don\u2019t really work for Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 (or D&D). There\u2019s a lot of overlap in the classes \u2014 especially as you level up. And that means there\u2019s no easy way to say one class is best (or even better). Instead, focus on what you want to do (or how you want to do it), and go from there.\nWe\u2019ll list them all below ranked (subjectively) by how difficult they are to play. We\u2019ve put the caster classes toward the more difficult end simply because they\u2019ve got more to manage with their spells and spell slots \u2014 punching things is easier than memorizing spells.\nBest melee class for beginners: Fighter\nNothing against Fighters here, but they\u2019re the easiest class to wrap your head around. You\u2019re not going to need to manage spells or Ki Points. Instead, you\u2019ll see a baddie and then you\u2019ll stab said baddie.\nFighters start out as a very straightforward melee class. With high strength, they get all armors and shields, and choose a method of combat to focus on (and get buffs to). They also get a way to heal themselves and way to get a second attack once per short rest.\nAt level 3, you get to choose a subclass from Battle Master, Eldritch Knight, and Champion. Battlemasters get a set of Superiority Dice that let you perform Maneuvers to control the flow of battle and the battlefield. Eldritch Knights add magic into the Fighter\u2019s arsenal. Champions keep it simple with a better change to deal a Critical Hit (for double damage).\nChampion is the best subclass for a Fighter. Consult our Fighter build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest ranged class for beginners: Ranger\nRangers are agile hunters that focus on Dexterity as their primary Ability. Rangers are an interesting mix of melee, stealth, skills, and magic. That also makes it harder to get the most out of the class. Rangers get Light and Medium Armors and some of the more basic weapons.\nRangers also make a lot of choices during character creation (and leveling up) that determine how they play. At level 1, you\u2019ll choose a Favored Enemy \u2014 a preferred quarry \u2014 and a preferred environment that grants you some magical spells.\nAt level 3, you get to choose a Ranger subclass from Beast Master, Gloom Stalker, or Hunter. Beast Masters get a Companion animal that fights along side you, Gloom Stalkers focus on stealth, and Hunters get to specialize their melee abilities.\nHunter is the best subclass for a Ranger. Consult our Ranger build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest class for damage: Barbarian\nBarbarians are all about combat. They get light and medium armor (and shields), but they\u2019ve also got the option to keep their AC up even without wearing armor. For weapons, Barbarians get a wide range of heavy hitters like battleaxes and warhammers. Every Barbarian gets the Rage ability that lets them hit even harder and reduce damage during combat (and only during combat).\nWhen you hit level 3, you get to choose from the Wildheart, Berserker, or Wild Magic subclasses. Wildheart lets you modify your Rage ability with animal-themed tweaks like healing, jumping, or a stampede. Berserker is a lot more straightforward and focuses on hitting (extra) things and throwing. And Wild Magic adds a magical flair to your Rage with a random magical effect and improved saving throws against magic for you and your allies.\nBerserker is the best subclass for a Barbarian. Consult our Barbarian build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest class for magic: Druid\nDruids are the nature-based casters of Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. Most of their magic is nature- or animal-themed and they get Skills to match. What they lack in armor proficiencies \u2014 they only get Light and Medium Armor \u2014 they make up for with the ability to shapeshift into a badger, wolf, spider, or cat.\nAt level 3, Druids pick from the Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, and Circle of Spores subclasses. Circle of Land gets you some extra magic and the ability to cast more spells throughout the day, Circle of the Moon adds a bear to the repertoire of animal shapes you can shift into, and Circle of Spores adds in some extra fungus- and decay-based magic.\nCircle of the Moon is the best subclass for a Druid. Consult our Druid build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest class for stealth: Rogue\nRogues are Dexterity-based, sneaky fighters. They only get Light Armor, so they have to focus on staying unseen and quick. Their weapons tend to be simple and focus on ones that have the Finesse type \u2014 meaning you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength. All Rogues get to use Dash (double movement), Disengage (don\u2019t provoke Opportunity Attacks), and Hide as Bonus Actions. They also get Sneak Attack combat actions that let them deal extra damage whenever they have Advantage.\nLevel 3 Rogues choose from the Thief, Arcane Trickster, and Assassin subclasses. Thief Rogues get an extra bonus action, Arcane Tricksters mix in magic, and Assassins get advantages over surprised or unprepared enemies.\nThief is the best subclass for a Rogue. Consult our Rogue build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest class for melee and magic: Paladin\nPaladins start out mixing in (Divine) magic with their melee abilities. They\u2019re the most magic-focused of the melee classes. They get all armors and shields, along with a good mix of weapons. Choosing from the three subclasses \u2014 Oath of the Ancients, Oath of Devotion, and Oath of Vengeance \u2014 determines what kind of magic you get. Oath of the Ancients adds in healing magic, Oath of Devotion gets defense-focused magic, and Oath of Vengeance adds offensive magic. Paladins also get a handful of other spells for dealing out even more holy justice.\nOath of the Ancients is the best subclass for a Paladin. Consult our Paladin build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest class for speed: Monk\nMonks are a melee class kind of like Fighters, but with a lot more pizzazz. Their best Ability is Dexterity, so their combat is more martial arts than swordplay. Monks don't get armor and only have a limited set of weapons available, but they make up for it with Unarmed Strikes that deal extra damage. Monks take a little more finesse to play than Fighters.\nMonk subclasses unlock at level 3 and include Way of the Four Elements, Way of the Open Hand, and Way of Shadow. Way of the Four Elements mixes in spells with your Monk abilities (and uses renamed spells from the caster classes). Way of the Open Hand expands your attacks to include things like knocking down enemies or pushing them with extra melee attacks. And Way of Shadow makes your Monk sneaky and stealthy (think of it as a ninja subclass).\nWay of the Open Palm is the best subclass for a Monk. Consult our Monk build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest magic class for beginners: Warlock\nWarlocks are casters that made a deal with a higher power for their magic. They play a lot like Sorcerers, but with a slight emphasis on more academic Skills and fewer spells. Warlocks get Light Armor, so they\u2019re a little less squishy than Sorcerers.\nLike Sorcerers, you\u2019ll pick your Warlock subclass during character creation. You\u2019ll choose from The Fiend, The Great Old One, and The Archfey subclasses that are all themed around where your magic comes from \u2014 and determine some of the spells you can use. The Fiend Warlocks get their magic from a demon-like fiend and have hell-themed spells, the Great Old One is more Lovecraftian horror-themed, and the Archfey draws power from a powerful Fey being.\nGreat Old One is the best subclass for a Sorcerer. Consult our Sorcerer build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest healer class: Cleric\nClerics are the other side of the Paladin\u2019s mix of magic and melee. They\u2019re not quite as frontline in combat with only Light and Medium armors, but they get more (and more powerful) spells. Clerics also get an extra boost with Channel Divinity that gets them an extra (Divine) magic ability like Turning Undead to drive away zombies or Guided Strike that gives a +10 to Attack Rolls.\nWhen you make a Cleric, you choose a subclass (Domain) from a list of seven: Life, Light, Trickery, Knowledge, Nature, Tempest, and War. Each Domain has different spells, actions, and even proficiencies associated with hit. Broadly, Life Domain focuses on healing, Light emphasizes Radiant and Fire magic (in and out of combat), Trickery is good for sneaking, Knowledge gets extra Skills out of combat and brain-based spells, Nature is flavored a little more like a Druid, Tempest is a little more combat and Thunder damage-focused, and War is all about combat.\nLight Domain is the best subclass for a Cleric. Consult our Cleric build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest support class: Bard\nBards are a specialized kind of caster class that focus more on performance and charm than a weighty list of spells. Bards only get Light Armor and focus on Charisma as their primary stat, so they rarely belong on the front line of a fight. Where Bards come into their own, though, is with Bardic Inspiration \u2014 a way to boost the rolls of their allies \u2014 and their spells that are a nice mix of utility and offensive magic.\nBards get three subclasses at level 3: College of Lore, College of Valor, and College of Swords. College of Lore Bards get a lot of useful skills to use outside of combat and get to use their Bardic Inspiration to make enemies weaker, College of Valor Bards help their allies hit even harder, and College of Swords Bards focus on a swashbuckling style of combat.\nCollege of Valor is the best subclass for a Bard. Consult our Bard build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest class for magic damage: Wizard\nWizards are the archetypical caster class. They are the only Intelligence-based class in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 and have the most spells \u2014 and the most spell slots to cast them \u2014 of all of the casters. Wizards don\u2019t get any armor and are limited to just daggers and quarterstaffs (quarterstaves?) in combat, so they\u2019re going to rely on magic to do any damage.\nYour Wizard subclass is chosen when you create the character. You\u2019ll choose from eight schools of magic: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. Each subclass gets an extra ability themed to the school of magic. Broadly speaking, Abjuration is about protection and defense, Conjuration is about creating something from nothing, Divination gets to foresee (and change) rolls, Enchantment is about charming and controlling minds, Evocation shapes and controls spells, Illusion is about trickery, Necromancy controls life and death, and Transmutation focuses on alchemy and changing the world around you.\nEvocation is the best subclass for a Wizard. Consult our Wizard build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nBest class for social interactions: Sorcerer\nSorcerers get their magic from within themselves. Sorcerers are the most flexible and varied in the spells they can use. Their primary Ability is Charisma, so they\u2019re also good at dialogue-heavy encounters out of combat. Sorcerers don\u2019t get any armor, so you\u2019ll have to keep them out of melee combat most of the time.\nYou\u2019ll pick your Sorcerer subclass when you create your character from the Wild Magic, Draconic Bloodline, and Storm Sorcery subclasses. Wild Magic leans into the chaotic and untamed nature of magic, Draconic Bloodline gives a dragon-based flavor to your magic, and Storm Sorcery lets you Fly whenever you cast a spell.\nDraconic Bloodline is the best subclass for a Sorcerer. Consult our Sorcerer build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.\nFor more information on the classes in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, consult our overviews on the Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard classes.\n\nThis article, authored by Jeffrey Parkin, was published by Polygon on 2023-12-18 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":16}

Warlocks are extreme knowledge-seekers who are willing to form a pact with otherwordly beings in order to gain ancient secrets that\u2019ll bolster their magical arsenal.\nTo deal with such powerful creatures, Warlocks need to have strong mental power. They need to be able to make a deal with the devil and survive. As such, their primary ability score is Charisma.\nThere\u2019s no single best class in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, and the game gives you as many opportunities for creative problem solving as it does for punching.

During character creation, you must pick the otherworldy patron that you\u2019ve decided to serve.\nThe Fiend\nWarlocks with The Fiend subclass have struck a deal with a hellish fiend who strives for corruption and destruction. If you forge a pact with a fiend, you\u2019ll receive a feature exclusive to The Fiend called \u201cDark One\u2019s Blessing,\u201d which will grant you four temporary hit points whenever you defeat a hostile creature.\nThe Fiend also has two exclusive spells \u2014 Burning Hands and Command.\nThe Great Old One\nThose serving The Great Old One are bound to a mysterious being from the Far Realm, who might not even know you exist, The Great Old One will grant you a feature exclusive to this subclass called \u201cMortal Reminder,\u201d which will frighten a creature and any nearby enemies after you land a critical hit unless they succeed a Wisdom saving throw.\nThe Great Old One also has two exclusive spells \u2014 Dissonant Whispers and Tasha\u2019s Hideous Laughter.\nThe Archfey\nIf you choose The Archfey as your subclass, your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature from before the time of mortal races.

For Warlocks, it\u2019s best to focus on weapon and armor proficiencies:\nDrow \u2019s Drow Weapon Training adds weapons like the rapiers and hand crossbows\n\u2019s Drow Weapon Training adds weapons like the rapiers and hand crossbows Humans \u2019 and Half-Elves \u2019 Civil Militia add spears, pikes, halberds, and glaives along with shields\n\u2019 and \u2019 Civil Militia add spears, pikes, halberds, and glaives along with shields Githyanki Martial Prodigy means you get medium armor along with longswords and greatswords\nMartial Prodigy means you get medium armor along with longswords and greatswords Dwarven Combat Training gets you battleaxes, handaxes, light hammers, and warhammers. The Shield Dwarf subrace also gets you Medium Armor\nWhen you\u2019re creating and leveling up your Warlock, Charisma (for spellcasting) is your most important stat. Your second most important stat kind of depends on how you play outside of combat, but Constitution is also a good option for the hit points \u2014 Warlocks, like Sorcerers, have a tendency to be glass cannons. Make Charisma your highest stat and Constitution your second highest.\nYou\u2019ll pick your Warlock subclass at level 1, but the pact you choose here is actually less important than the Eldritch Invocation you get at level 2 \u2014 that said, go with the Great Old One for the most broadly useful features. Your Eldritch Invocation powers up your Eldritch Blast spell \u2014 the bread-and-butter spell for Warlocks \u2014 and turns it into an Agonizing Blast.\nBest Warlock feats in BG3\nEvery four levels, you\u2019ll get the option to either increase your stats or choose a Feat. Feats are special talents that add features to your character. If you\u2019re happy with your stats and start taking Feats, Warlocks can benefit from:\nActor . Your Charisma Increases by 1, to a maximum of 20. Your Proficiency Bonus is also doubled for Deception and Performance Checks.\n. Your Charisma Increases by 1, to a maximum of 20. Your Proficiency Bonus is also doubled for Deception and Performance Checks. Elemental Adept . Your spells ignore Resistance to a damage type of your choice.

She explained at the time of the 2022 Academy Awards, when Will slapped Chris Rock, they had been separated for six years.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,\u201d Jada said. \u201cWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.\u201d\nThe pair have been married since 1997 and share son Jaden, 25, and daughter Willow, 22. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star also has a son Trey, 30, whom he shares with his first wife, Sheree Zampino.\nAs for her children, Jada praised them for how they\u2019ve helped her grow. \u201cMy children, they\u2019re little gurus. They\u2019ve taught me a deep sense of self-acceptance,\u201d she told the outlet.\nJada and Will have often opened up about their relationship over the years, and have had very public ups and downs throughout their marriage. Here\u2019s a timeline of their relationship.\n1994: Will and Jada meet on the set of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\nWill and Jada met after she auditioned for the role of Will\u2019s girlfriend on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. While she did not get the part, the pair hit it off - despite Will being married to Sheree Zampino at the time, with who he shares son Trey.\n\u201cI had a realisation I wasn\u2019t with the person I was supposed to be with,\u201d he told Jada\u2019s Red Table Talk in 2018. \u201cI was sitting in a [bathroom] stall and I was crying and laughing uncontrollably, and I knew [Jada] was the woman I was supposed to be with.\u201d\nWill and Jada in 2000 (Getty)\n1995: The pair officially begin dating\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1995 that Will and Jada began seriously dating after Will finalised his divorce from Zampino.\n1997: Will and Jada get engaged and married\nWill popped the question to Jada in November 1997 before getting married just one month later in Baltimore.\nJada wasn\u2019t initially sold on the idea of marriage. She told People in 2019: \u201cI never wanted to get married. But my mother was like: \u2018You have to get married\u2019 - she\u2019s so old-school - and Will wanted a family. So I said: \u2018All right, maybe it\u2019s something I should do.\u2019\u201d\n1998: Their first child is born\nJada and Will\u2019s first child together, son Jayden, was born in July 1998.\n2000: Their second child was born\nJada and Will welcomed daughter Willow in 2000.\nWill and Jada with their son Jayden in 2003 (Getty)\n2013: Jada denies open marriage rumours (sort of)\nAfter a quiet decade and a half making movies and raising their children, Jada took to Facebook to address rumours she and Will were in an open relationship.\nShe wrote: \u201cHere is how I will change my statement... Will and I BOTH can do WHATEVER we want, because we TRUST each other to do so. This does NOT mean we have an open relationship... this means we have a GROWN one.\u201d\n2015: Will addresses divorce rumours\nWill addresses persistent separation rumours by clarifying the pair were not getting a divorce.\n\u201cUnder normal circumstances, I don\u2019t usually respond to foolishness. But, so many people have extended [to] me their \u2018deepest condolences\u2019 that I figured - \u2018What the hell\u2026 I can be foolish, too!\u2019\u201d he wrote on Facebook at the time. \u201cSo, in the interest of redundant, repetitious, over and over-again-ness\u2026 Jada and I are\u2026 NOT GETTING A DIVORCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d\n2018: Will revealed that he and Jada don\u2019t refer to themselves as married\nIn an episode of TIDAL\u2019s Rap Radar podcast, Will said he and Jada \u201crefer to ourselves as life partners, where you get into that space where you realise you are literally with somebody for the rest of your life. There\u2019s no deal breakers. There\u2019s nothing she could do - ever. Nothing that would break our relationship. She has my support till death and it feels so good to get to that space.\u201d\n2020: August Alsina claims he had an affair with Jada\nAugust Alsina and Jada were introduced in 2015, but it wasn\u2019t until 2020 that he claimed that he and Jada had dated while she was married and that her and Will\u2019s marriage was open during that time.\nAlsina said Will gave him and Jada his \u201cblessing\u201d, adding: \u201cI actually sat down with Will and had a conversation due to the transformation from their marriage to life partnership that they\u2019ve spoken on several times and it not involving romanticism.\u201d\nAlsina added he \u201ctotally gave myself to that relationship for years of my life and I truly and really, really deeply loved and have a ton of love for her.\u201d\nThe same day Alsina\u2019s claims surfaced Jada\u2019s reps said they were \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d.\nLess than two weeks later, Jada and Will appeared on an episode of Jada\u2019s Red Table Talk where Jada confirmed that she did have a relationship with Alsina, saying that she and Will were separated at the time.\n\u201cWe decided that we were going to separate for a period of time and you go figure out how to make yourself happy and I\u2019ll figure out how to make myself happy,\u201d Jada said at the time.\n\u201cFrom there, as time went on, I got into a different kind of entanglement with August... Yes, it was a relationship absolutely.\u201d\nJada also said that Will didn\u2019t give permission, as the only person who could give her permission was herself.\n2021: Jada discusses her and Will\u2019s sex life, Will\u2019s memoir is released\nIn another episode of Red Table Talk in October 2021, Jada said it \u201ctakes work\u201d to maintain a spark in the bedroom.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard... the thing Will and I talk about a lot is the journey. We started in this [relationship] at a very young age, 22 years old... I think you expect your partner to know - especially when it comes to sex. It\u2019s like: \u2018Well, if you love me, you should know. If you love me, you should read my mind.\u2019 That\u2019s a huge pitfall,\u201d she said at the time.\nThe next month, Will\u2019s memoir is released which details several issues the couple have had over the years. He wrote they were \u201csuffering the brutal death of our romantic fantasies, the burning away of the idealistic illusion of the perfect marriage and the perfect family. Neither of us wanted a divorce; we knew we loved each other, and some aspects of our union were magical. But the structure of the life that we had established was strangling both of us.\u201d\n2022: No infidelity statement and Oscars incident\nDuring an interview on CBS Sunday Morning earlier this month, Will said he and Jada had never accused each other of cheating.\nHe said: \u201cNever. There\u2019s never been infidelity in our marriage...And we have never surprised one another with anything ever..I have decided that chatter about my life can be of a benefit to people. I think that chatter is the first stage to having a real conversation and being able to truly explore if some of the things in your heart are loving, or poisonous.\u201d\nIn March 2022, Will slapped Chris Rock at the 94th annual Oscars before he yelled at the comedian to \u201ckeep my wife\u2019s name out your f***ing mouth\u201d. It quickly became the most talked-about moment of the evening with the pair initially appearing to laugh off the tense moment.\nThe altercation came after Rock said: \u201cJada, I love you. GI Jane 2, can\u2019t wait to see you,\u201d referring to Jada\u2019s shaved head. While accepting the award for Best Actor, Will became teary as said he was a \u201cfierce defender of his family\u201d.\n\nThis article, authored by Laura Hampson and Meredith Clark, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-12 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":18}

{"title":"At 37, Alexandra found herself broke, heartbroken and living with her parents","context":"## At 37, Alexandra found herself broke, heartbroken and living with her parents\n\nWhile it was lovely to be taken care of, we all tend to regress when we\u2019re living with our parents. It\u2019s impossible not to feel infantilised, and there\u2019s a real tipping point where you start to lean into learnt helplessness. I stayed for four months before I moved out to house-sit a friend\u2019s place. Then I launched myself into dating to try to find a man to have a family with. After the roller-coaster of dating, I decided to start fertility treatment on my own, and by the time it began, I\u2019d found a stable job and was renting an apartment. When I got pregnant, I was elated but also terrified about how I would raise a kid on my own, financially and emotionally. Luckily, after I gave birth, my parents invited me to live with them, so I moved back for the first three months of my son\u2019s life. While it was wonderful to have the emotional and practical support, after three months I felt that If I didn\u2019t get out there to live as an independent person, I would quickly lose any sense of what I was capable of. But I\u2019m incredibly grateful for the time I had living with my parents; I know it\u2019s a huge privilege to have them as a safety net. I ended up writing a memoir, Inconceivable, about my journey to become a solo mum \u2013 and the complexities of being a woman in your late 30s who has to start over and move back in with your parents. I think while we\u2019re all embracing this contemporary feminist movement where women can create families of their own making, we\u2019re also realising that we need help, that parenthood can\u2019t happen alone.\u201d\n\u201cWe sold our home to go travelling and now we can\u2019t get back into the market\u201d Yearning for a tree change, Tess Moone, a 31-year-old travel writer, sold her Perth home only to discover that a suitable rental was almost impossible to find. \u201cOur initial \u2018quick stay\u2019 with Dane\u2019s parents has stretched out month after month.\u201d \u201cMy husband Dane and I became home owners at the age of 21. We thought we were doing all the right things; we bought a house 10 minutes from Perth\u2019s CBD, where I was working. But after the pandemic we began questioning our lifestyle choices. Did we really want to kill ourselves to pay a million-dollar mortgage in the city when we were leaning towards a tree change in Margaret River? So we sold our home in February and spent six months travelling around Europe and Japan. Our plan, once we returned to Perth, was to stay at Dane\u2019s parents\u2019 house while we looked for a rental in Margaret River. We figured we\u2019d be with my in-laws for three to four weeks, but we didn\u2019t realise how bad the rental crisis in the region is. We\u2019ve been offering more than the asking price and\/or offering more rent upfront to secure a place, but as there\u2019s a preference to rent to families or those who\u2019ve rented before, we keep getting knocked back. Our initial \u201cquick stay\u201d with Dane\u2019s parents has stretched out month after month. We\u2019re living in one of their spare rooms and have our boxes stored in another.\nI love my parents-in-law, so there have certainly been upsides. We\u2019re spending a lot of quality time together and they\u2019re really lovely about trying to give us as much space as possible, often booking weekends away so that Dane and I get the house to ourselves for a couple of days. We\u2019ve also worked out our perfect system for sharing the load; they\u2019ll cook dinner for half the week, for example, and we\u2019ll cook the other half, so the division of labour has been a positive experience. Loading The most challenging aspects? They\u2019re retired, so they\u2019re home a lot. And I work from home, so it\u2019s a little tougher for me than it is for Dane, who works in an office. I get lots of invitations from my mother-in-law to join her and her friends for lunch or coffee when I\u2019m supposed to be working, which is probably not the worst thing to complain about. Despite our love for his parents, the anxiety Dane and I have been feeling has increased as time\u2019s gone by. So much so that we\u2019ve just agreed to move into a friend\u2019s holiday home, sight unseen, even though we\u2019ll have to move back in with Dane\u2019s parents during the times the friend wants to use it, such as at Christmas. It isn\u2019t ideal, but it\u2019s one step back towards independence. If we\u2019d known then what we know now, we\u2019d never have sold our home.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a shame we don\u2019t value multi-generational living more than we do\u201d\nJob insecurity and financial practicality encouraged Rachel Claire, a 32-year-old photographer, to move back in with her parents in 2019. \u201cThe great thing about living with your parents when you\u2019re an adult yourself is that you don\u2019t take any of it for granted.\u201d \u201cMy parents and I have always been close. When I first moved out of home at the age of 22, my parents would always find reasons to pop by, whether it was just a quick visit after work or to fix things or mow my lawn. I could say they struggled with becoming empty-nesters, but I think it\u2019s more accurate to say we\u2019ve just always enjoyed each other\u2019s company. With my career as a photographer, I was in and out of the country a lot, spending money on rent when I wasn\u2019t often at home \u2013 crazy when you\u2019re in an industry where there\u2019s very little job security. Eventually, my parents said that maybe it was a good idea to move back home for a while so I could come and go with minimal financial impact while I was establishing myself. I wasn\u2019t so sure initially; I loved my freedom and struggled with the idea of falling back into traditional parent\/child roles in my late 20s. But when I started thinking about the benefits \u2013 particularly my parents\u2019 home security systems, which are very handy when you\u2019ve got expensive gear \u2013 I accepted and moved back in.\n\nThis article, authored by Dilvin Yasa, was published by The Age on 2023-11-25 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":20}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nFans have spotted Travis Kelce wearing a friendship bracelet with Taylor Swift lyrics on it, just days before she attended his Kansas City Chiefs game.\nIn a video posted to TikTok on 25 September, a fan shared a photo of Kelce posing with the piece of jewellery on his wrist. The post came after Swift was seen enthusiastically cheering him on in the box seats at Arrowhead Stadium, fuelling speculation that she and the athlete are dating.\nThe now-viral photo shows how Kelce may have hinted at the ongoing dating rumours before Swift attended his game. The snap showed Kelce posing at the Kelce Car Jam charity event on Friday 22 September, where he was sporting a beaded friendship bracelet that read: \u201cVigilante S***\u201d\nThe beads on the friendship bracelet appeared to reference Swift\u2019s song \u201cVigilante S***\u201d from her 2022 album, Midnights. In addition to the Swiftie-themed jewellery, Kelce also wore a white striped shirt with silver chain necklaces, black sunglasses, and black pants for the event.\nIn the comments, fans both praised and questioned Kelce for the beaded friendship bracelet. Many people also pointed out how fans of the \u201cBad Blood\u201d singer famously trade and wear friendship bracelets at Swift\u2019s Eras Tour concerts.\n\u201cOF ALL 230 SONGS IN THE DISCOGRAPHY I\u2019M SICK,\u201d one fan commented, while another person wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how invested I am in this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna need to go back and see all photos of him from the last three months and dissect if he\u2019s wearing friendship bracelets,\u201d a third wrote.\nIn other photos from the charity event - which were shared to Instagram by Jordan\u2019s KC photography - Kelce wasn\u2019t seen wearing the friendship bracelet, leading many people to believe that he received the bracelet from a fan that day.\nTwo days after his charity event, the \u201cAll Too Well\u201d singer was spotted cheering for the Kansas City Chiefs tight end from the box seats at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Not only was she seen sitting next to Kelce\u2019s mother, Donna, but she also appeared to yell \u201clet\u2019s f***ing go\u201d in response to Kelce\u2019s third-quarter touchdown reception.\nAfter the game, which saw the Chiefs beat the Chicago Bears 41-10, Kelce was seen leaving the stadium in a blue and white splatter-paint denim suit. Eagle-eyed fans were quick to believe that Kelce\u2019s outfit paid homage to Swift\u2019s forthcoming album, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), which is due for re-release on 27 October.\nAfter the two escaped the crowd at Arrowhead Stadium in Kelce\u2019s convertible, according to photos and videos posted online, the football star reportedly rented out Prime Social Rooftop in Kansas City for a post-game celebration with his family, his teammates, and Swift.\n\u201cTravis bought out the restaurant for his family and team. Taylor arrived, wearing a denim dress, and was seen snacking, having some cocktails and dancing alongside Travis,\u201d the witness told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cThe two were very affectionate with one another but kept things fun and lighthearted. Travis\u2019 teammates also showed up to the after-party, as well as his mom, Donna Kelce. The party lasted until 2 am.\u201d\nThe late-night outing came days after the NFL star officially addressed ongoing dating rumours about him and the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer. During an episode of The Pat McAfee Show on 21 September, he mocked his brother Jason Kelce for joking that he \u201c100 per cent\u201d believed his younger sibling was dating Swift.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hilarious how much traction this has actually gotten, right now it\u2019s like a game of telephone,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cWhere everybody\u2019s whispering in each other\u2019s ears and hearing random stuff. No one actually knows what\u2019s going on, especially when you got Jason Kelce on live television telling people just both sides - he doesn\u2019t know, it\u2019s true, this and that.\u201d\nHe also noted that he was still open to pursuing a relationship with Swift, revealing that he subtly asked if she\u2019d want to attend one of his football games.\n\u201cI threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court,\u201d he said. \u201cI told her, you know, I\u2019ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one\u2019s a little more lit. So, we\u2019ll see what happens in the near future.\u201d\nBack in July, Kelce first confessed that he tried - and failed - to give Swift his number by giving her a friendship bracelet at one of her Eras Tour concerts. \u201cI was disappointed that she doesn\u2019t talk before or after her shows, because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,\u201d he explained to his brother on their podcast.\n\u201cSo I was a little butthurt I didn\u2019t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cIf you\u2019re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-09-26 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":21}
{"title":"THE GREATEST! Boks beat All Blacks in instant classic to claim record FOURTH RWC in controversial, dramatic final","context":"## THE GREATEST! Boks beat All Blacks in instant classic to claim record FOURTH RWC in controversial, dramatic final\n\nSTADE DE FRANCE \u2013 Twenty-eight years between drinks and drama was always on the cards between these two great foes. Little did we know just how much.\nBut just like that famous win at Ellis Park where Nelson Mandela handed over the William Webb Ellis Cup to Francois Pienaar, it was the Springboks who once again prevailed 12-11 in an instant classic.\nUnlike the blue skies that greeted Johannesburg and the Boeing 747 plane that sent shivers down the spines of everyone in attendance in 1995, rain and dampness poured down on the Stade de France.\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\nYet, nothing was going to dampen this evening as 80,065 fans poured in.\nIn a match of controversy, where cards of yellow and red were handed out quicker than a game of Uno, thundering shots both legal and illegal were put on by rugby\u2019s two greatest sides.\nSam Cane \u2013 the All Blacks captain \u2013 was forced to watch the match from the sidelines for 53 minutes after having his yellow card for a high shot on Jesse Kriel upgraded to red. His opposite in the number seven jersey, Siya Kolisi, was later shown a yellow card for a high shot on Ardie Savea, but returned.\nCheslin Kolbe \u2013 the magnificent winger who sealed their World Cup triumph four years earlier against England \u2013 meanwhile couldn\u2019t bare to watch from the sidelines after being shown a yellow card for a deliberate knockdown in the 73rd minute.\nAdvertisement\nIt was that kind of evening, where the margins were tiny and the outcomes almighty.\n\u201cThere are no ways I can explain it,\u201d Kolisi said.\n\u201cI want to give credit to the All Blacks. They took us to the end, they took us to a dark place. It shows what kind of team they are, to fight with a man down from early in the game. They put us under so much pressure.\n\u201cCredit to my boys too for the fight. I am just grateful we could pull it off.\u201d\nSpeaking of mighty, Pieter-Steph du Toit \u2013 the 2019 World Rugby player of the year \u2013 played his best match in four years as he spearheaded the Springboks\u2019 physical onslaught. The back-rower made 28 tackles, each as bone-crunching as the next.\nAdvertisement\nBy claiming their third one-point knockout victory in a row, the Springboks moved into uncharted territory by leapfrogging the All Blacks by sealing their fourth World Cup. It was the second straight tournament the Springboks won in France, having beaten England at the same venue in 2007.\nA missed Richie Mo\u2019unga conversion following Beauden Barrett\u2019s 58th minute try \u2013 the only five-pointer of the match \u2013 ultimately proved the difference, as Handre Pollard\u2019s four three-pointers led the Springboks to World Cup glory.\nThe All Blacks had their chances, but their usual safe handling, a feature throughout the World Cup after their first-up loss to France, evaded them against the Springboks\u2019 blitz defence in the wet conditions.\nAll night the All Blacks\u2019 timing was off and the forced ball from Savea out wide just as the men in black saw space and looked to open up the Springboks in the 80th minute proved to be killer blow.\nWayne Barnes, who was booed relentlessly, called a scrum reset as the seconds ticked by.\nAdvertisement\nMoments later, their hearts sunk as the Springboks managed to win the scrum and then hang onto the ball.\nThe victory was the perfect sign-off for the Springboks\u2019 management, with director of rugby Rassie Erasmus set to follow head coach Jacques Nienaber out.\nThe duo will go down as the greatest coaching duo in rugby history, having led the Springboks to back-to-back World Cup triumphs.\n\u201cWe came a long way with the players. We always planned for this World Cup, since 2018,\u201d Nienaber said.\n\u201cMassive credit to our fans. They were special from South Africa, 62 million people, the videos we had to play from them. It was unbelievable.\u201d\nVeteran back-rower Duane Vermeulen will also call time on his illustrious career.\nAll Blacks coach Ian Foster\u2019s tenure in charge has also come to an end, with Scott Robertson to take over following a bumpy four years in charge.\nAdvertisement\nRobertson will have an almighty task on his hand, with multiple generational players including Dane Coles, Sam Whitelock, Brodie Retallick and Aaron Smith to call time on their international careers. Others like Ardie Savea, Mo\u2019unga, Beauden Barrett and Shannon Frizell will also head to Japan.\nWhile Foster didn\u2019t want to take anything away from the Springboks\u2019 win, he said the game had some issues to sort out regarding the officiating.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of our guys, to go down to that red card so early and fight our way back and give ourselves a chance is pretty special,\u201d the departing All Blacks coach said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it went wrong in any clear [place on the pitch], it was a real arm wrestle, both teams have their moment, incredibly proud of the way we fought and to get within a whisker of pulling it off is heart-breaking.\n\u201cThis group is very proud to be All Blacks, very proud to play for their country and have worked incredibly hard to get here.\n\u201cWhile I am so proud of what we did and how we worked we have to give it to South Africa, they are a quality team. They have had a few close victories in this tournament and are a different class. It\u2019s special for them but it equally hurts for us. I can\u2019t ask for much more than we did, we couldn\u2019t put more out on the park.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nControversy was on display from the outset, as Frizell was shown a yellow card for an illegal cleanout on Springboks hooker Bongi Mbonambi. The incident saw the hooker, who was cleared earlier in the week by World Rugby following an alleged racial slur on England back-rower Tom Curry, replaced by Deon Fourie in the third minute.\nThe penalty allowed Pollard to step up and bang over three points.\nThe All Blacks were on the backfoot much of the opening quarter and, after Ethan de Groot was pinged for not rolling away, the Springboks moved further ahead after 12 minutes.\nA wicked bounce following a lovely Jordie Barrett chip kick denied Savea a try soon after. But the All Blacks were on the scoreboard via Mo\u2019unga moments later as Barnes was playing advantage.\nBut the Springboks restored their six-point lead soon after as Savea was pinged for not releasing. Barnes later apologised, with the No.8 having a split-second separation.\nThe Springboks\u2019 rush defence caused the All Blacks problems all evening, as Damian de Allende and Kriel forced their opponents into errors. Will Jordan, the impressive young outside back who scored eight tries, had a difficult night and was replaced midway through the second half.\nThe biggest error was around the corner, as Kriel stepped back into the defence and Cane failed to drop his body height and clocked the centre in the jaw. He didn\u2019t return.\nAdvertisement\nThe Springboks took a 12-3 lead after 34 minutes when the All Blacks once again failed to release on their goal line. Pollard licked his lips and said \u2018thanks\u2019.\nThe All Blacks managed to cut the deficit to 12-6 after 37 minutes when Eben Etzebeth was caught offside and denied his opponents some quick ball.\nFoster\u2019s men breathed a sigh of relief when Kolisi blew a chance out wide when he tucked the ball under his arms and went himself after Beauden Barrett failed to collect a high ball in the 42nd minute.\nMinutes later and Kolisi was off, as he cannoned into Savea. He would later return, much to the anger of the New Zealanders in the crowd who were calling for justice.\nSensing an opportunity to strike against 14 men, the All Blacks kicked for the corner on a couple occasions out wide. It came back to haunt them, as their usually silky and composed skill sets failed them.\nThat much was true when the TMO intervened after Smith thought he had a try in his final Test, but an error at the lineout cancelled out the five-pointer.\nAdvertisement\nEventually the All Blacks did have a try, as Mark Telea, the All Blacks\u2019 best and biggest attacking threat all night, managed to get on the outside and draw in two defenders before offloading to Beauden Barrett. But Mo\u2019unga missed the conversion to leave them trailing by a point.\nThat lone point would prove the difference, as the Springboks celebrated a remarkable victory by a remarkable side.\n\nThis article, authored by Christy Doran, was published by The Roar | Sports Writers Blog on 2023-10-28 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":22}

They have a rich history of overachieving at the World Cup and have done a fantastic job to get here at the same level we are, so it is going to be a heck of a game.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nFoster said the All Blacks, who suffered a shock semi-final loss to Eddie Jones\u2019 England in 2019, never consider themselves favourites.\n\u201cFirstly, you\u2019ve never heard us say we\u2019re favourites,\u201d he said.\n\u2018We know these games are do or die. We\u2019re going to have to improve our performance. The stage gets bigger at this time in the tournament and you\u2019ve got to grow your game. That\u2019s our strong focus.

They make you think of high-level skills in a really open game but there are always threats in the lineout, mauls and rucks,\u201d said Cheika, whose Wallabies lost in the 2015 final.\n\u201cYou have to take the moments you are in the game and see them coming at you at different times.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIn the game in 2020 there were things you could pinpoint.

{"title":"After warning, the EU opens investigation into X over alleged disinformation","context":"## After warning, the EU opens investigation into X over alleged disinformation\n\nEU turns up the heat on X over illegal content in wake of Israel-Hamas war\nThe European Union is cranking up the heat on Elon Musk-owned X. Late Thursday, the Commission sent the company a formal request for more information \u2014 after issuing a public warning Wednesday about reports that illegal content and disinformation targeting the Israel-Hamas war is circulating on the platform, and Twitter\u2019s CEO sending a high-level (non specific) response to that warning.\nThe move could prefigure the opening of a formal investigation of X under the bloc\u2019s content moderation rulebook, the Digital Services Act (DSA). If the Commission moves ahead on that, it will be the first investigation opened under the DSA since a compliance deadline for so called \u201cvery large online platforms\u201d (aka VLOPs) kicked in this summer.\nNon-compliance under DSA rules, meanwhile, could trigger fines of up to 6% of annual turnover, plus potential blocking of a service for repeated infringements. X owner Elon Musk last projected revenues of about $3 billion for this year. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess if that\u2019s accurate now, but as an example, that would result in a fine of up to $180 million.\nIndirectly, an investigation will also be a key way for the public to have significantly more transparency around how X is being used (and abused): since Musk took Twitter private, the company no longer produces quarterly earnings reports and is not held to account as closely as a result.\nEU officials confirmed to TechCrunch that an investigation has not been taken at this point. Clearly, though, yesterday\u2019s development (and the pace at which regulators are moving) is a strong indication of the bloc\u2019s direction of travel.\nThe Commission said it is looking at X\u2019s compliance with the DSA across a number of areas \u2014 including with regard to its policies and practices regarding notices on illegal content; complaint handling; risk assessment and measures to mitigate the risks identified.\nOn Wednesday, in an \u201curgent\u201d letter to Musk, the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner Thierry Breton said the bloc had seen \u201cindications\u201d from \u201cqualified sources\u201d that X is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU\u201d following Saturday\u2019s attacks \u2014 before reminding X of the DSA\u2019s \u201cvery precise obligations\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis content moderation.\n\u201cWhen you receive notices of illegal content in the EU, you must be timely, diligent and objective in taking action and removing the relevant content when warranted,\u201d Breton also warned then.\nIn its latest press release, the EU said it has sent X a formal request for information under the DSA.\n\u201cThis request follows indications received by the Commission services of the alleged spreading of illegal content and disinformation, in particular the spreading of terrorist and violent content and hate speech,\u201d it wrote, adding that the ask also addresses other aspects of DSA compliance.\nThe pan-EU regulation puts a series of governance obligations on digital services and platforms with the aim of ensuring companies are responding to reports of illegal content. They must also clearly communicate their T&Cs to users and be able to demonstrate proper enforcement.\nLarger platforms like X also have additional obligations to identify and mitigate systemic risks such as disinformation, gender-based violence or negative effects on the exercise of fundamental rights.\nAdditionally, the regulation includes a \u201ccrisis response\u201d mechanism (Article 36) which enables the Commission to adopt rapid-fire measures on larger platforms in situations of \u201cserious threat\u201d, such as war.\nSince Saturday\u2019s attacks in Israel, posts identified as false have been spotted circulating on X \u2014 including, in one example, a clip that purported to show Hamas missile attacks on Israel but was actually footage from a video game.\nMeanwhile X\u2019s ability to respond internally to reports of content problems have been drastically pared back after Musk\u2019s takeover last year \u2014 which saw major layoffs, including in content moderation and human rights as part of the new billionaire owner\u2019s bid to improve the platform\u2019s profitability.\nIn response to the EU\u2019s warning earlier this week, X CEO Linda Yaccarino released a letter saying that a leadership group had been convened to consider X\u2019s response and \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of pieces of content had been removed, along with \u201cthousands\u201d of posts and \u201chundreds\u201d of accounts linked to terrorist groups, violence or extremism.\nShe also said the company formerly known as Twitter is responding to law enforcement requests but claimed it had not received any requests from Europol at the time.\nToday @lindayaX responded to @ThierryBreton\u2019s letter detailing our work in response to the terrorist attack on Israel. pic.twitter.com\/yZtaOVGpHG \u2014 Global Government Affairs (@GlobalAffairs) October 12, 2023\nIn further remarks via X\u2019s safety account, the company reported that there had been more than 50 million posts globally over the past two days that referenced the weekend\u2019s terrorist attack, underlining the scope of content generated.\nX has been pushing a so-called Community Notes feature \u2014 which crowdsources additional context to add to questionable tweets \u2014 as its main response to disinformation risks.\nBy Thursday afternoon, Hamas\u2019 attack had killed more than 1,200 people, per the Israeli Military, and at least 1,537 people had been killed in Gaza by Israel\u2019s retaliatory strikes, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.\nReturning to the EU process, X has until October 18 to provide the bloc with information about \u201cthe activation and functioning of X\u2019s crisis response protocol\u201d; and until October 31 to respond to its other requests.\n\u201cBased on the assessment of X replies, the Commission will assess next steps,\u201d the Commission wrote. \u201cThis could entail the formal opening of proceedings pursuant to Article 66 of the DSA.\u201d\nIt also noted the regulation includes powers to impose fines for \u201cincorrect, incomplete or misleading information in response to a request for information\u201d.\n\u201cIn case of failure to reply by X, the Commission may decide to request the information by decision. In this case, failure to reply by the deadline could lead to the imposition of period penalties,\u201d the EU added.\nEarlier this year, Musk pulled out of the EU\u2019s Code of Practice on online disinformation. In a response to X leaving the voluntary Code, Breton warned: \u201cObligations remain. You can run but you can\u2019t hide.\u201d\nIn recent days, TikTok and Meta have also been warned by the EU over disinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war. But back in September, a study commissioned via the EU\u2019s Code of Practice suggested X is the worst of the major platforms when it comes to spreading disinformation.\nThis report was substantially revised to clarify a number of aspects, including \u2014 most saliently \u2014 that the EU has sent a formal request for information to X at this point. This could prefigure a formal announcement of an investigation but is not, yet, that formal technical step. We also clarified the scale of financial penalties possible under the DSA if a breach is confirmed; and added details of the regulation\u2019s crisis response mechanism. We also fixed an error in the original report which referred to Interpol, rather than Europol.\n\nThis article, authored by Catherine Shu, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-13 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":24}
{"title":"EU fires urgent warning at Elon Musk\u2019s X over illegal content and disinformation following Hamas attacks","context":"## EU fires urgent warning at Elon Musk\u2019s X over illegal content and disinformation following Hamas attacks\n\nIn a very swift test of the European Union\u2019s newly updated content moderation rulebook, the bloc has fired a public warning at Elon Musk\u2013owned X (formerly Twitter) for failing to tackle illegal content circulating on the platform in the wake of Saturday\u2019s deadly attacks on Israel by Hamas terrorists based in the Gaza Strip.\nThe European Commission has also raised concerns about the spread of disinformation on X related to the terrorist attacks and their aftermath.\nUnlike terrorism content, disinformation is not illegal in the EU per se. However, the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) puts an obligation on X \u2014 as a so-called very large online platform \u2014 to mitigate risks attached to harmful falsehoods as well as to act diligently on reports of illegal content.\nFollowing the terrorist attacks by Hamas against \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1, we have indications of X\/Twitter being used to disseminate illegal content & disinformation in the EU. Urgent letter to @elonmusk on #DSA obligations \u2935\ufe0f pic.twitter.com\/avMm1LHq54 \u2014 Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) October 10, 2023\nGraphic videos apparently showing terrorist attacks on civilians have been circulating on X since Saturday, along with other content, including some posts that purport to show footage from the attacks inside Israel or Israel\u2019s subsequent retaliation on targets in the Gaza Strip but which fact-checkers have identified as false.\nThe Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians and tourists, which took place after militants inside Gaza managed to get past border fences and mount a series of surprise attacks, have been followed by Israel\u2019s prime minister declaring \u201cwe are at war\u201d and its military retaliating by firing scores of missiles into the Gaza Strip.\nA number of videos posted to X since the attacks have been identified as entirely unrelated to the conflict \u2014 including footage that was filmed last month in Egypt and even a clip from a video game that had been posted to the platform with a (false) claim it showed Hamas missile attacks on Israel.\nA Wired report yesterday summed up the chaotic situation playing out on Musk\u2019s platform in an article entitled \u201cThe Israel-Hamas War Is Drowning X in Disinformation.\u201d\nAt one point, Musk himself even recommended people follow accounts that had posted antisemitic comments and false information in the past \u2014 although he subsequently deleted the tweet where he had made the suggestion.\nThis video certainly doesn't show a new air assault on Israel by Hamas militants, because it's actually from the video game Arma 3. pic.twitter.com\/IcX7xs8QDp \u2014 Shayan Sardarizadeh (@Shayan86) October 9, 2023\nLast night, we saw a totally false claim about Israel bombing a church in Gaza go viral, thanks to multiple blue tick accounts repeating an unverified claim that had no evidence to back it up. Musk has created a fundamental issue with Twitter's credibility in moments of crisis. https:\/\/t.co\/T70G2oNDZH \u2014 Eliot Higgins (@EliotHiggins) October 10, 2023\nThe problem for Musk is the DSA regulates how social media platforms and other services that carry user-generated content must respond to reports of illegal content like terrorism.\nIt also puts legal obligation on larger platforms \u2014 including X \u2014 to mitigate risks from disinformation. So the fast-moving and bloody events unfolding in Israel and Gaza are offering a real-world test of whether the EU\u2019s rebooted rulebook is big and beefy enough to tackle X\u2019s most notorious shitposter. Who, since last fall, is also the platform\u2019s owner.\nSince taking over Twitter (as it was then), Musk has painted the largest target on X when it comes to DSA enforcement on account of a series of changes he\u2019s pushed out that make it harder for users to locate quality information on X.\nThis includes ending legacy account verification and turning the Blue Check system into a game of pay-to-play. He\u2019s also ripped up a bunch of legacy content moderation policies and slashed in-house enforcement teams while promoting a decentralized, crowdsourced alternative (rebranded as Community Notes), which essentially outsources responsibility for dealing with tricky issues like disinformation to users in what looks suspiciously like another gambit to eke out extra engagement and farm confusion by applying a philosophy of extreme relativism so culture warriors are encouraged to keep forever fighting for their own \u201ctruth\u201d in the comments.\nOh and he also pulled X out of the EU\u2019s Code of Practice on Disinformation earlier this year in a very clear thumb of the nose to EU regulators.\nUrgent letter to Musk\nIn an \u201curgent\u201d letter to Musk today, which the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner Thierry Breton also shared on X, the bloc has sent the strongest signal yet it believes Musk\u2019s platform is in breach of the DSA \u2014 although this is by no means Musk\u2019s first warning.\nA rule of law clash between Musk and the EU has looked increasingly inevitable in recent months \u2014 and, indeed, has been predicted by some industry watchers since rumors of the erratic billionaire\u2019s plan to take over Twitter emerged last year.\nReminder: Penalties for confirmed breaches of the DSA can be as high as 6% of global annual turnover. The bloc also has powers, in extremis, which could result in access to X being shut off in the region if the platform repeatedly fails to correct course. So if Musk fails to satisfy EU regulators, he could face serious consequences for what remains a highly indebted business.\nIn his letter to Musk, Breton writes that the EU has \u201cindications\u201d that X is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU\u201d following Saturday\u2019s attacks. He then goes on to remind the company of the DSA\u2019s \u201cvery precise obligations\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis content moderation.\n\u201cWhen you receive notices of illegal content in the EU, you must be timely, diligent and objective in taking action and removing the relevant content when warranted,\u201d he warns. \u201cWe have, from qualified sources, reports about potentially illegal content circulating on your service despite flags from relevant authorities.\u201d\nHe also takes issue with a change X made last night to its public interest policy, under which it judges newsworthiness (i.e., for deciding whether posts that infringe its rules may nonetheless remain on the site) \u2014 but which Breton says have left \u201cmany European users uncertain\u201d (i.e., about how X is applying its own rules).\nAgain, this is a problem because the DSA requires platforms to be clear and transparent about their rules and how they apply them. \u201cThis is particularly relevant when it comes to violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform,\u201d Breton continues in another pointed warning.\nX should have \u201cproportionate and effective mitigation measures\u201d in place to tackle \u201cthe risks to public security and civic discourse stemming from disinformation,\u201d he also says.\nInstead, the platform appears to be turning into an engine of disinformation \u2014 one that\u2019s demonstrably enabled the very swift amplification of a smorgasbord of toxic fakes around the Israel-Hamas war. Falsehoods that may be trying to manipulate opinion around the conflict, or otherwise exploit horrific events to drive engagement (clickbait) or for even more bleak, cynical and potentially harmful ends.\n\u201cPublic media and civil society organisations widely report instances of fake and manipulated images and facts circulating on your platform in the EU, such as repurposed old images of unrelated armed conflicts or military footage that actually originated from video games. This appears to be manifestly false or misleading information,\u201d writes Breton. \u201cI therefore invite you to urgently ensure that your systems are effective, and report on the crisis measures taken to my team.\u201d\nAsking Musk to be \u201ceffective\u201d against disinformation is a bit like asking the sea to stop moving. But, well, this is how the regulatory dance must go (and after the dance comes the denouement \u2014 which, if a DSA breach is confirmed, means enforcement. And actual penalties might be a bit harder for Musk to troll).\nIn the meantime, the EU has asked Musk to make contact with relevant law enforcement authorities and Europol \u2014 and \u201censure that you respond promptly to their requests.\u201d Breton also flags some unspecified additional DSA compliance issues he says his team will be contacting Musk\u2019s about \u201cshortly\u201d \u2014 \u201cwith a specific request.\u201d. (We\u2019ve asked the EU what else it\u2019s concerned about on X and will update this report with any response.)\nThe bloc has given Musk a deadline of 24 hours to respond to its asks at this point \u2014 stipulating his answer will be added to its assessment file on X\u2019s compliance with the DSA. \u201cI remind you that following the opening of a potential investigation and a finding of non-compliance, penalties can be imposed,\u201d Breton adds, concluding the letter.\nWe\u2019ve asked the Commission to confirm whether it has opened an investigation into X\u2019s DSA compliance over concerns it\u2019s raised in the letter. Perhaps it\u2019s going to wait a day to see what his response is before taking that next dance step.\nMusk\u2019s extremely iterative \u2014 or just plain erratic\/arbitrary \u2014 management style is so far from the responsive and responsible qualities the EU\u2019s rulebook demands of digital leaders it\u2019s hard to see how this clash can end well for either side.\nWe contacted X for a response to the EU\u2019s warnings about its DSA compliance but at press time the company had not responded \u2014 beyond firing back its usual automated reply, which reads: \u201cBusy now, please check back later.\u201d\nBut at the time of writing, Musk had engaged in a bit of a dance of his own with the news of the EU\u2019s warning by responding to a critical tweet posted to X by journalist Glenn Greenwald, who attacked the EU\u2019s new \u201ccensorship law,\u201d as he dubbed the DSA \u2014 which he claimed would be used to \u201cpunish X.\u201d\nIn reply to Greenwald, Musk avoided expressing the same trenchant criticism of the EU\u2019s approach but invited yet more relativism \u2014 writing: \u201cLet the public hear exactly what this disinformation consists of and decide for themselves.\u201d\nHe then went on to sew doubt that disinformation is something that can be independently arbitrated at all, implying fact-checking is just a convenient exercise for targeting different opinions \u2014 so essentially echoing Greenwald\u2019s position \u2014 by claiming that \u201cmany times\u201d the \u201cofficial fact-checker\u201d has been found making false statements, before adding a rhetorically empty offer that \u201cMaybe this is the case here, maybe not\u201d for good, plausible deniability measure.\nIn another recent tweet-response Musk can also be seen chipping into another conversation in which an X user has commented on a screengrab of an apparent exchange of threats between Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and an official Israeli government account in relation to the war \u2014 with Musk writing: \u201cAmazing to see this exchange!\u201d\nThe irony here is Musk\u2019s destruction of Twitter\u2019s legacy verification of notable accounts means you can\u2019t, at a glance, be sure if the exchange really happened.\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-10 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":25}
{"title":"Why Mozilla is betting on a decentralized social networking future","context":"## Why Mozilla is betting on a decentralized social networking future\n\nConsumers are hungry for a new way of social networking, where trust and safety are paramount and power isn\u2019t centralized with a Big Tech CEO in charge\u2026 or at least that\u2019s what Mozilla believes. The mission-driven tech company behind the Firefox browser, Pocket reader and other apps is now investing its energy into the so-called \u201cfediverse\u201d \u2014 a collection of decentralized social networking applications, like Mastodon, that communicate with one another over the ActivityPub protocol.\nThe idea is to rethink social networking from the ground up.\nToday, social networks are often run by large corporations \u2014 like Meta, Snap and Google \u2014 where advertisers pay the bills. This has created a world where modern social networks are profit-driven, and consumer needs aren\u2019t always at the forefront, Mozilla believes. This disconnect between what people want and what today\u2019s networks offer hit an inflection point last year, when billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter, leading to a surge of interest in alternatives to centralized social networking, including apps like Mastodon and Bluesky.\nUnder Musk, Twitter \u2014 now called X \u2014 has prioritized \u201cfree speech\u201d managed by crowdsourced-based moderation. Its policies have resulted in increased hate speech and toxic content on the platform, some studies have shown.\nMozilla believes there\u2019s a better way forward and, more importantly, that now is exactly the right time to invest in that path. And, as a wholly owned subsidiary of a nonprofit, the company says it\u2019s not motivated by generating earnings for shareholders or returning a VC investment, allowing it to progress with a collaborative approach where it takes in input from a lot of different voices.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Mozilla Senior Director of Content Carolyn O\u2019Hara explained why Mozilla has taken an interest in the fediverse and Mastodon, specifically, and how it expects to experiment in the months ahead.\nFor background, the company announced its plans to enter the fediverse in December 2022 and this May launched a private beta for Mozilla.social, a Mastodon server \u2014 or \u201cinstance\u201d in fediverse parlance \u2014 that will allow consumers to participate in this new form of social networking where problems like misinformation, harassment and issues around worsening mental health are minimized.\nThe company\u2019s work on its social efforts is also available publicly on GitHub. (Of interest to technical folks, the company is using a forked version of Elk as its alternative web client for its Mastodon server, which is what gives it its slick look and feel.)\nMozilla\u2019s involvement, says O\u2019Hara, came about because the company looked at the history of social media over the past decade and didn\u2019t like what it saw.\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s a pretty poor track record by existing companies that are only model motivated by profit and just insane user growth, and are willing to tolerate and amplify really toxic content because it looks like engagement,\u201d she says. \u201c[They] aren\u2019t just putting forward the kind of standards that are good for people, but are just good for their bottom lines.\u201d\nPlus, she adds, consumers are now becoming aware of this, which is new.\n\u201cConsumers feel that the vibes are off a little bit\u2026these platforms aren\u2019t necessarily working in their best interests, or satisfying them,\u201d O\u2019Hara points out.\nFor Mozilla, that discontent presented an opportunity to enter the social networking space and compete for consumers\u2019 attention. In its case, however, the broader goal is to help the fediverse itself gain traction, not just its own Mastodon server.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeking to get, like 2 billion users on our instance. We want people to have choice and agency,\u201d says O\u2019Hara, adding that choice is in line with Mozilla\u2019s values.\nHowever, the company is aiming to tackle some of the obstacles that have prevented users from joining and participating in the fediverse so far, including the technical hurdles around onboarding, finding people to follow and discovering interesting content to discuss.\nFor starters, users will join the Mozilla.social instance with their Mozilla accounts, which also provides access to the Firefox browser, Mozilla\u2019s VPN, Pocket and other products, simplifying access to its suite of tools. The instance isn\u2019t yet open to the public, but is experimenting with hundreds of users for the time being.\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping the number intentionally small and we\u2019re prioritizing the groups that we\u2019re proactively reaching out to,\u201d O\u2019Hara explained. \u201cThe communities we\u2019ve worked with previously will have first access to the private beta, some of which will include folks from the waitlist.\u201d\nThe timeline to a public launch isn\u2019t yet determined, as the company plans to experiment with various expansions and features throughout next year.\nFor example, Mozilla is currently experimenting with a Discover feed that aims to surface engaging content. Over time, it plans to gather more signals from around the fediverse to determine what sort of content people are interacting with. It also sees a role for its read-it-later app Pocket in this experience, as the app\u2019s primary use case is to store links to articles and other content that people have signaled they want to read.\n\u201cWe are planning to open the beta in phases because we want to ensure that we have a content moderation team and other tools that can be scaled relative to the size of the user base. We\u2019re not in a rush as we think it\u2019s important to be deliberate about launching social media tools,\u201d O\u2019Hara says.\n\u201cWe have a lot of core competency that we brought over from our Pocket experience and other recommendation products that we put together to at least get that engine revving,\u201d notes O\u2019Hara.\nInitially, the company is running a Mastodon account, \u201c@Pocket_Recommends@mozilla.social,\u201d where it actively posts recommendations of stories to read. It\u2019s the same sort of content you might find in the Pocket email newsletter, but now distributed on the fediverse.\nThe company also wants to address the needs of creators and publishers who want to broaden their audience as it moves forward with its fediverse plans.\n\u201cFrom a content discovery standpoint, I\u2019m really interested in how we can seed conversations and seed experiences with really high-quality content \u2014 certainly, editorial publisher content,\u201d says O\u2019Hara. \u201cHow can we get publishers and content providers involved early?\u2026 I think of them as a real constituency for us,\u201d she says. Plus, Mozilla wants to bring in the originators whose posts lead to interesting conversations and keep the network active.\nO\u2019Hara says Mozilla is now in active discussions with publishers to understand their needs, including both their social needs and business needs, and how those goals may have changed over the past year. As part of these discussions, Mozilla aims to convince publishers that Mastodon isn\u2019t just another place they have to support, but one that could deliver on their objectives. As it learns from the publishers and other content creators what they want and need, it then intends to use that understanding to build features and drive efforts that can help them reach their audiences.\nSo far, what Mozilla has learned is that publishers today feel somewhat resigned and pessimistic about social networks. Twitter isn\u2019t driving much traffic and, even though Instagram Threads appears interesting, Meta specifically said it wasn\u2019t going to prioritize news on that platform. What Mozilla wants to accomplish, then, is to help reconfigure the Mastodon onboarding process so that when someone \u2014 including a publisher or creator \u2014 joins its instance (or the fediverse in general) they\u2019re able to build their audience with more ease.\n\u201cThe baseline is just better onboarding, better connecting with accounts and communities,\u201d explains O\u2019Hara. \u201cYou might be interested in spaces where you can have the kinds of conversations that you want to be able to have; trust and safety practices that make you feel safe in order to participate. And I think also then access to content that spurs those conversations and seeds those conversations. And it all being kind of a delightful user experience \u2014 but we\u2019re at the early days of that,\u201d she adds.\nAnother avenue of thought is to create spaces within the fediverse where consumers can have civil and direct conversations within smaller communities, instead of shouting into the void, so to speak. As to what that will look like, is less clear. Will it be different instances or just new ways of forming communities, by building out features or experiences? O\u2019Hara couldn\u2019t say, only noting that experimentation will be needed.\nImportantly, trust and safety will also be key to Mozilla\u2019s instance. Its content policies indicate strict measures around hate speech, impersonation, self-harm, harassment, misinformation, violent and sexualized content, and more, in addition to illegal content, like CSAM (child sexual abuse material) and promotion of illegal goods.\nBut there\u2019s a chance that playing it too safe can make a product less compelling as a Twitter\/X alternative. That\u2019s one takeaway, at least, from the recent shutdown of Pebble (formerly T2), a Twitter clone that put trust and safety at the forefront of its development process. The app never gained more than 20,000 users, and the founders now believe that its approach to moderation may have been correct, but it wasn\u2019t a growth driver. In other words, people may say they want to feel safer when participating online, but clearly, that isn\u2019t their only need.\nMozilla\u2019s instance, still in private testing, has a small team of moderators that will grow when the instance launches to the public in the coming months.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a commitment, it\u2019s beyond foundational for us \u2014 that is the thing that is going to be true about this instance,\u201d O\u2019Hara says of Mozilla\u2019s plans to heavily moderate its space.

{"title":"How ego and fear fuelled the rise of artificial intelligence","context":"## How ego and fear fuelled the rise of artificial intelligence\n\nBut eight years later, the argument between the two men seems prescient. The question of whether AI will elevate the world or destroy it \u2013 or at least inflict grave damage \u2013 has framed an ongoing debate among Silicon Valley founders, chatbot users, academics, legislators and regulators about whether the technology should be controlled or set free. Loading That debate has pitted some of the world\u2019s richest men against one another: Musk, Page, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, tech investor Peter Thiel, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sam Altman of OpenAI. All have fought for a piece of the business \u2013 which one day could be worth trillions of dollars \u2013 and the power to shape it. At the heart of this competition is a brain-stretching paradox. The people who say they are most worried about AI are among the most determined to create it and enjoy its riches. They have justified their ambition with their strong belief that they alone can keep AI from endangering Earth. Musk and Page stopped speaking soon after the party that summer. A few weeks later, Musk dined with Altman, who was then running a tech incubator, and several researchers in a private room at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park, California, a favoured deal-making spot close to the venture capital offices of Sand Hill Road.\nThat dinner led to the creation of a startup called OpenAI later in the year. Backed by hundreds of millions of dollars from Musk and other funders, the lab promised to protect the world from Page\u2019s vision. Thanks to its ChatGPT chatbot, OpenAI has fundamentally changed the technology industry and has introduced the world to the risks and potential of artificial intelligence. OpenAI is valued at more than $US80 billion ($A123 billion), according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s latest funding round, although Musk and Altman\u2019s partnership didn\u2019t make it. The two have since stopped speaking. Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Credit: Bloomberg, AP \u201cThere is disagreement, mistrust, egos,\u201d Altman said. \u201cThe closer people are to being pointed in the same direction, the more contentious the disagreements are. You see this in sects and religious orders. There are bitter fights between the closest people.\u201d Last month that infighting came to OpenAI\u2019s boardroom. Rebel board members tried to force out Altman because, they believed, they could no longer trust him to build AI that would benefit humanity. Over five chaotic days, OpenAI looked as if it were going to fall apart, until the board \u2013 pressured by giant investors and employees who threatened to follow Altman out the door \u2013 backed down.\nThe drama inside OpenAI gave the world its first glimpse of the bitter feuds among those who will determine the future of AI. But years before OpenAI\u2019s near meltdown, there was a little-publicised but ferocious competition in Silicon Valley for control of the technology that is now quickly reshaping the world, from how children are taught to how wars are fought. The birth of DeepMind Five years before the Napa Valley party and two before the cat breakthrough on YouTube, Demis Hassabis, a 34-year-old neuroscientist, walked into a cocktail party at Thiel\u2019s San Francisco town house and realised he had hit pay dirt. There in Thiel\u2019s living room, overlooking the city\u2019s Palace of Fine Arts and a swan pond, was a chessboard. Hassabis had once been the second-best player in the world in the under-14 category. \u201cI was preparing for that meeting for a year,\u201d Hassabis said. \u201cI thought that would be my unique hook in: I knew that he loved chess.\u201d\nIn 2010, Hassabis and two colleagues, who all lived in Britain, were looking for money to start building \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d or AGI, a machine that could do anything the brain could do. At the time, few people were interested in AI. After a half-century of research, the AI field had failed to deliver anything remotely close to the human brain. Demis Hassabis at the UK\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Safety Summit, at Bletchley Park last month. Credit: Reuters Pool Still, some scientists and thinkers had become fixated on the downsides of AI. Many, including the three young men from Britain, had a connection to Eliezer Yudkowsky, an internet philosopher and self-taught AI researcher. Yudkowsky was a leader in a community of people who called themselves Rationalists or, in later years, effective altruists. They believed that AI could find a cure for cancer or solve climate change, but they worried that AI bots might do things their creators had not intended. If the machines became more intelligent than humans, the Rationalists argued, the machines could turn on their creators. Thiel had become enormously wealthy through an early investment in Facebook and through his work with Musk in the early days of PayPal. He had developed a fascination with the singularity, a trope of science fiction that describes the moment when intelligent technology can no longer be controlled by humanity.\nWith funding from Thiel, Yudkowsky had expanded his AI lab and created an annual conference on the singularity. Years before, one of Hassabis\u2019 two colleagues had met Yudkowsky, and he snagged them speaking spots at the conference, ensuring they\u2019d be invited to Thiel\u2019s party. Yudkowsky introduced Hassabis to Thiel. Hassabis assumed that lots of people at the party would be trying to squeeze their host for money. His strategy was to arrange another meeting. There was a deep tension between the bishop and the knight, he told Thiel. The two pieces carried the same value, but the best players understood that their strengths were vastly different. It worked. Charmed, Thiel invited the group back the next day, where they gathered in the kitchen. Their host had just finished his morning workout and was still sweating in a shiny tracksuit. A butler handed him a Diet Coke. The three made their pitch, and soon Thiel and his venture capital firm agreed to put \u00a31.4 million ($A2.7 million) into their startup. He was their first major investor.\nThey named their company DeepMind, a nod to \u201cdeep learning,\u201d a way for AI systems to learn skills by analysing large amounts of data; to neuroscience; and to the Deep Thought supercomputer from the sci-fi novel The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. By the spring of 2010, they were building their dream machine. They wholeheartedly believed that because they understood the risks, they were uniquely positioned to protect the world. \u201cI don\u2019t see this as a contradictory position,\u201d said Mustafa Suleyman, one of the three DeepMind founders. \u201cThere are huge benefits to come from these technologies. The goal is not to eliminate them or pause their development. The goal is to mitigate the downsides.\u201d Loading Having won over Thiel, Hassabis worked his way into Musk\u2019s orbit. About two years later, they met at a conference organised by Thiel\u2019s investment fund, which had also put money into Musk\u2019s company SpaceX. Hassabis secured a tour of SpaceX headquarters. Afterward, with rocket hulls hanging from the ceiling, the two men lunched in the cafeteria and talked. Musk explained that his plan was to colonise Mars to escape overpopulation and other dangers on Earth. Hassabis replied that the plan would work \u2013 so long as superintelligent machines didn\u2019t follow and destroy humanity on Mars, too. Musk was speechless. He hadn\u2019t thought about that particular danger. Musk soon invested in DeepMind alongside Thiel, so he could be closer to the creation of this technology.\nFlush with cash, DeepMind hired researchers who specialised in neural networks, complex algorithms created in the image of the human brain. A neural network is essentially a giant mathematical system that spends days, weeks or even months identifying patterns in large amounts of digital data. First developed in the 1950s, these systems could learn to handle tasks on their own. After analysing names and addresses scribbled on hundreds of envelopes, for instance, they could read handwritten text. DeepMind took the concept further. It built a system that could learn to play classic Atari games such as Space Invaders, Pong and Breakout to illustrate what was possible. This got the attention of another Silicon Valley powerhouse, Google, and specifically Page. He saw a demonstration of DeepMind\u2019s machine playing Atari games. He wanted in. The talent auction In the spring of 2012, Geoffrey Hinton, a 64-year-old professor at the University of Toronto, and two graduate students published a research paper that showed the world what AI could do. They trained a neural network to recognise common objects such as flowers, dogs and cars.\nScientists were surprised by the accuracy of the technology built by Hinton and his students. One who took particular notice was Yu Kai, an AI researcher who had met Hinton at a research conference and had recently started working for Baidu, a giant Chinese internet company. Baidu offered Hinton and his students $US12 million to join the company in Beijing, according to three people familiar with the offer. Hinton turned Baidu down, but the money got his attention. The Cambridge-educated British expatriate had spent most of his career in academia, except for occasional stints at Microsoft and Google, and was not especially driven by money. But he had a neurodivergent child, and the money would mean financial security. \u201cWe did not know how much we were worth,\u201d Hinton said. He consulted lawyers and experts on acquisitions and came up with a plan: \u201cWe would organise an auction, and we would sell ourselves.\u201d The auction would take place during an annual AI conference at the Harrah\u2019s hotel and casino on Lake Tahoe. Big Tech took notice.\nGoogle, Microsoft, Baidu and other companies were beginning to believe that neural networks were a path to machines that could not only see but also hear, write, talk and \u2014 eventually \u2014 think. Loading Page had seen similar technology at Google Brain, his company\u2019s AI lab, and he thought Hinton\u2019s research could elevate his scientists\u2019 work. He gave Alan Eustace, Google\u2019s senior vice president of engineering, what amounted to a blank check to hire any AI expertise he needed. Eustace and Jeff Dean, who led the Brain lab, flew to Lake Tahoe and took Hinton and his students out to dinner at a steakhouse inside the hotel the night before the auction. The smell of old cigarettes was overpowering, Dean recalled. They made the case for coming to work at Google. The next day, Hinton ran the auction from his hotel room. Because of an old back injury, he rarely sat down. He turned a trash can upside down on a table, put his laptop on top and watched the bids roll in over the next two days.\nGoogle made an offer. So did Microsoft. DeepMind quickly bowed out as the price went up. The industry giants pushed the bids to $US20 million and then $US25 million, according to documents detailing the auction. As the price passed $US30 million, Microsoft quit, but it rejoined the bidding at $US37 million. \u201cWe felt like we were in a movie,\u201d Hinton said. Then Microsoft dropped out a second time. Only Baidu and Google were left, and they pushed the bidding to $US42 million, $US43 million. Finally, at $US44 million, Hinton and his students stopped the auction. The bids were still climbing, but they wanted to work for Google. And the money was staggering. It was an unmistakable sign that deep-pocketed companies were determined to buy the most talented AI researchers, which was not lost on Hassabis at DeepMind. He had always told his employees that DeepMind would remain an independent company. That was, he believed, the best way to ensure its technology didn\u2019t turn into something dangerous. But as Big Tech entered the talent race, he decided he had no choice: It was time to sell. By the end of 2012, Google and Facebook were angling to acquire the London lab, according to three people familiar with the matter. Hassabis and his co-founders insisted on two conditions: No DeepMind technology could be used for military purposes, and its AGI technology must be overseen by an independent board of technologists and ethicists.\nGoogle offered $US650 million. Zuckerberg of Facebook offered a bigger payout to DeepMind\u2019s founders but would not agree to the conditions. DeepMind sold to Google. Zuckerberg was determined to build an AI lab of his own. He hired Yann LeCun, a French computer scientist who had also done pioneering AI research, to run it. A year after Hinton\u2019s auction, Zuckerberg and LeCun flew to Lake Tahoe for the same AI conference. While padding around a suite at the Harrah\u2019s casino in his socks, Zuckerberg personally interviewed top researchers, who were soon offered millions of dollars in salary and stock. AI was once laughed off. Now the richest men in Silicon Valley were shelling out billions to keep from being left behind. The lost ethics board\nWhen Musk invested in DeepMind, he broke his own informal rule \u2013 that he would not invest in any company he didn\u2019t run himself. The downsides of his decision were already apparent when, only a month or so after his birthday spat with Page, he again found himself face to face with his former friend and fellow billionaire. Larry Page, co-founder of Google. Credit: Bloomberg The occasion was the first meeting of DeepMind\u2019s ethics board, on August 14, 2015. The board had been set up at the insistence of the startup\u2019s founders to ensure that their technology did no harm after the sale. The members convened in a conference room just outside Musk\u2019s office at SpaceX. But that\u2019s where Musk\u2019s control ended. When Google bought DeepMind, it bought the whole thing. Musk was out. Financially, he had come out ahead, but he was unhappy. Three Google executives now firmly in control of DeepMind were there: Page; Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder and Tesla investor; and Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s chair. Among the other attendees were Reid Hoffman, another PayPal founder; and Toby Ord, an Australian philosopher studying \u201cexistential risk\u201d.\nThe DeepMind founders reported that they were pushing ahead with their work but that they were aware the technology carried serious risks. Suleyman, the DeepMind co-founder, gave a presentation called \u201cThe Pitchforkers Are Coming.\u201d AI could lead to an explosion in disinformation, he told the board. He fretted that as the technology replaced countless jobs in the coming years, the public would accuse Google of stealing their livelihoods. Google would need to share its wealth with the millions who could no longer find work and provide a \u201cuniversal basic income,\u201d he argued. Musk agreed. But it was pretty clear that his Google guests were not prepared to embark on a redistribution of (their) wealth. Schmidt said he thought the worries were completely overblown. In his usual whisper, Page agreed. AI would create more jobs than it took away, he argued. Eight months later, DeepMind had a breakthrough that stunned the AI community and the world. A DeepMind machine called AlphaGo beat one of the world\u2019s best players at the ancient game of Go. The game, streamed over the internet, was watched by 200 million people across the globe. Most researchers had assumed that AI needed another 10 years to muster the ingenuity to do that. Demis Hassabis, right, co-founder of DeepMind, with South Korean professional Lee Se-dol. Lee played Go against the DeepMind machine AlphaGo in March 2016. Credit: EPA\nRationalists, effective altruists and others who worried about the risks of AI claimed the computer\u2019s win validated their fears. \u201cThis is another indication that AI is progressing faster than even many experts anticipated,\u201d Victoria Krakovna, who would soon join DeepMind as an \u201cAI safety\u201d researcher, wrote in a blog post. DeepMind\u2019s founders were increasingly worried about what Google would do with their inventions. In 2017, they tried to break away from the company. Google responded by increasing the salaries and stock award packages of the DeepMind founders and their staff. They stayed put. The ethics board never had a second meeting. The Breakup\nConvinced that Page\u2019s optimistic view of AI was dead wrong, and angry at his loss of DeepMind, Musk built his own lab. OpenAI was founded in late 2015, just a few months after he met with Altman at the Rosewood hotel in Silicon Valley. Sam Altman Credit: Bloomberg Businessweek Musk pumped money into the lab, and his former PayPal buddies \u2013 Hoffman and Thiel \u2013 came along for the ride. The three men and others pledged to put $US1 billion into the project, which Altman, who was 30 at the time, would help run. To get them started, they poached Ilya Sutskever from Google. (Sutskever was one of the graduate students Google \u201cbought\u201d in Hinton\u2019s auction.) Initially, Musk wanted to operate OpenAI as a nonprofit, free from the economic incentives that were driving Google and other corporations. But by the time Google wowed the tech community with its Go stunt, Musk was changing his mind about how it should be run. He desperately wanted OpenAI to invent something that would capture the world\u2019s imagination and close the gap with Google, but it wasn\u2019t getting the job done as a nonprofit.\nIn late 2017, Musk hatched a plan to wrest control of the lab from Altman and the other founders and transform it into a commercial operation that would join forces with Tesla and rely on supercomputers the car company was developing, according to four people familiar with the matter. When Altman and others pushed back, Musk quit and said he would focus on his own AI work at Tesla. In February 2018, he announced his departure to OpenAI\u2019s staff on the top floor of the startup\u2019s offices in a converted truck factory, three people who attended the meeting said. When he said that OpenAI needed to move faster, one researcher retorted at the meeting that Musk was being reckless. Musk called the researcher a \u201cjackass\u201d and stormed out, taking his deep pockets with him. OpenAI suddenly needed new financing in a hurry. Altman flew to Sun Valley for a conference and ran into Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s CEO. A tie-up seemed natural. Altman knew Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer, Kevin Scott. Microsoft had bought LinkedIn from Hoffman, an OpenAI board member. Nadella told Scott to get it done. The deal closed in 2019. Altman and OpenAI had formed a for-profit company under the original nonprofit, they had $US1 billion in fresh capital, and Microsoft had a new way to build AI into its vast cloud computing service. Not everyone inside OpenAI was happy.\nDario Amodei, a researcher with ties to the effective altruist community, had been on hand at the Rosewood hotel when OpenAI was born. Amodei, who endlessly twisted his curls between his fingers as he talked, was leading the lab\u2019s efforts to build a neural network called a large language model that could learn from enormous amounts of digital text. Seeking the path to artificial general intelligence, AGI. Credit: iStock By analysing countless Wikipedia articles, digital books and message boards, it could generate text on its own. It also had the unfortunate habit of making things up. It was called GPT-3, and it was released in the summer of 2020. Researchers inside OpenAI, Google and other companies thought this rapidly improving technology could be a path to AGI. But Amodei was unhappy about the Microsoft deal because he thought it was taking OpenAI in a really commercial direction. He and other researchers went to the board to try to push Altman out, according to five people familiar with the matter. After they failed, they left. Like DeepMind\u2019s founders before them, they worried that their new corporate overlords would favour commercial interests over safety.\nIn 2021, the group of about 15 engineers and scientists created a new lab called Anthropic. The plan was to build AI the way the effective altruists thought it should done \u2013 with very tight controls. \u201cThere was no attempt to remove Sam Altman from OpenAI by the co-founders of Anthropic,\u201d said an Anthropic spokesperson, Sally Aldous. \u201cThe co-founders themselves came to the conclusion that they wished to depart OpenAI to start their own company, made this known to OpenAI\u2019s leadership, and over several weeks negotiated an exit on mutually agreeable terms.\u201d Anthropic accepted a $US4 billion investment from Amazon and another $US2 billion from Google two years later. The Reveal After OpenAI received another $US2 billion from Microsoft, Altman and another senior executive, Greg Brockman, visited Bill Gates at his sprawling mansion on the shores of Lake Washington, outside Seattle. The Microsoft founder was no longer involved in the company day to day but kept in regular touch with its executives.\nOver dinner, Gates told them he doubted that large language models could work. He would stay sceptical, he said, until the technology performed a task that required critical thinking \u2013 passing an Advanced Placement biology test, for instance. Five months later, on August 24, 2022, Altman and Brockman returned and brought along an OpenAI researcher named Chelsea Voss. Voss had been a medallist in an international biology Olympiad as a high schooler. Nadella and other Microsoft executives were there, too. On a huge digital display on a stand outside Gates\u2019 living room, the OpenAI crew presented a technology called GPT-4. Brockman gave the system a multiple-choice advanced biology test, and Voss graded the answers. Bill Gates believes AI will eventually change the nature of work. Credit: Peter Morris\/Sydney Heads The first question involved polar molecules, groups of atoms with a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other. The system answered correctly and explained its choice. \u201cIt was only trained to provide an answer,\u201d Brockman said. \u201cThe conversational nature kind of fell out, almost magically.\u201d In other words, it was doing things they hadn\u2019t really designed it to do.\n\nThis article, authored by Cade Metz, Karen Weise, Nico Grant and Mike Isaac, was published by The Age on 2023-12-09 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":27}

Shares in Endeavour lifted 2.4 per cent after it forecast earnings before interest and tax in its hotels division would grow by more than $150 million over the next five years. The laggards Utilities and energy stocks were the weakest performers on the local bourse, rising 0.6 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively.\nOnly five large-cap stocks declined, with Evolution Mining sinking a mammoth 13 per cent after it raised $525 million selling new shares to institutional investors at $3.80 a share. The mining sector, however, managed to finish in positive territory. Gold miner Newmont was down 1.25 per cent, Origin Energy fell 0.4 per cent, Mercury Nz declined 0.3 per cent and Argo Investments traded 0.1 per cent lower. The lowdown Moomoo market strategist Jessica Amir said the local sharemarket outperformed global equities on Wednesday because of the National Accounts figures, which pointed to the Reserve Bank potentially hitting pause on lifting interest rates. \u201cWe know economic growth is slowing, Australian unemployment is likely to pick up next year and inflation is likely to fall,\u201d Amir said. \u201cThe good news is that all of these three things, the trifecta, is pointing towards the RBA stopping rising interest rates and then potentially moving to cut interest rates. This is what the market has priced in today.\u201d\nThe local gains came after most stocks slipped on Wall Street overnight, although the US market stayed near its highest level in 20 months following a mixed set of reports that kept alive questions about whether the world\u2019s largest economy can pull off a perfect landing where it kills high inflation, but avoids a recession. The S&P 500 edged down by 0.1 per cent for its first back-to-back loss since October. The Dow Jones slipped 0.2 per cent and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3 per cent. Stocks were down more sharply in Asia amid worries about the health of China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second largest. US stocks and Treasury yields wavered after reports showed that US employers advertised far fewer jobs at the end of October than expected, while growth for services businesses accelerated more last month than expected. Hope has been rising on Wall Street recently that the US economy is slowing from its recent hot pace by just the right amount. Too much strength would give inflation more fuel, but too little would mean a recession.\nWith inflation down from its peak two summers ago, Wall Street is hopeful that the Federal Reserve may finally be done with its market-shaking hikes to interest rates and could soon turn to cutting them. That could help the economy avoid a recession and give a boost to all kinds of investment prices. Investors have been looking for a slowdown in the job market in particular. The hope is that it can cool more through employers cutting back on open positions than on employers laying off workers. Tuesday\u2019s report showed that employers advertised just 8.7 million jobs on the last day of October, down by 617,000 from a month earlier. In the bond market, US Treasury yields continued to sag further from the heights they reached during late October. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.18 per cent from 4.26 per cent late on Monday, offering more breathing space for stocks and other markets. It had been above 5 per cent, and at its highest level in more than a decade, during October. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, went on a jagged run following the economic reports. It fell from 4.61 per cent just before the reports\u2019 release to 4.57 per cent and then yo-yoed before easing back to 4.57 per cent.\nLoading Traders widely expect the Federal Reserve to hold its key interest rate steady at its meeting next week, before potentially cutting rates in March, according to data from CME Group. Fed officials have recently hinted that the federal funds rate may indeed already be at its peak. It\u2019s above 5.25 per cent, up from nearly zero early last year. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell and others have also warned Wall Street about being overzealous in its predictions about how early a cut could happen. Lower yields have been one reason prices for cryptocurrencies have been rising recently. Excitement about a possible exchange-traded fund tied to bitcoin, which would open it to new kinds of investors, has also helped send it above $US43,000 ($65,600) recently. The surge of interest helped Robinhood Markets report a roughly 75 per cent jump in trading volumes for crypto during November from a month earlier. It also said customers added about $US1.4 billion in net deposits during the month, and its own stock rose 10.3 per cent.\nOn the losing end of Wall Street was Take-Two Interactive, which slipped 0.5 per cent after a trailer for its highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI video game said it\u2019s coming in 2025.

Stocks have struggled under the weight of soaring Treasury yields in the bond market. High yields undercut stock prices by pulling investment dollars away from stocks and into bonds. They also crimp corporate profits by making borrowing more expensive.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is the centrepiece of the bond market, pulled back from its highest level since 2007, down to 4.73 per cent from 4.80 per cent late on Tuesday. Shorter- and longer-term yields also eased to allow more oxygen for the stock market. Yields fell following a couple of reports indicating a slowing US economy. The first suggested hiring by employers outside the government was much weaker last month than expected. On Wall Street, that\u2019s currently good news because a cooling job market could mean less upward pressure on inflation. That in turn could convince the Federal Reserve to take it easier on interest rates. After already raising its main interest rate to the highest level since 2001, the Fed has indicated it may keep its overnight rate higher next year than it had earlier expected. Treasury yields have correspondingly snapped higher as traders accept a new normal for markets of high rates for longer. The Fed is paying particular attention to the job market because too much strength there could drive wages for workers much higher, which it fears could keep inflation well above its target of 2 per cent.\nOil prices slumped overnight. Credit: AP Wednesday\u2019s report from ADP suggested private employers added 89,000 jobs last month, a much sharper slowdown in hiring than the 140,000 that economists expected. The report doesn\u2019t have a perfect track record in predicting what the more comprehensive jobs report from the US government will say. That will arrive on Friday. But \u201cif Friday\u2019s report also shows the labour market is cooling, stock investors may worry a little less about indefinitely higher interest rates,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office. A second report on the economy said growth in US services industries slowed in September by a touch more than economists expected.\nIt also offered some hints of sticky pressure on inflation, with prices paid by services companies rising last month at a similar rate as in August. Oil prices tumbled on Wednesday to take some heat off inflation. Benchmark US crude fell $US5.01 to settle at $US84.22 per barrel for its worst drop in just over a year. It\u2019s been pulling back since, topping $US93 last week. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $US5.11 to $US85.81. Loading Prices for crude had been generally charging higher from $US70 during the summer, following announcements of cuts to production by some oil-producing countries. Wall Street is also absorbing the ouster of Kevin McCarthy as the speaker of the House of Representatives. The unprecedented move to remove a speaker from the position likely doesn\u2019t change much in the short term, with funding for the US government set until November 17.\n\u201cThat said, a leadership vacuum in the House raises the odds of a government shutdown when the current funding extension expires,\u201d according to economists at Goldman Sachs. A shutdown would drag on the US economy, raising the risk of a recession, though financial markets have held up relatively well through past shutdowns. On Wall Street, big tech stocks helped to support the market after leading it lower a day earlier. They tend to move more sharply with expectations for rates because high-growth stocks are seen as some of the biggest victims of high yields. In markets abroad, stock indexes were mixed across much of Europe. Tweet of the day\nQuote of the day \u201cLast year, Christmas spending was bolstered by a record freedom spending phenomenon with delayed overseas travel, whereas this year shoppers are expected to be much more conservative with their budgets,\u201d said Australian Retailers Association chief Paul Zahra as cost-of-living pressures put a lid on spending, with shoppers tipped to cut back on hospitality, home goods and clothes purchases.

{"title":"SBF, riding high on FTX, reportedly offered $5B to Trump to cancel President re-run","context":"## SBF, riding high on FTX, reportedly offered $5B to Trump to cancel President re-run\n\nCome Tuesday, our eyes will be trained on the Manhattan Federal Court for the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency entrepreneur accused of orchestrating \u201cone of the biggest financial frauds in American history\u201d: the multibillion-dollar collapse of FTX, the crypto exchange he founded and led.\nSBF, as he\u2019s known, has pleaded not-guilty to some seven charges of fraud and conspiracy. But, as we wait to hear both his version and the government\u2019s version of what happened, there will be another tale recounting how things played out: \u201cGoing Infinite,\u201d a book by Michael Lewis chronicling the rise and fall of SBF, is set to debut on the first day of the trial.\nThe episode has fired up a lot of people, indignant at what they feel was too-easy treatment for someone who many believe brought down the whole crypto house.\n60 Minutes got rightly community noted here. How is it that SBF is _still_ getting super positive media coverage when the media has nothing good to say about the founders that have actually created things and brought value into the world? https:\/\/t.co\/VPV1ORVHqf \u2014 tobi lutke (@tobi) October 2, 2023\nThe germination of \u201cGoing Infinite\u201d sounds as unlikely as the story of SBF himself.\nIn an interview broadcast yesterday on 60 Minutes, Lewis, the famed chronicler of financial adventure and misadventure \u2014 his books include \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker,\u201d \u201cMoneyball\u201d and \u201cThe Big Short\u201d \u2014 said that he didn\u2019t set out to write a book about SBF. Rather, Lewis claims he was introduced to him in early 2021 by a friend who wanted to back FTX. Before any financial commitment, that friend asked Lewis to meet the young billionaire \u2014 both lived in Berkeley \u2014 to \u201cevaluate his character.\u201d\nNo, we don\u2019t find out who that friend is, nor do we find out if that particular investment was ever made \u2014 SBF did raise some $2 billion, including $1 billion in 2021, from backers that included Sequoia, Temasek, Tiger Global and dozens more.\nBut we do find out that another investment, of sorts, was made on that day: Lewis himself was so taken with the idea of SBF and his apparent brilliance that he came away with the decision to write about him.\n\u201cEighteen months earlier, he had nothing. Now he had $22.5 billion. He was the richest person in the world under 30 [and] he was going to spend it to save humanity from extinction,\u201d he said. \u201cMy jaw was on the floor.\u201d\nThe two proceeded to meet more than 100 times over the next two years. As SBF\u2019s fame and his company\u2019s bank account grew, 60 Minutes itself even got involved. The program shot (and it shows here) one segment with SBF talking as he shuffles cards with his leg twitching nervously behind his desk (why? we don\u2019t find this out, either) as Lewis, with a flourish of his pen and a look of concentration on his face, dashes off notes on his yellow legal pad.\nLater in the show, you get other behind-the-scenes, unnerving glimpses of how the wizard operated behind the curtain. For instance, Lewis recounts how he was in the room when SBF made his first television appearance.\n\u201cIf you watch the clip, you\u2019ll see his eyes going back and forth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s trying to win his video game at the same time he\u2019s on the air.\u201d\n\u201cIf you watch the clip, you\u2019ll see his eyes going back and forth. It\u2019s because he\u2019s trying to win his video game at the same time he\u2019s on the air.\u201d Michael Lewis\nFriendships and lucrative marketing deals followed, with sports icons like Tom Brady (who was paid $55 million) and Steph Curry ($35 million) to \u201clend FTX legitimacy and edge.\u201d Even Anna Wintour, the icy fashion doyenne, was in contact: She reached out, over what must have been a hell of a Zoom meeting, to ask SBF \u2014 whose preferred get-up is\/was wildly curly hair, t-shirts and cargo shorts \u2014 to sponsor her very fancy Met Costume Ball. Desperate times!\nAs trades on FTX climbed up to $15 billion\/day, SBF, of course, also got tied up in the corridors of political power.\nLewis said that he met with the young crypto king ahead of him seeing Mitch McConnell to discuss how he could fund political candidates who were looking to offset Trump\u2019s influence in the Republican Party. We find out that the gravitational pull of cargo shorts was a tough one to pull away from: The suit SBF brought to wear to the McConnell meeting was tightly balled up under his arm with his dress shoes falling out of the middle of the bundle. We\u2019ve all been there, Sam. (Well, perhaps not Anna.)\nLewis also claimed that SBF had concocted a plan to buy off Trump, to get him not to run again for president.\n\u201cLike how much would it take to get an answer?\u201d Lewis recounted. \u201cThere was a number that was kicking around\u2026 this was $5 billion.\u201d He said that Sam was never sure whether that figure came directly from Trump. And no, we don\u2019t find out if he ever did wire anything to camp Trump. That would be a wonderful detail to get teased out in the trial, though.\nAnd lest you think Biden and the Democrats have their hands clean of SBF\u2026 think again: He also looked to back candidates on that side of the aisle. You never know when you might need a friend!\nThe hard crash\nAll of that activity, of course, came to a crashing end: The value of cryptocurrencies on FTX was not banked to much more than speculation and the promise of higher value, and so when those valuations fell, they fell very, very hard.\nWhat we already knew was that SBF has been denied bail; his name is mud (or much worse) among those who have lost money in Alameda or FTX; and those who might not have had positions in these still blame him for other crypto woes because he set off a ripple effect.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t come off good at all here. You can tell he had no experience in management or handling such big undertakings. I think he was in way over his head,\u201d Ayelet Noff, the CEO and founder of public relations firm Sliced Brand, which represents a number of cryptocurrency businesses, told TechCrunch. \u201cI think he does a disservice to the whole community. He pushed back crypto adoption by at least a year or two. Each time one of these things happens it brings back the whole market. It\u2019s two steps forward and one step back.\u201d\nThe Michael Lewis interview is infuriating. SBF was a scumbag, and now we need to hear about his \u201ctragic fall\u201d in the MSM because Sam told them he was an \u201ceffective altruist\u201d and people like Michael Lewis were so far up his ass they couldn\u2019t tell truth from fiction. \u2014 Ryan Selkis \ud83e\udeb3 (@twobitidiot) October 2, 2023\nShameful that Michael Lewis is defending SBF. \u201cThey had a great real business. If no one had cast aspersions on the business, if there hadn\u2019t been a run on customers deposits, they\u2019d still be making tons of money\u201d \u2013 Michael Lewis That's not true. They are not a bank, they're\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/vRKBbgzITe \u2014 Dan Held (@danheld) October 2, 2023\nBut even so, Noff is defensive: She also believes crypto is no worse than the stock market, which can also be manipulated and mishandled.\n\u201cEven when you identify corruption, I don\u2019t think that means we don\u2019t believe in the system in question,\u201d she added.\nYet Lewis\u2019s picture is a little less stark from the looks of the 60 Minutes episode. In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not that clear at all if SBF is getting a kicking or a coat of polish in this interview when you consider Lewis\u2019s celebration of SBF\u2019s self-proclaimed (yet not quite proven) idealism, and the \u201cBankman-Fried-shaped hold in the world\u201d that exists.\nYou could say that confused message is very apt for cryptocurrency, where the process by which it works is forever murky and often misrepresented, at least to most people.\nIf SBF didn\u2019t intentionally aim to cynically defraud a bunch of people, in the long run he became one of the many who disastrously failed to manage the risk inherent in crypto speculation. That\u2019s ultimately what happened with FTX, as financial discrepancies racked up between the exchange and its sister company Alameda Research (a trader itself on the platform). The failure is indisputable: The jury will now have to decide how criminal, and how far, his intentions were around that.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-02 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":30}
{"title":"Is Sam Bankman-Fried a bad \u2018man\u2019 or a good \u2018boy\u2019? Lawyers swap opening statements before first witnesses take the stand","context":"## Is Sam Bankman-Fried a bad \u2018man\u2019 or a good \u2018boy\u2019? Lawyers swap opening statements before first witnesses take the stand\n\nWho is Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of crypto exchange FTX? Is he a liar and a fraud? Or did he act in good faith, and like many a startup founder, fly too close to the sun?\nThat answer ultimately lies with the jury, which was selected on Wednesday morning before lawyers for the government and then Bankman-Fried swapped two very different stories of the former crypto mogul\u2019s sudden rise and almost instantaneous fall.\nHere\u2019s what happened on the second day of the trial, which featured pointed allegations, a friend from MIT, and an audience replete with big names, including Bankman-Fried\u2019s professorial parents and Damian Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\nA conscious criminal\u2026\nThe prosecution\u2019s account of the alleged crimes by Bankman-Fried, who spent most of his day in court staring into a laptop while seated between his two attorneys, featured a study in contrasts.\n\u201cOne year ago, it looked like the defendant was on the top of the world,\u201d began Thane Rehn, a prosecutor for the government, in his opening statement. The former CEO of FTX oversaw a supposedly thriving crypto exchange, jetted between international locales, and hobnobbed with celebrities like Tom Brady and Larry David. He repeatedly emphasized to customers that their money was safe and secure.\nBut \u201call of that, all of it, was built on lies,\u201d Rehn declared to the jury. \u201cBehind the curtains, he was not what he appeared to be.\u201d What followed was a roughly 30-minute story that repeatedly emphasized how Bankman-Fried allegedly stole customer funds to facilitate his jet-setting lifestyle, donate millions to political candidates, and finance risky bets.\nThe key to his alleged scheme? Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund he also owned, argued Rehn. Using Caroline Ellison, his on-again off-again girlfriend and the CEO of Alameda, as a front, Bankman-Fried had \u201csecret access\u201d to customer money\u2014both cash and crypto\u2014the government claimed.\nMoreover, Bankman-Fried allegedly directed employees to conceal the flow of money into FTX\u2019s coffers and forged financial documents distributed to lenders and investors. \u201cThe defendant lied to the world,\u201d Rehn alleged.\nAnd who was this defendant? Not a crypto \u201cboy\u201d genius, as so many in the media (Fortune included) have written, but a \u201cman\u201d who \u201cstole billions of dollars from thousands of victims,\u201d Rehn said. \u201cYou will see the full picture.\u201d\n\u2026or a well-meaning founder?\nBut Bankman-Fried, whose cheekbones were more prominent after spending about seven weeks in a Brooklyn prison, was no liar, according to Mark Cohen, one of his lawyers. \u201cSam didn\u2019t defraud anyone,\u201d he said early on in his opening statement.\nWhat the jury will see is a nerdy startup founder who acted in \u201cgood faith,\u201d not the prosecution\u2019s \u201ccartoon of a villain.\u201d (Cohen repeatedly harped on Bankman-Fried\u2019s allegedly good-faith actions throughout his address to the jury.)\nAlameda was not subterranean or shady. It was a successful hedge fund, he said. FTX was no Ponzi scheme. It was a \u201cvery innovative, successful company.\u201d And the business practices between the two were reasonable, he argued, claiming that Alameda acted legally as an FTX customer, payment processor, and market maker, or financial entity that acts as a trading partner for customers looking to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\nIn an analogy he employed throughout his opening statement, he said that \u201cworking at a startup is like building a plane as you\u2019re flying it\u201d and that businesses sometimes fail. In fact, he specifically pointed the finger at Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda, who, he said, did not adequately protect her hedge fund from the inherent risk of the crypto markets.\nWhen the walls came closing in and the aforementioned plane approached the \u201ceye of the storm,\u201d Bankman-Fried did not act like someone who was guilty. Rather, he was willing to give up his personal wealth to make customers whole, Cohen argued.\n\u201cIn the end, Sam started and built two billion-dollar businesses,\u201d he concluded. \u201cHe didn\u2019t steal any money.\u201d\nA Frenchman who lives in London testifies in New York\nAfter lawyers from both sides depicted two very different Bankman-Frieds, the prosecution called its first two witnesses to the stand\u2014and they weren\u2019t blockbuster names or former lieutenants-turned-government-cooperators, like Ellison.\nThe first was a victim: Marc-Antoine Julliard, a Paris-born cocoa trader who lives in London. In 2021, Julliard, who had coiffed hair and spoke with a strong French accent, decided to invest in crypto and landed on FTX as his exchange of choice, where he traded cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.\nOn Nov. 8, in the crypto exchange\u2019s final few days, he tried to pull out his cash and crypto. How much? Almost $100,000, he said. And was he ever able to? \u201cNever,\u201d he told prosecutors.\nShortly afterward, as the trial neared late afternoon, the government called Adam Yedidia to the stand. A fast-talking graduate of MIT, he and Bankman-Fried were close friends in college, he said. And after Bankman-Fried left Jane Street, the high-frequency trading firm where the former billionaire got his start in finance after MIT, he persuaded Yedidia to join him as a trader at Alameda and then as a developer at FTX.\nWhen Yedidia first took the stand, Danielle Sassoon, one of the lead prosecutors, said that the college friend of Bankman-Fried had legal immunity during his testimony. Why did he make such a deal with the government, she asked.\n\u201cI was concerned that I had unwittingly written code that contributed to a crime,\u201d he said.\nSoon, however, the clock neared 4:30 p.m., and court adjourned for the day. Yedidia will continue his testimony on Thursday, followed by Matt Huang, a former partner at the high-powered venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and then Gary Wang, a key Bankman-Fried lieutenant and one of the government\u2019s star witnesses.\n\nThis article, authored by Ben Weiss, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-04 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":31}
{"title":"Is Google Search better than the rest? And is that fair?","context":"## Is Google Search better than the rest? And is that fair?\n\nThe process of this test did remind me how much data Google collects \u2014 not just my searches but anything I say to a smart speaker, any search result or ad that I click \u2014 which will be a point in favour of DuckDuckGo for some, even if it didn\u2019t perform as well and is harder to read. The data collection does also mean that Google (not just search but also mobile widgets and other services) personalises to me more effectively. Loading Bing has overhauled its layout over the past year to be very graphic and augmented by generative AI explanations from its chatbot. I like the idea of being able to ask follow-up questions in searches this way, but in practice it\u2019s not really there yet. In a search for \u201ckids BMX bike green\u201d (Google did pretty well and DuckDuckGo ignored the green part), Bing Chat offered a comparison of a few different options but they were too expensive. I asked, \u201cany under $200?\u201d and it replied with more options that were all over $300. Another observation from this test is that I tend to use the Google Search bar as much for returning to familiar sites as I do for searching for information, which means switching to another provider could be temporarily annoying simply because it wouldn\u2019t remember all the places I\u2019ve been. Is Google as the default unfair?\nIn a response to the trial on Google\u2019s blog, president of global affairs Kent Walker said the company\u2019s search product was the favourite of users, browsers and device makers simply because it was the best in the business. And being default was not determinative, he said; changing from Google Search to any other search provider was easy, and the company competes with many others on phones and PCs. \u201cPeople don\u2019t use Google because they have to, they use it because they want to,\u201d he said. \u201cThis lawsuit simply ignores how intensely competitive and dynamic the technology industry is today.\u201d Walker also points out that, when faced with a situation where Google is not the default, users tend to spend some effort putting Google back in charge. When Mozilla made Yahoo! the default on Firefox, most users changed it to Google. And when people set up a Windows device for the first time they frequently sidestep the Microsoft default \u2014 \u201cGoogle\u201d was the number one search query on Bing in 2021 \u2014 despite Microsoft making that very annoying to do. This is a compelling point, and many of us will be well accustomed to dodging all of Microsoft\u2019s pleading while trying to get Chrome and Google set as defaults whenever we set up a new PC. But all of these arguments do ignore the fact that Google and its competitors are not on an even playing field. The question remains, why do users prefer Google? And if the answer, as Walker says, is that Google is simply better, the question becomes whether that\u2019s down to its scale, its longevity, its ubiquity and all the user data it sucks up, which no other company could possibly match.\nFor the US, which has to prove that Google somehow broke the law to achieve the status quo, this legal case could be an uphill battle. But for the rest of us, it offers a rare opportunity for some insight into what the tech giant does with its enormous market share. Is it still focused on being the best? Or, as has been alleged, does it use its ubiquity to squeeze us for money even at the expense of product quality? How \u2018organic\u2019 are Google\u2019s results? This month, Wired posted an opinion article by lawyer and privacy advocate Megan Gray, which alleged that Google had accidentally revealed during the trial that it manipulates people\u2019s search queries for maximum ad revenue. The example given was replacing a search for \u201cchildren\u2019s clothing\u201d with \u201cNIKOLAI-brand kidswear\u201d. Loading Google rejected this in very strong terms, saying the piece was misleading and inaccurate while denying ever altering search terms. Wired removed the article for not meeting its standards, but the degree to which it was shared on social media and boosted in write-ups at other outlets shows just how willing people are to accept foul play on Google\u2019s part. A suspicion of privacy invasion and inappropriate data handling follows the company at all times.\nGrey herself is a former vice-president at DuckDuckGo, a privacy-focused company founded explicitly to counter giants such as Google. She admits that she may have misinterpreted the evidence, but maintains that Google manipulates Search to maximise ad revenue. So what does Google say? In a post on X, Google\u2019s official search liaison, Danny Sullivan, said ad systems do not affect the organic results, i.e. the list of blue links in search results that are not sponsored. \u201cAd keyword matching is a long-standing and well-known process that is designed to connect people to relevant ads. A separate process, which has nothing to do with ads, is used to match organic results to a query,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Google Search looks beyond the specific words in a query to better understand their meaning ... If you make a spelling mistake, or search for a term that\u2019s not on a page but where the page has a close synonym, or if you aren\u2019t even sure exactly how to search for something, our meaning matching systems help.\u201d It is true that some search queries result in more ads than others, and what ads you get can vary wildly depending on your request, which is the result of the keyword matching Google uses to sell ads. But Google denies pushing users towards the most monetisable subjects.\nSimilarly, it\u2019s also pretty common to see people complaining on the internet with some variation of \u201cGoogle Search was a lot better 10 years ago\u201d, which could absolutely be true. But it would be a stretch to assume that\u2019s because of the company\u2019s monetisation practices, when there\u2019s a much simpler explanation. In 2013, people were creating around 9 ZB of data every year (that\u2019s nine zettabytes, or nine trillion gigabytes), which Google had to index constantly, whereas in 2023 it\u2019s more like 120 ZB. And not a whole lot of that is static websites like it was a decade ago, it\u2019s live information that may be nested within various services and apps. What really happens when we search? Google has published extensive information about its Search procedures, so it\u2019s not difficult to get its own take on what happens in the background when you send off a query.\nGoogle\u2019s software is constantly crawling the web and updating its central index, which itself is more than 100 million gigabytes in size. When you enter a query, Search uses a few quick processes to decide the meaning of your question, including what kind of information you might be after. Then, beyond just looking for sites with the words you typed in, the system uses machine learning to rank results according to what it thinks you\u2019re looking for, prioritising high quality and easy to use sites. If you allow it, Google does bring in some information it knows about you to further refine results, including your location and web history. If you\u2019re looking to turn this off, it\u2019s in your Google account settings called \u201cWeb & App Activity\u201d. Google says it does not infer personal information like race or religion to shape results. Loading Google works with independent \u201csearch quality raters\u201d to gauge the effectiveness of its processes, and says it ran almost 900,000 quality tests in 2022. Some critics, including Megan Grey, contend that Google uses semantic keyword matching to make searches less precise on purpose, which widens the pool of content served and increases auctions for its ads. The quality tests, then, would ensure that the systems were still returning results that were justifiably related to the input.\n\nThis article, authored by Tim Biggs, was published by The Age on 2023-10-22 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":32}
{"title":"News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line","context":"## News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\n\nA new class action lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court in D.C. accuses Google and parent company Alphabet of anticompetitive behavior in violation of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and others, on behalf of news publishers. The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \u201csiphons off\u201d news publishers\u2019 content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\nIn the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is \u201cstarving the free press\u201d by sharing publishers\u2019 content on Google, losing them \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d\nIn addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google\u2019s older question-and-answer technologies, like the \u201cKnowledge Graph\u201d launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.\n\u201cWhen a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a \u2018Knowledge Panel\u2019 to the right of the search results. This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cGoogle compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers\u2019 websites \u2014 what Google calls \u2018materials shared across the web\u2019 \u2014and from \u2018open source and licensed databases,'\u201d it says.\nBy 2020, the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities. But much of the \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d that Google tapped into was content \u201cmisappropriated from Publishers,\u201d the complaint alleges.\nOther Google technologies, like \u201cFeatured Snippets\u201d where Google algorithmically extracts answers from webpages, were also cited as shifting traffic away from publishers\u2019 websites.\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the suit\u2019s tackling of how AI will impact publishers\u2019 businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\nSome publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem. For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training. But overall, publishers believe they\u2019ll lose somewhere between 20-40% of their website traffic when Google\u2019s AI products fully roll out, The WSJ\u2019s report noted.\nThe lawsuit reiterates this concern, claiming that Google\u2019s recent advances in AI-based search were implemented with \u201cthe goal of discouraging end-users from visiting the websites of Class members who are part of the digital news and publishing line of commerce.\u201d\nSGE, it argues, offers web searchers a way to seek information in a conversational mode, but ultimately keeps users in Google\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d as it \u201cplagiarizes\u201d their content. Publishers also can\u2019t block SGE because it uses the same web crawler as Google\u2019s general search service, GoogleBot.\nPlus, it says Google\u2019s Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included \u201cnews, magazine and digital publications,\u201d citing both a 2023 report from the News Media Alliance and a Washington Post article about AI training data for reference. (The Post, which worked with researchers at the Allen Institute for AI, had found that News and Media sites were the third largest category of AI training data.)\nThe case points to other concerns, too, like changing AdSense rates and evidence of improper spoliation of evidence on Google\u2019s part, by its destruction of chat messages \u2014 an issue raised in the recent Epic Games lawsuit against Google over app store antitrust issues, which Epic won.\nIn addition to damages, the suit is asking for an injunction that would require Google to obtain consent from publishers to use their website data to train its general artificial intelligence products including Google\u2019s own and those of rivals. It also asks Google to allow publishers who opt out of SGE to still show up in Google search results, among other things.\nThe U.S. lawsuit follows an agreement Google reached last month with the Canadian government which would see the search giant paying Canadian media for use of their content. Under the terms of the deal, Google will provide $73.5 million (100 million Canadian dollars) every year to news organizations in the country, with funds distributed based on the news outlets\u2019 headcount. Negotiations with Meta are still unresolved, though Meta began blocking news in Canada in August, in light of the pressure to pay for the content under the new Canadian law.\nThe case also arrives alongside the filing of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital ad technologies, and references the 2020 Justice Department\u2019s civil antitrust suit over search and search advertising (which are different markets from digital ad technologies in the more recent suit).\n\u201cThe anticompetitive effects of Google\u2019s scheme cause profound harm to competition, to consumers, to labor, and to a democratic free press,\u201d reads an announcement posted to the website of the law firm handling the case, Hausfeld.\n\u201cPlaintiff Helena World Chronicle, LLC invokes the Sherman Act and Clayton Act to seek class-wide monetary and injunctive relief to restore and ensure competition for digital news and reference publishing and set up guardrails to preserve a free marketplace of ideas in the new era of artificial intelligence,\u201d it states.\nA Google spokesperson offered a statement on the lawsuit, saying \u201cThis lawsuit is meritless. People have many ways to access information and news content today \u2013 through publishers\u2019 websites, dedicated apps, social media platforms, print papers and more. Google links people to publishers\u2019 websites more than 24 billion times each month \u2013 at no cost to them.\u201d\nThe complaint is available below.\nHelena World Chronicle, LLC v. Google LLC and Alphabet Inc by TechCrunch on Scribd\nEditor\u2019s note: This post was updated after publication with a statement provided by Google on Friday evening.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-15 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":33}
{"title":"Chiefs vs. Packers live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Sunday Night Football' game","context":"## Chiefs vs. Packers live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Sunday Night Football' game\n\nFor 59 minutes, the story of Week 13's 'Sunday Night Football' clash was Jordan Love. The first-year starter continued to showcase his evolution as a big-game player, dicing up Kansas City's All-World defense with incredible efficiency.\nThen came the blown calls.\nThe Packers edged past the Chiefs on Sunday, beneficiaries of another Love masterpiece \u2014 an increasingly common sight in the 2023 season. But it was the game's final moments that drew the most intrigue, mostly because of their incredulous nature.\nJonathan Owens was whistled for an unnecessary roughness that never was on the game's final drive, penalized for crashing into a scrambling Patrick Mahomes on the field of play. Soon after, Marquez Valdes-Scantling was seemingly impeded by Green Bay cornerback Carrington Valentine on a streak play, an unabashed pass interference call in most circumstances. The umpires fell silent.\nIf that weren't enough, Owens then barged into Kelce's back on the final play of the game and Mahomes' Hail Mary tumbled onto the turf. And like the previous play, the contact went unrecognized by the zebras.\nIt was a sorry end to an enthralling contest. Love and Mahomes dueled like gladiators, each painting pictures atop the verdant green canvas.\nLove was the better man on the day. He completed 25-of-36 passes for 267 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. It's his fourth game with three touchdowns and no interceptions this year. That's tied for most in the league.\nMORE: Watch Chiefs vs. Packers live with Fubo (free trial)\nIt was beautiful, chaotic, messy and eye-catching. Above all else, it was cold. And although there are a number of ballads to be written about the calls that could have been, for now, the Packers won't care. They're back in the postseason race, all on the back of their lithe young hurler.\nMiss any of the game?

Set. Match. Mahomes' Hail Mary falls harmlessly to the turf, giving the Packers a much-needed win. What a game!\n11:25 p.m.: Proper make-up call by the referees there, as Valdez-Scantling was almost certainly impeded illegally while streaking down the field. Should've been a pass interference. It wasn't, though. And now, Kansas City could be on the brink of losing.\n11:22 p.m.: Whole lot of laundry left back on the field. Looked like Rashee Rice may have fumbled the rock while scampering down the field. However, he was ruled down with contact. At which point Pacheco threw a punch at Nixon, prompting an ejection. Nice...\n11:18 p.m.: Referees make a baffling unnecessary roughness call on Jonathan Owens, gifting the Chiefs an extra 20 yards. That could prove vital.\n11:14 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! And it's good! Right down the middle! What a kick by Carlson. Packers lead grows back to eight.\nPackers 27, Chiefs 19\n11:12 p.m.: Love takes a sack 10 yards behind the line-of-scrimmage, setting up a rather difficult 48-yard attempt for Carlson on fourth down. The Packers desperately need their rookie kicker to come through in the clutch.\n11:11 p.m.: Watson goes down with yet another injury. This one looked like it could be a hamstring niggle. Really unfortunate end to the game for the second-year wideout, who was enjoying one of the best games of his young career.\n10:59 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! It looked like the Chiefs were on the brink of another lengthy drive. At least until Mahomes tossed a pass toward Packers corner Keisean Nixon. The noted return man pulled down an over-the-shoulder grab to break Missourians' hearts. What a grab. What a moment!\n10:53 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Anders Carlson sinks his 40-yard attempt as Green Bay continues to set the pace. Chiefs still in striking distance, though.\nPackers 24, Chiefs 19\n10:52 p.m.: Mike Danna sends Love spiraling after frolicking into the pocket on third down. Just what the doctor ordered if you're Kansas City, who look poised to force the Packers to bring their field goal team out.\n10:50 p.m.: Malik Heath drops a defender after fielding a pass on a curl pattern. Green Bay has found a real rhythm in its latest drive.\n10:46 p.m.: Another inch-perfect throw from Love to Doubs.

And again! Loves lines one right into the path of Watson, who leaps high to rip it from the sky to add to the Packers' edge. What a showcase by Love and what a grab by Watson.\nPackers 21, Chiefs 12\n10:10 p.m.: Love places a throw perfectly between triple coverage, hitting a streaking Romeo Doubs to put Green Bay on the doorstep of the end zone once more. What a phenomenal throw by the youngster.\n10:03 p.m.: Love hits Dillon out in the front, who makes his defender miss before racing beyond the marker for a first down. The first-year starter continues to make the right play in the cold. Strong display thus far.\n9:57 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Chiefs get into the end zone finally, courtesy of a Pacheco scamper through the midway. He's unable to find the target again on the two-point conversion, however, keeping the Packers in control (just barely).\nPackers 14, Chiefs 12\n9:54 p.m.: Mahomes does it again! Delicate touch pass between the Magic Man and Kelce results in yet another first down on third-and-long. Kelce's up to 81 yards on four grabs. Kansas City is threatening to breach into the red zone.\n9:47 p.m.: Mahomes hits Kelce with a floated effort as the Chiefs open the first half with a flourish. Need more of that going forward.\nEnd of second quarter: Packers 14, Chiefs 6\n9:10 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Kansas City's explosive offense has been held in check thus far. Despite showing flashes of what they can accomplish, the Chiefs were held to another field goal in this one. Yikes...\nPackers 14. Chiefs 6\n9:00 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Green Bay's second drive of the game ends much like the first, with Love firing an arrow to Watson to add to Green Bay's early advantage.\nPackers 14, Chiefs 3\nEnd of first quarter: Packers 7, Chiefs 3\n8:50 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Harrison Butler sinks his field goal after a pair of sacks relegate Kansas City to bringing its special teams onto the field.\nPackers 7, Chiefs 3\n8:48 p.m.: Isiah Pacheco gallops on the outside to grab a heap of yardage. Kansas City is on the brink of a score.\n8:47 p.m.: Great composure by Mahomes and Marquez Valdez-Scantling, both of whom combine to keep Kansas City in the ascendancy.\n8:45 p.m.: Clyde Edwards-Helair keeps the chains moving after strutting through the trenches on third down. KC is into Green Bay territory.\n8:42 p.m.: Patrick Mahomes leads the Chiefs out for their first possession. And it's gotten off to a good start thus far; two plays, two first downs for Kansas City.\n8:39 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Love hits Ben Sims for his first career touchdown!

Decent start for the Packers so far, who have climbed down the gridiron with relative ease in the opening few minutes.\n8:26 p.m.: Wonderful pitch and catch between Love and one of his favorite targets, Christian Watson.

{"title":"Jaguars vs. Saints live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Thursday Night Football' game","context":"## Jaguars vs. Saints live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Thursday Night Football' game\n\n'Tis the season for horrors, and the Jaguars left New Orleans surviving a late scare against the Saints on \"Thursday Night Football.\" '\nJacksonville improved to 5-2 on the season, as Doug Pederson's crew held off a late comeback attempt from New Orleans, emerging with a 31-24 victory. The win pushes the Jaguars' winning streak to four games, while the loss dropped the Saints' record to 3-4.\nThe Jaguars controlled a majority of the game, getting out to an early lead in the first half and entering the fourth quarter up 24-9. At the time, the Saints offense was completely out of sync, as quarterback Derek Carr had just thrown a pick-six to Foye Oluokun and was struggling to connect with any of his key weapons, outside of running back Alvin Kamara.\nHowever, Trevor Lawrence and the Jags let the Saints stick around, failing to put away the opposition. It led to two fourth quarter touchdowns by New Orleans that tied the game with less than six minutes to go, and the momentum had fully shifted at Caesers SuperDome to the home side.\nThat was until Christian Kirk came through for the Jaguars. After the two sides exchanged punts, the wide receiver broke loose for a 44-yard touchdown, re-taking the lead for Jacksonville with 3:08 left to go.\nThe Saints nearly tied the game up in the final seconds of the game. Tight end Foster Moreau had a touchdown in his fingertips on third-and-goal, but he could not come up with the catch. A pass to Chris Olave on fourth down was broken up, as the Jags held on for the win.\nPOWER RANKINGS: Where Saints, Jaguars check in among NFL's best teams entering Week 7\nThe Sporting News provided updates and highlights from Jaguars vs. Saints on Week 7 \"Thursday Night Football.\"\nJaguars vs. Saints score\n1 2 3 4 F Jaguars 7 10 7 7 31 Saints 3 3 3 15 24\nJaguars vs. Saints live results, highlights from 'Thursday Night Football'\n(All times Eastern)\nFinal: Jaguars 31, Saints 24\n11:25 p.m. \u2014 Three QB kneels from Lawrence, and the Jaguars leave New Orleans with a win. Ultimately the offense for the Saints could not put things together until it was too little, too late. Jacksonville improves to 5-2, while New Orleans drops to 3-4.\n11:23 p.m. \u2014 Carr targets Olave on the outside, but Buster Brown locks up the Saints wide receiver and it falls incomplete. That's going to do it, as the Saints come close to making an incredible comeback, but fall just short.\n11:21 p.m. \u2014 Oh, so close for Moreau. On third-and-goal, the tight end is left wide open in the back left corner, Carr finds him, but it goes off Moreau's fingertips and incomplete. It'll be fourth down for the Saints with 25 seconds left.\n11:19 p.m. \u2014 After an Olave catch picks up eight, Kamara rushes for four to get the Saints to the six-yard line. There's under a minute left in regulation with the Saints down seven.\n11:17 p.m. \u2014 Kamara has been excellent tonight for the Saints, in both the passing and running game. He takes a handoff for 18 yards, giving New Orleans a first down at the Jacksonville 18-yard line.\n11:12 p.m. \u2014 Carr hits Hill for 18 yards, then tosses two dump offs to Kamara for gains of nine and seven. The two-minute warning hits with the Saints having the ball at the Jaguars' 41-yard line.\nJaguars 31, Saints 24\n11:12 p.m. \u2014 Touchdown! Kirk sends the SuperDome into silence, as he takes a short-yard pass from Lawrence and weaves through the Saints defense for a 44-yard touchdown.

As he scrambled to his right on third down, he appeared to reach for his groin after throwing the incomplete pass. He stayed down for a bit, spoke to the training staff, and eventually walked his way to the sidelines.\n11:03 p.m. \u2014 The Jaguars pick up a first down, but are stopped on three straight plays and will have to punt. I mentioned this earlier, Jacksonville let New Orleans hang around and now are paying for it. The Saints have the ball with 4:30 to go.\nJaguars 24, Saints 24\n10:57 p.m. \u2014 Touchdown! Bang-bang-TD. Carr tosses one for Thomas at the back of the end zone, and the receiver is able to stay inbounds for the score. New Orleans wasted no time at all getting down field and in the end zone. The Saints go for two, and Carr lofts one to a wide open Kamara to tie the game. After looking dead in the water, the Saints have come alive.\n10:56 p.m. \u2014 Carr connects with Thomas on the first play of the drive for a gain of 17. He follows that up by finding Hill at the 18-yard line for the 19-yard reception.\n10:54 p.m. \u2014 Turnover on downs! Lawrence gives it to Etienne Jr. on a read option, but the Saints wrap up by the running back before he can get the first down. Stop me if you've heard me say this \u2014 the Saints' defense is the sole reason this is remains a close game.

Pederson is electing to keep the offense out there.\n10:50 p.m. \u2014 The Saints can't catch a break. The defense stops the Jaguars on third down, but Paulson Adebo is called for pass interference, giving Jacksonville the automatic first down. The pass looked high, so Adebo felt it was uncatchable, but the officials disagree.\n10:47 p.m. \u2014 After a promising last drive, Carr and Co. get nothing generated and the drive ends in a three-and-out. Carr tried his first deep ball of the night, but it appeared Olave pulled up on the route, increasing the frustration of the Saints QB.\n10:42 p.m. \u2014 Once again, it's the Saints defense that comes through for New Orleans. The unit gets Lawrence to scramble twice, but the Jaguars can't come up with a first down and are forced to punt. The only reason why the Saints are still in this game is because of Allen's defense.\nJaguars 24, Saints 16\n10:38 p.m. \u2014 Touchdown! Hill, who got the Saints near the goal line, punches it in from a yard out, thanks to an excellent block from defensive lineman Khalen Saunders. By far, the best drive of the night for New Orleans, and the offense converts on fourth down to six points. Grupe doinks the extra point off the uprights and in to make it 24-16 with 14:21 left.\nWith DT Khalen Saunders lead blocking, Taysom Hill walks into the end zone \ud83d\ude4c#JAXvsNO on Prime Video\nAlso available on #NFLPlus https:\/\/t.co\/89nUeCngbn pic.twitter.com\/dsN6wkMGKb \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 20, 2023\n10:37 p.m. \u2014 The Saints toss it to Kamara, but he's chased down by the Evan Lloyd before getting over the end zone. New Orleans has to go for it on fourth down from a yard out.\nEnd of the third quarter: Jaguars 24, Saints 9\n10:33 p.m. \u2014 Kamara is denied twice from two yards out, and that's how the third quarter ends. The Saints have been held without a touchdown through the first three quarters, but are knocking on the door with third-and-one.\n10:32 p.m. \u2014 Rayshawn Jenkins take a bad penalty in the end zone for the Jaguars, hitting Foster Moreau late on an incomplete pass. The Saints move up to just two yards out.\n10:31 p.m. \u2014 Taysom Hill gets the call on back-to-back plays for the Saints. Taking it himself each time, he picks up gains of one and five to move the chains.\n10:26 p.m. \u2014 Allen continues to be aggressive on fourth down. After a Kamara catch comes up two yards short, he takes a handoff on fourth down and moves the chains. New Orleans has the ball at the Jaguars' nine-yard line with just over two minutes to go in the quarter.\n10:25 p.m. \u2014 This has been by far the Saints' best drives, and it's been up-tempo with Carr getting the ball quickly out of his hands.\n10:17 p.m. \u2014 After the pick-six, Carr completes six passes in a row, and the Saints have made their way swiftly into Jacksonville territory.\nJaguars 24, Saints 9\n10:17 p.m. \u2014 Pick-six! The woes on the New Orleans offense continue, as Carr forces a throw on third that's deflected up in the air and into the arms of Foye Oluokun. The Jaguars linebacker sprints all the way to the end zone, diving for the pylon. It's getting real ugly on the Saints side, with a frustrated Carr looking completely out of sync with his weapons.\nFoye Oluokun makes a house call off the deflection \u203c\ufe0f #JAXvsNO on Prime Video\nAlso available on #NFLPlus https:\/\/t.co\/89nUeCngbn pic.twitter.com\/6dwZB25nxD \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 20, 2023\n10:12 p.m. \u2014 An interesting play call for the Jaguars on third down just now. Needing six yards at their own 29, the call from the sidelines is a draw, and Etienne Jr. comes up less than a yard short of a first down. Pederson elects not to go for it, and the Jaguars will punt away. Jacksonville is playing a dangerous game, letting New Orleans stick around.\nJaguars 17, Saints 9\n10:06 p.m. \u2014 Field goal! Grupes improves to three of four on the night, booting a 42-yarder. The Saints cut into the Jags' lead, making it a one-score content again.\n10:06 p.m. \u2014 After Hill got the Saints down to the Jacksonville 23, a penalty on second down pushes New Orleans 10 yards back, and the offense can't move the chains.

The Saints running back sprints downfield for a major gain on fourth down.\n10 p.m. \u2014 The Saints can't convert on third down, coming up a half a yard short. However, Allen is keeping the offense out to go for it on fourth down. New Orleans is now one for nine tonight on third down.\n9:58 p.m. \u2014 The second half is underway in New Orleans. The Saints get the ball to start the half, in desperate need of generating anything on offense.\nEnd of first half: Jaguars 17, Saints 6\n9:44 p.m. \u2014 Carr fumbles the ball, it's recovered by one of his lineman, and that's how the first half ends. A fitting end for the Saints, who could get nothing going on offense, leaving the field to boos from the New Orleans fans.\nJaguars 17, Saints 6\n9:42 p.m. \u2014 Field goal! McManus sinks his first attempt of the night, extending the Jaguars lead to 11 with just 32 seconds left in the half. Pederson's aggression pays off, as the fake punt leads to three points.\n9:41 p.m. \u2014 Call reversed! After review, the officials deem the ball hit the ground as Lattimore was trying to make the completion, ruling the play an incomplete pass rather than an interception. With it being fourth down, McManus comes out for a field goal.\n9:38 p.m. \u2014 Interception! Marcus Lattimore comes up with a massive play for the Saints, picking off Lawrence down inside the 10-yard line with just 34 seconds to go in the half. Lawrence was looking for Agnew, but Lattimore dove in front of the receiver for the pick. The officials are going to review to see if Lattimore maintained possession, otherwise it may be an incomplete pass.\n9:36 p.m. \u2014 Fake punt! Not so fast! Pederson dips into bag of tricks and calls for the fake punt. Logan Cooke connects with Tim Jones for a 17-yard gain, and the Jaguars keep possession. That took some stones on Pederson's part, but it pays off, giving Lawrence and the offense a chance to find the end zone before the end of the half.\n9:35 p.m. \u2014 The Saints stop the Jaguars on third down, forcing yet another punt.\n9:32 p.m. \u2014 Two completions, two first downs for the Jaguars. Most importantly, Kirk and Engram both got out of bounds, stopping the clock. The Jaguars have all three timeouts with under two minutes to go.\nJaguars 14, Saints 6\n9:29 p.m. \u2014 Field goal! Grupe hits his second field goal of the night, and the Saints add another three points to their score.\n9:29 p.m. \u2014 New Orleans electing for the points, as Grupe comes out for a 35-yard attempt.\n9:26 p.m. \u2014 The third down struggles continue for the Saints. Carr scrambles on third-and-eight, but only picks up three yards. It's clear that Carr and his receivers aren't quite on the same page. As the two-minute warning hits, it will be fourth-and-five for the Saints.\n9:24 p.m. \u2014 This time, Allen's aggressive decision works, as the Saints get the first down thanks to a 17-yard catch and run by Kamara.\n9:23 p.m. \u2014 The boos are raining down at the SuperDome, as it's another failed third down for the Saints. However, they are going to go for it on fourth-and-three.\n9:20 p.m. \u2014 The Saints defense comes through again for Dennis Allen and Co., forcing the second-straight, three-and-out for the Jaguars. A bad penalty by Antonio Johnson on the punt gives the Saints extra yards, as he runs into returner Rashid Shaheed. It's a 15-yard penalty, and New Orleans starts at the Jacksonville 46-yard line.\n9:15 p.m. \u2014 Olave is the target again on third down, but Carr's pass attempt is broken up by Tre Herndon. The Saints have to punt the ball away as the second quarter reaches the halfway point, with 7:17 left in the half.\n9:12 p.m. \u2014 On the first offensive play of the drive, Carr dumps it off to Kamara, who runs for a gain of 21 yards.\n9:10 p.m. \u2014 The New Orleans defense comes up with a big stop, forcing the Jaguars to a three-and-out. The Saints get the ball back unscathed after failing on the fourth down attempt.\n9:05 p.m. \u2014 The Saints cannot convert on fourth down, as Carr's pass attempt to Chris Olave is tipped away from the receiver. The Jaguars get the bal at their own 44.\n9:05 p.m. \u2014 Darious Williams bats away a third down pass attempt to Michael Thomas, but Dennis Allen is staying aggressive, keeping the offense out on fourth-and-three.\n9:03 p.m. \u2014 An 18-yard completion from Carr to Foster Moreau brings the Saints to their own 48-yard line.\nJaguars 14, Saints 3\n8:58 p.m. \u2014 Touchdown! Etienne Jr. takes a pitch and races 17 yards down the sideline for the score, his second TD of the game. The running back has found the end zone six times in his last three games, as Jacksonville extends its lead early in the second quarter.\n8:57 p.m. \u2014 If the knee is bothering Lawrence, it's hard to tell. The Jaguars QB escapes pressure in the pocket and takes off down field for a run of 26 yards, the second-longest run of his career.\n8:55 p.m. \u2014 The Jaguars bring out a little razzle dazzle. Kirk takes a handoff, tosses it back to Lawrence and the QB finds Agnew for nine yards.\nEnd of the first quarter: Jaguars 7, Saints 3\n8:52 p.m. \u2014 Lawrence connects with Kirk for nine yards on third-and-three, and that's how the first quarter ends.\nJaguars 7, Saints 3\n8:47 p.m. \u2014 Field goal! Grupe knocks down the 23-yard chip shot, and New Orleans is on the board with 1:26 left in the first quarter.\n8:46 p.m. \u2014 Despite the excellent field position, the Saints cannot convert six yards out and instead have to settle for three points.\n8:44 p.m. \u2014 A Kamara completion goes for seven yards, and the Saints have first-and-goal at the Jaguars six-yard line.\n8:40 p.m. \u2014 Fumble!

On the Jaguars first offensive play after the missed Saints field goal, Kirk loses control of the ball after securing a catch and the Saints come up with the recovery. It was Paulson Adebo that punched the ball out. New Orleans gets the ball right back at their own 41-yard line.\n8:33 p.m. \u2014 Missed field goal!

New Orleans will have to settle for a 51-yard field goal attempt by rookie Blake Grupe.\n8:29 p.m. \u2014 Carr uses his legs to pick up another first down and get across midfield.

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nLongtime Hollywood couple Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith sent shockwaves around the world this week when the Red Table Talk host revealed that she and the actor have been separated since 2016. Both Jada and Will have previously doubled down on their stance against getting a divorce, but her recent reveal about their lengthy separation poses a new question: When should couples just get a divorce?\nIn an interview with People on 10 October, Jada shared that during the 2022 Academy Awards - when Will slapped Chris Rock after he cracked a joke about Jada\u2019s appearance - the pair had actually been separated for six years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,\u201d she explained, while promoting her new memoir, Worthy. \u201cWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.\u201d\nShe praised her and Will\u2019s two children - Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22 - for being her \u201clittle gurus\u201d throughout this time, noting that they\u2019ve taught her \u201ca deep sense of self-acceptance\u201d. Although the married couple are not living together, she insisted that their marriage has never been an open one, as she and Will have \u201celiminated the chance of betrayal\u201d while going on to live their \u201cseparate lives\u201d.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Jada and Will have taken some time apart from each other. During a 2020 episode of her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, Jada disclosed that while she and Will were separated amicably, she had a relationship with singer August Alsina, describing their involvement as an \u201centanglement\u201d.\nThroughout their marriage of 26 years, the A-listers have made it clear that divorce was never in the cards. Jada furthered that belief during a preview for an interview with Today\u2019s Hoda Kotb, which aired on 13 October. \u201cI made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will work through, whatever. I just haven\u2019t been able to break that promise.\u201d\nOf course, outsiders aren\u2019t fully aware of the \u201cheavy-duty work\u201d that Jada and Will have done throughout their marriage. But the amount of time they\u2019ve spent separated begs questions about all long-term relationships in general. When is it the time for couples to throw the towel in? And when should separations ultimately become the end result that couples have tried to avoid: divorce.\nWhile there\u2019s never a simple answer to the question, relationship experts have discovered the signs that it\u2019s time to keep fighting for the one you love, or time to let them go.\nSpeaking to The Independent, New York City-based relationship expert Susan Winter highlighted the jarring differences between a separation and divorce. When it comes to divorce, Hollywood couples can notably get involved in lengthy legal processes, from dividing financial assets to creating child custody agreements. Although we don\u2019t know the terms of Jada and Will\u2019s separation, Winter believes that they\u2019re showcasing a non-conventional relationship that\u2019s not familiar to the public. Will and Jada\u2019s dynamic includes living in separate homes, but it could be a choice that\u2019s for the better.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an LAT partnership, meaning \u2018living apart together,\u2019\u201d Winter said. \u201cWhile everybody is at a different point as to why they are doing this, the centre point is the same: the preservation of the partnership is paramount. Separations can also be beneficial if both individuals are working on themselves and have the mutual goal of reuniting, or making their relationship better. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that their improved relationship will result in them living together again.\u201d\nOn the other hand, dating coach Jacob Lucas - who\u2019s based in the UK - acknowledged that not all separations end in resolutions. When couples opt not to live together anymore, it could create an emotional disconnect between them. If a lack of connection occurred before couples separated, that separation doesn\u2019t necessarily make the issues go away. In fact, Lucas believes that in these situations, couples could also be avoiding the inevitable breakup for the sake of comfortability.\n(AFP via Getty Images)\n\u201cThey\u2019re not resolving their problems, they\u2019re rescheduling them. So, if you separate from someone, but you live in a separate house and you\u2019re still together, it seems to me you\u2019re just not letting go of the past because you want to stick to what\u2019s familiar,\u201d he claimed. \u201cPeople stick to what they know, and it\u2019s like you have a tether to that person. Your brain\u2019s like: \u2018I cannot let go of them because I am scared of the unknown.\u2019 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a couple separate and come back again.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Jada and Will plan on ending their separation and living in the same home again. However, the couple have been candid about their plans to not get a divorce. Jada previously recalled that when she first decided to get married to Will in 1997, it would be for the long haul. \u201cI told Will from the gate, I said let me tell you something: \u2018If you marry me, know this: we\u2019re gonna be together. We\u2019re going to be under the same roof,\u2019\u201d she said during a 2018 episode of Red Table Talk. \u201cFor me personally, I\u2019m not mature enough to have a divorce, I\u2019m just not. I don\u2019t think I would ever be mature enough, I don\u2019t.\u201d\nWill - who divorced his first wife, Sheree Zampino, in 1994 - has also shared similar sentiments about making his marriage with Jada work. Back in 2006, the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star first explained to MTV News that divorce wasn\u2019t an option for him and his second wife. \u201cWith Jada, I stood up in front of God and said: \u2018Til death do us part,\u2019\u201d he said at the time. \u201cSo there are two possible outcomes. One, we are going to be together \u2018til death, or two, I am dead.\u201d\nSpeaking to The Independent, Lucas noted that while it\u2019s important for both parties to be invested in their relationships, promising not to get a divorce could spark feelings of resentment down the line. Fans aren\u2019t fully aware of why Will and Jada made that promise to each other, but the dating coach believes that an agreement like theirs could create a false narrative about a divorce.\nJada Pinkett Smith y Will Smith (Getty Images)\n\u201cGetting divorced shouldn\u2019t feel like a taboo because people grow apart and that\u2019s fine,\u201d he explained. \u201cPeople get stuck in relationships because of their friends and family or societal pressure, and they worry about getting divorced. They think a divorce has a stigma to its name, which it doesn\u2019t, and they push aside the fact that they still essentially feel trapped with someone they don\u2019t want to be with.\u201d\nPerhaps one of the reasons why Jada and Will have promised not to get a divorce is because they also agreed not to sign a prenuptial agreement. In an interview with Parade published on 13 October, Jada explained it was her special connection with Will that encouraged them not to sign a prenup before getting married.\n\u201cI feel that was a very real moment for the two of us to look each other in the eyes, recognise that there would be tough times in this journey and to say to each other: \u2018No matter what, we\u2019re going to figure it out and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t need a prenup, because I\u2019m making a promise that divorce won\u2019t be necessary, that we will figure this out,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd we made that promise to each other without all of the bridal wedding beauty; it was just sitting on a log in his mother\u2019s backyard, and going: \u2018Hey\u2019 - having to really look at the possibility of us not being together.\u201d\nAlthough they\u2019ve made their dedication to each other quite clear, there have been some grey areas over the last seven years about the terms of Will and Jada\u2019s separation. In 2020, Jada made headlines when she revealed in a Red Table Talk episode with her husband that she had a relationship with Alsina. She explained that she and her husband were \u201cseparated amicably\u201d when the romance occurred, which had not been disclosed to the press at the time. \u201cWe decided that we were going to separate for a period of time and you go figure out how to make yourself happy and I\u2019ll figure out how to make myself happy,\u201d Jada said. As the Girls Trip star recalled that she \u201cgot into a different kind of entanglement with August,\u201d she was prompted by Will to confirm it \u201cwas a relationship, absolutely.\u201d\nOutsiders are now aware that Jada and Will have been separated since 2016, but the timeline of her relationship with Alsina is still fuzzy. Indeed, the terms of Will and Jada\u2019s separation are still unknown to the public and in some cases, having separate relationships can give couples the clarity they need about their marriage.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s pivotal here is, what was the agreement? Did we agree to separate to work on ourselves for the purpose of coming back together again?\u201d Winter said. \u201cDid we agree to separate and just be alone for a while and not have that discussion? And in the second case, if you have an affair, sometimes it can bring you back to the original person. You can get whatever you need to achieve or gain a different perspective, allowing you to decide if you want to come back or leave for good.\u201d\nWill Smith y Jada Pinkett Smith (Getty Images)\nAccording to Lucas, some of the controversy surrounding Will and Jada\u2019s relationship ties back to the 2022 Academy Awards - when the King Richard star jumped onto the stage and struck Rock across the face after the comedian made a joke about Jada\u2019s shaved head, which is a result of her alopecia. \u201cKeep my wife\u2019s name out of your f***ing mouth,\u201d Will yelled. Now that it\u2019s been revealed the couple was separated at the time, Lucas questioned Will\u2019s behaviour and word choice during the awards ceremony.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a weird reaction to have somebody who you\u2019ve been broken up with for six years, you know? So, were they really broken up or is Jada saying that as an attention-seeking thing?\u201d he asked.\nHowever, Winter still believes the controversial incident speaks different volumes about the work Will has put into his relationship. \u201cI feel as though Will has a tremendous love and commitment to Jada, as well as to the marriage and the family unit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pride that he takes in defending his wife is extraordinary, almost to the detriment of his image, at times.\u201d\nUltimately, the public will never fully know what \u201cheavy-duty work\u201d Will and Jada are doing in their relationship, and according to Winter, it\u2019s not necessarily any of our business. Still, she believes that their choice to separate is something fluid and outside of the traditional marriage design - an evolving model that could also come to serve other couples. If Will and Jada have been spending seven years apart as a married couple, why would they decide to go back to living in the same household?\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the rough with a machete, carving a new path for themselves,\u201d Winter said. \u201cWhy would they say: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go back to the house and just relax?\u2019 They\u2019re really exploring something vastly different. It doesn\u2019t end up that you go back into that little box of \u2018this is a marriage, we\u2019re living together\u2019. It just doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nEvery relationship is different, living in the public eye or not. Although living separately may not be an issue for some couples, there can still be some major signs that it\u2019s time to leave a relationship behind. \u201cWhen there is no stone left unturned, or when they have tried every single combination possible to make the relationship function and yet it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s the time to pull the plug,\u201d Winter added. \u201cThey\u2019ve done their individual work and they have done the work together and ended up in the same place.\u201d\nWill and Jada\u2019s relationship could end in a variety of ways. The celebrity couple could stay separated, move back in together as a married pair, or they can get a divorce. However, there are still certain behaviours in a marriage that could signal it\u2019s time to get a divorce.\n\u201cIf you feel disrespected by your partner, feel humiliated, or were cheated on, you probably feel ready to split,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI also think a real big one is, if you lose sexual attraction for your partner and you\u2019ve actively tried to get it back and can\u2019t, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-16 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":36}

{"title":"There\u2019s something going on with AI startups in France","context":"## There\u2019s something going on with AI startups in France\n\nThere\u2019s something going on with AI startups in France In just a few months, dozens of French entrepreneurs have turned their focus to AI\nLast night, Motier Ventures held a tech meetup focused on AI startups featuring some of the most hyped tech startups in the French tech ecosystem: Dust, Finegrain, Gladia, Mistral AI and Scenario \u2014 all of them are portfolio companies of Motier Ventures. And you could feel a sense of excitement both onstage and in the audience.\nArtificial intelligence, just like in the U.S., has quickly become a buzzy vertical within the French tech industry. But this time, France seems particularly well positioned to become one of the main AI hubs of the world.\nAnd it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Tech giants have historically set up AI research labs in Paris, as there\u2019s a large talent pool of PhD students in math, computer science and engineering. They usually graduate from Polytechnique, ENS or Inria. They sometimes move to the U.S. for postdoctoral research and then move back to France to join a research lab.\nFor instance, Facebook (now Meta) created its Paris research lab back in 2015 with Yann LeCun at the helm of the AI initiative \u2014 this research group is called FAIR, for Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research. Google followed suit with its own AI research center dedicated to AI in Paris.\n\u201cThe FAIR team is extremely impressive. Just look at what they\u2019ve done with Llama,\u201d an entrepreneur told me yesterday. He recently had a private meeting with some of the engineers and scientists working on AI projects.\nAnd if you look at the founders of Mistral AI, the French AI startup working on open source large language models that raised a \u20ac105 million seed round ($112 million at today\u2019s exchange rate), all three co-founders (Arthur Mensch, Timoth\u00e9e Lacroix and Guillaume Lample) previously worked at Google\u2019s DeepMind or FAIR.\nLast night, Mistral\u2019s co-founders put together a demo of Mistral AI in a ChatGPT-like interface called Mistral AI Chat. The demo was based on a new model called \u201cmistral-70b-instruct-alpha01,\u201d indicating that the team is actively working on a new model with more parameters so that it can be more competitive with sophisticated LLMs. According to a recent report from The Information, Mistral AI plans to raise as much as $300 million in the coming weeks.\nMistral isn\u2019t the only high-profile AI company in France. Poolside, a company that recently raised a $126 million seed round, plans to use AI to make it drastically easier to write code. Co-founded by Jason Warner, the former CTO of GitHub, and Eiso Kant, a serial entrepreneur who worked on Athenian and source{d}, the company has picked Paris as its home base.\nDust, a company that is working on integrating large language models with internal corporate data from GitHub, Notion or Slack, also took the stage for a demo last night. At Dust\u2019s office warming party, I realized that Dust shares its beautiful office building with Nabla, another French AI startup focused on helping doctors leverage large language models and co-founded by former FAIR engineers. This proves once again that an AI ecosystem is emerging.\nThe founders of Mistral AI and Dust had to leave the meetup quickly after their demos as they were both invited for dinner at the Elys\u00e9e Palace, the residence of Emmanuel Macron. So there\u2019s also some public support for AI startups in France. An entrepreneur recently told me that multiple AI startups are working together on public tenders for government grants worth millions of euros as part of France 2030.\nOne thing that might differentiate European AI startups from AI giants like OpenAI and Anthropic is that they\u2019re thinking about regulation and compliance from day one. An interesting French AI startup in this field is Giskard, which is developing an open source testing framework, or \u201cthe best LLM antivirus in the market,\u201d as Giskard co-founder and CEO Alex Combessie told me. I\u2019ll have more to write about Giskard in the coming days.\nAnd another wave of stealth AI startups\nEarlier this week, The Information reported that Adaptive, an AI startup based in Amsterdam and co-founded by French AI researcher Julien Launay, was about to raise a seed around at a $100 million valuation. Adaptive helps companies iterate on their AI applications without relying on external data or annotations.\nA source confirmed that Index Ventures is leading the Adaptive round, with Iconiq and Motier Ventures participating.\nAnother source told me that Index Ventures is also leading a seed round for an AI startup with a team split between Paris and London.\nIn other news, I\u2019ve heard that Steeve Morin, a key member of the team behind Zenly, a popular consumer app that was acquired by Snap, is also creating an AI startup called ZML. The team will focus on improving machine learning inference and other low-level tools.\nMaxime Germain, the founder of mental health startup Jour, which was acquired by Alan, is leaving Alan to start Heart Hands, an AI startup that is developing a \u201csecond brain in your pocket,\u201d as an investor described it to me.\nPierre Valade, the founder of Sunrise and Jumbo, is putting together a team for an AI startup currently called Chief of Staff. Hugo Mercier is working on an AI startup in stealth mode as well.\nI think it\u2019s safe to call this new wave of startups a trend. While the overall tech ecosystem is still experiencing a downturn, there\u2019s an absurd amount of activity among French startups at the early stage with new AI startups getting founded at a rapid pace and VC firms fighting for the most competitive funding rounds.\n\nThis article, authored by Romain Dillet, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-09 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":38}
{"title":"Amazon\u2019s iRobot purchase sucks up formal competition concerns in EU","context":"## Amazon\u2019s iRobot purchase sucks up formal competition concerns in EU\n\nEuropean Union regulators have sent Amazon a formal statement of objections setting out competition concerns over its proposed acquisition of robot vacuum maker, iRobot.\nThe step does not confirm the EU will seek to block the deal but it shows antitrust regulators do remain concerned. It could therefore push Amazon to offer remedies to EU authorities to settle the investigation and avoid the risk of the acquisition being blocked.\nAmazon has already lowered its acquisition price for iRobot \u2014 which was originally an all-cash offer of $1.7 billion back in August 2022 \u2014 by 15% owing to increased debt taken on by its target while regulatory snags delayed closing the deal at the original purchase price.\nThe bloc has been closely scrutinizing the Amazon-iRobot deal since July when the EU announced its in-depth probe. The Commission said at the time it was worried the transaction would allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners (RVCs) and strengthen its position as online marketplace provider in a number of ways.\nToday\u2019s announcement by the EU, following several months of in-depth examination looking at how the transaction might impact competition, lays out formal concerns for Amazon to respond to. The EU\u2019s objections focus on foreclosure risks.\nThe EU says its concerns focus on whether the deal will give Amazon the ability and incentive to foreclose iRobot\u2019s rivals by deploying strategies aimed at preventing competitors from selling RVCs on Amazon\u2019s marketplace and\/or making it harder for them to do so \u2014 such as by delisting rival products; reducing their visibility in both non-paid (i.e. organic) and paid results (i.e. ads) displayed on its marketplace; limiting their access to certain widgets it operates (such as the \u201cother products you may like\u201d feature) or \u201ccertain commercially-attractive product labels\u201d (e.g. \u2018Amazon\u2019s choice\u2019 or \u2018Works With Alexa\u2019); and\/or by directly or indirectly raising the costs of iRobot\u2019s rivals to advertise and sell their RVCs on its marketplace.\n\u201cAmazon may have the ability to foreclose iRobot\u2019s rivals because Amazon\u2019s online marketplace is a particularly important channel to sell RVCs in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain,\u201d the Commission writes in a press release. \u201cRVC customers in these countries particularly rely on Amazon both in terms of product discovery as well as for their final purchasing decision.\u201d\nThe Commission is also worried Amazon may have the incentive to foreclose iRobot\u2019s rivals because it may be economically profitable for it to do so. \u201cThe merged entity would likely gain more from additional sales of iRobot RVCs, than it would lose from fewer sales of iRobot\u2019s rivals and other related products on Amazon. Such gains include benefits from additional data gathered from iRobot\u2019s users,\u201d it suggests.\nWere Amazon to deploy such foreclosure strategies the Commission\u2019s view at this stage of the probe is it could restrict competition in the market for RVCs, leading to \u201chigher prices, lower quality, and less innovation for consumers\u201d.\nThe EU has reached this pass of laying out formal concerns after conducting what it describes as a \u201cwide-ranging investigation to understand the market and the potential impact of the deal\u201d, which it says included analysing internal documents provided by Amazon and iRobot and gathering views from market participants such as suppliers of RVCs and other smart home devices, as well as from providers of online sales channels.\nIt also says it closely cooperated with other competition authorities during both the initial investigation and the in-depth investigation, adding that it will continue to do so during the remainder of the in-depth investigation. Although the U.K.\u2019s competition authority already cleared the deal back in June.\nAmazon was contacted for a response to the EU\u2019s statement of objections. A company spokesperson sent us this statement in which it claims iRobot faces \u201cintense competition\u201d from other RVC suppliers:\nWe continue to work through the process with the European Commission and are focused on addressing its questions and any identified concerns at this stage. iRobot, which faces intense competition from other vacuum cleaner suppliers, offers practical and inventive products. We believe Amazon can offer a company like iRobot the resources to accelerate innovation and invest in critical features while lowering prices for consumers.\nLate last year the EU settled with Amazon over two earlier competition probes \u2014 one delving into antitrust concerns about Amazon\u2019s use of merchant data to bolster its own retail business; and a second one looking at how it operated the \u201cBuy Box\u201d and its Prime loyalty program.\nIn those cases Amazon agreed a series of commitments to end the probes \u2014 including saying it would stop using non-public data from its marketplace sellers and boost transparency for merchants; and pledging to treat all sellers equally, regardless of whether they pay for its logistics services.\nAt the time the EU\u2019s then competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, trumpeted the outcome as setting what she dubbed \u201cnew rules for how Amazon operates its business in Europe\u201d \u2014 arguing the settlement meant the ecommerce giant could \u201cno longer abuse its dual role\u201d as marketplace operator and own brand retailer; and further claiming the outcome would ensure \u201ccompeting independent retailers and carriers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes opening up new opportunities and choice.\u201d\nGiven the commitments the EU already extracted from Amazon after those earlier investigations it\u2019s interesting to see the bloc remains concerned over levers the ecommerce behemoth still has its disposal to potentially influence competitive outcomes on its marketplace vis-\u00e0-vis iRobot vs rival robot vacs.\nSince then Amazon has also been named a gatekeeper under the EU\u2019s shiny new ex ante competition regulation, the Digital Markets Act \u2014 which lists its marketplace as a core platform service. This designation means Amazon must comply with a series of up-front obligations, which include restrictions on self preferencing.\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-27 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":39}
{"title":"NFL standings: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture for Week 13 of 2023 season","context":"## NFL standings: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture for Week 13 of 2023 season\n\nThe NFL playoff race is heating up as the calendar flips to December, the penultimate month of the 2023 regular season. With only six weeks of games left through Week 18, 14 teams are looking to position themselves well as either division leaders or wild-card hopefuls.\nAlthough there are some dominant teams headed to a return to the playoffs, most scenarios are in flux with seeding and potential entrants. Here's a look at the updated NFL playoff picture during a 13-game slate with six teams on bye, now after Week 13:\nPOWER RANKINGS: 49ers jump Eagles at top; Packers, Colts keep rising as Chiefs, Steelers fade for Week 14\nNFL standings after Week 13\nAFC playoff picture\n1.. Miami Dolphins (9-3), first place, AFC East. The Dolphins matched the Ravens' record in their dominant road victory at the Commanders. For now they have the conference record tiebreaker to jump into this spot. With beating Washington, they opened up a 3-game division lead on the idle Bills.\n2. Baltimore Ravens (9-3), first place, AFC North. The Ravens went into their bye with a half-game lead for home-field advantage and the lone playoff bye, over three teams right behind them. The tiebreakers, however, will shake things up a bit depending on which of two favored teams, the Chiefs and Jaguars, join the Dolphins in winning in separate matchups. The Ravens also lead the Steelers by 1.5 games in the division.\n3. Kansas City Chiefs (8-4), first place, AFC West. The Chiefs have wins over the Jaguars and Dolphins to help them in the tiebreakers. They will win the division again and push for No. 1. But losing to the Packers on the road in Week 13 keeps them as No. 3 as the Jaguars lost on Monday night to stay behind them.\n4. Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4), first place, AFC South. The Jaguars had a chance to match the Dolphins and Ravens on Monday night but their home overtime loss to the Bengals dropped them behind the also losing Chiefs, to whom they lost. With the upset, Jacksonville also saw its division lead drop to one over Indianapolis and Houston.\n5. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-5), second place, AFC North. The Steelers lost Kenny Pickett and all their offensive promise in one fell swoop against the Cardinals, also hurt by the weather in the shocking upset at home. They remain here, however, because of the Browns also losing.\n6. Indianapolis Colts (7-5) second place, AFC South. The Colts kept up their surprise playoff momentum, still with a head-to-head tiebreaker ahead of the Texans, with a win over the Titans in Tennessee in Week 13. The Colts don't have a rematch with the Texans until Week 18 in Indianapolis.\n7. Cleveland Browns (7-5), third place, AFC North. The Browns also lost to a lesser overall NFC West foe in the Rams, only on the road. Joe Flacco tried to get their offense going but now the concern is the defense falling apart and regressing at the wrong time.\nWho's in the hunt?\n8. Houston Texans (7-5)\n9. Denver Broncos (6-6)\n10. Buffalo Bills (6-6)\n11. Cincinnati Bengals (6-6)\n12. Los Angeles Chargers (5-7)\n13. Las Vegas Raiders (5-7)\n14. New York Jets (4-8)\n15. Tennessee Titans (4-8)\nThe Texans beat the Broncos Houston in a key wild-card determining matchup in Week 13. The Bills and Raiders are off to regroup for a run, while the Bengals are staying resilient without Joe Burrow. The Chargers won on the road at the Patriots to maintain a playoff pulse, but the Titans and Jets lose close games at home.\nNFC playoff picture\n1. Philadelphia Eagles (10-2), first place, NFC East. The Eagles fell for the second time this season as their run of beating high-quality opponents in comeback fashion ended in getting routed by the 49ers at home. They now lead the division by only one game over the Cowboys and are in real danger of losing home-field advantage and the lone bye to the 49ers, too.\n2. San Francisco 49ers (9-3), first place, NFC West. The 49ers' red-hot ways since getting fully healthy around Brock Purdy after their bye continue with a dominant offensive performance against the Eagles. They made a statement that they are the new team to beat in the conference, wherever they play. Up three games on the Rams and Seahawks, another division title is coming, too.\n3. Detroit Lions (9-3), first place, NFC North. The Lions are still in great shape to win the division with a 3-game lead over the Vikings and the Packers after beating the Saints in New Orleans in Week 13. But they're looking more like the No. 2 seed will be their ceiling.\n4. Atlanta Falcons (6-6), first place, NFC South. The Falcons are in control of the NFL's weakest division thanks to beating the Saints and earning the head-to-head tiebreaker in Week 12. They got to .500 and increased their lead to a full game by beating the Jets in Week 13.\n5. Dallas Cowboys (9-3), second place, NFC East. The Cowboys opened Week 13 by rallying to beat the Seahawks on Thursday night, keeping the heat on the losing Eagles ahead of them before hosting that team in Dallas in Week 14. They can finish No. 1, No, 2 or No. 3 if they win the division and are locked into No. 5 again otherwise.\n6. Minnesota Vikings (6-6), second place, NFC North. The Vikings jumped up a spot during their bye with the Seahawks losing on Thursday night to match their record on Thursday night. They have the tiebreaker over the three other .500 NFC teams based on conference record, but right behind them is the team in third place in the division.\n7. Green Bay Packers (6-6), third place, NFC North. The Packers moved into the final playoff spot thanks to having the second-best conference record after the Vikings, to whom they already lost but face again in Minnesota in Week 17. The Packers also hold key wins over the Rams and Saints in the wild-card race.\nWho's in the hunt?\n8. Los Angeles Rams (6-6)\n9. Seattle Seahawks (6-6)\n10. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-7)\n11. New Orleans Saints (5-7)\n12. New York Giants (4-8)\n13. Chicago Bears (4-8)\n14. Washington Commanders (4-9)\nThe Rams and Seahawks are the best wild-card bets here now, while the Saints and Buccaneers will still have their sights on making the playoffs via still winning the weak South over the Falcons.\n\nThis article, authored by Vinnie Iyer, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-03 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":40}

{"title":"What to know about Fortnite maker Epic Games\u2019 antitrust battle with Google, starting today","context":"## What to know about Fortnite maker Epic Games\u2019 antitrust battle with Google, starting today\n\nMatch may have settled its antitrust lawsuit with Google last week, but Fortnite maker Epic Games is still set to go to trial with the tech giant today, November 6, in hopes of convincing a jury that Google engages in anticompetitive behavior with regard to its Android app store, Google Play, and its commission structure. This case will differ slightly from Epic\u2019s battle with Apple on the same topic because, this time, Epic can\u2019t allege there\u2019s no other way to load apps onto Android devices, as it could with Apple, because Android does allow for sideloading apps. Though Epic will suggest Google makes that process cumbersome, the bulk of its arguments will center around what it believes are anticompetitive agreements between Google and device manufacturers and developers.\nThe precedent Epic\u2019s case will rely on is a Microsoft case where courts found Microsoft to have a monopoly over the operating system and were abusing it, making it hard for users to download alternative browsers, like Netscape, on Windows devices.\nTo make its case, Epic plans to bring claims under Sections 1 and 2 of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, as well as California\u2019s anticompetitive laws, the Cartwright Act, and the Unfair Competition Law. It will attempt to argue that Google restrains competition within two separate markets, including the distribution of apps to Android users and the market for payment processing solutions for content inside Android apps.\nGoogle argues its commissions aren\u2019t just tied to billing, but offers discount for third-party billing options\nToday, Google requires apps to use its own first-party billing system, and charges app developers a 15% to 30% commission on the sales it processes.\nHowever, Google will counter Epic\u2019s arguments by pointing out that it has rolled out a new option for app developers called User Choice Billing, which Epic has declined to use. This program, still in pilot testing, is open to all developers who sell apps in the 35 markets where it\u2019s now available, including the U.S., and reduces the standard commission by 4% for companies who choose to use their own payment processing solution. Spotify and Bumble were the initial testers for the new system, first introduced in November 2022, and Match, as part of its settlement agreement, will also now take advantage of this option.\nGoogle will also argue that its commissions aren\u2019t just tied to payment processing, but rather help it to develop other features and controls to keep Android users safe and guide them to discovering new applications, as well as help fund the tools and services developers need to build and grow their apps. Google also helps developers reach a broader audience beyond the mobile phone, with support for Android across platforms, ranging from tablets to TVs to autos and more. And it will note that 99% of its developers qualify for a commission of 15% or less, based on their revenues.\nThe competitive landscape with other app stores, OEMs\nThe tech giant additionally plans to push back at Epic\u2019s claims that it doesn\u2019t have competition in the app store business. It will point out that not only does the Play Store compete with Apple\u2019s App Store, which the Ninth Circuit ruling in the Apple case agreed upon, too, but Android also supports competitive app stores like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Store and Amazon\u2019s Appstore.\nEpic, however, will attempt to demonstrate that Google makes it hard for alternative app stores to succeed and reach consumers, noting that 90% of apps are still downloaded through Google Play. And it will point out that Google bundles the Play Store with other Google apps that Android OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) have to agree to in order to use Android.\nEpic will also bring up \u201cAnti-Fragmentation Agreements\u201d (AFAs) that prevent the OEMs from modifying Android to allow for frictionless downloading of apps outside of Google Play. Epic Games will specifically reference one agreement it had made with the OEM OnePlus, to make Epic games available on its devices through the Epic Games app. But OnePlus had to cancel the deal over concerns that the arrangement would have it bypassing the Google Play Store. The case will also examine a deal between Google and Samsung that Epic says was designed to prevent the Galaxy Store from being a competitive threat and require Google Play Billing on apps distributed by Samsung.\nEpic will argue Google\u2019s developer agreements are anti-competitive\nA second set of agreements Epic will highlight are those between Google and Android app developers themselves. One such program, the \u201cProject Hug\u201d initiative, a part of the Google Games Velocity Program, will be cited as an example of where Google paid competitors not to distribute their apps on Android outside of the Play Store by targeting those that were most at risk of attrition from Play, then approaching them with a monetary offer. As an example, Epic will point to Activision Blizzard, the owner of King.com and maker of Candy Crush and Call of Duty, as one developer that wanted to go the route of opening its own app store. Google and Activision Blizzard then entered into a three-year agreement in January 2020, worth approximately $360 million, to keep the developer on Google Play, Epic will argue.\nGoogle, however, will characterize this program as a way to incentivize developers to launch their apps on Android at the same time as they launch on iOS and plans to dispute Epic\u2019s claims that it prevented developers from opening their own app stores.\nAndroid allows sideloading\nGoogle will make note that, unlike Apple, it also allows apps to be sideloaded on Android devices \u2014 something Epic takes advantage of today. It will note this process is streamlined and helps keep users safe. But Epic will claim that this process is made to be overly difficult for end users, with multiple steps involved and \u201cscare screens\u201d that warn users of the security risks involved with sideloading.\nEpic will also suggest that Google hid items from discovery by allowing execs and employees to have \u201coff the record\u201d chats, but Google will counter this as well, saying it has provided the court with thousands of chat logs and millions of documents.\nThe tech giant will ultimately push the notion that this case isn\u2019t about competition, but about money \u2014 that is, Epic Games wants to reach the Play Store\u2019s 2.5 billion users without having to pay.\n\u201cAndroid\u2019s choice and flexibility work well for consumers and developers of all sizes. We look forward to making our case in court as we fight to keep our users safe from harm, partner with developers to grow their businesses, and keep the Android ecosystem thriving and healthy for everyone,\u201d reads a Google blog post by Wilson White, VP, Government Affairs & Public Policy.\nEpic\u2019s lawsuit originally involved Match and several U.S. attorneys general, but Google reached a settlement with the latter last month and with Match last week. Epic will now fight the antitrust battle on its own. The lawsuit, held in the U.S. District Court in California\u2019s Northern District, will include testimony from a number of Google and Android execs, including CEO Sundar Pichai, and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, as well as Apple, Netflix and other Android developers.\nGoogle is also involved in another antitrust lawsuit with the Department of Justice over its alleged search monopoly. Epic, meanwhile, lost its antitrust battle with Apple and is now asking the Supreme Court to weigh in.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-06 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":42}

However, as I\u2019m traveling back, I\u2019ve never regretted it: There\u2019s always something magical that comes out of going to an event, in my experience.\nOur TC+ team is not interested in anecdotes, however: neither mine nor Alexis\u2019. So, like the data-driven journalists they are, they surveyed more than 50 founders, trying to figure out whether attending events still makes sense in 2023.\nSpoiler alert: There isn\u2019t a real consensus, but there are some really good pros and cons.

The company\u2019s ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app hit a record $4.6 million in revenue last month, but growth is slowing.

{"title":"When pop culture and sport collide: A timeline of Taylor Swift\u2019s NFL takeover","context":"## When pop culture and sport collide: A timeline of Taylor Swift\u2019s NFL takeover\n\nThe first link between Swift and Kelce was established in 2016, when Kelce \u2013 who helped bring his team to Super Bowl victory in both 2020 and 2023 \u2013 played the classic game \u201cKiss, Marry, Kill\u201d. Speaking with AfterBuzz TV, Kelce was given the options of Swift, Katy Perry and Ariana Grande. He said he\u2019d ultimately kill Grande, marry Perry and kiss Swift. That was about six years ago, but it has more recently set tongues wagging as fans wondered how long the plan for them to meet has been in the works. Cruel Summer Fast-forward seven years, and things started to heat up. In July, speaking on the podcast he shares with his brother, New Heights, Kelce said he intended to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number on it during her Eras Tour concert in Kansas City. Unfortunately, the bracelet never made it to her wrist or his digits to her phone.\n\u201cI was disappointed that she doesn\u2019t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t meet anybody, or at least she didn\u2019t want to meet me, so I took it personal[sic].\u201d At this point, it seems like any attraction between the two was one-sided. Kelce\u2019s attempts to make proper contact with Swift at the show ultimately failed. Was she just not that into him? But Kelce, exhibiting the tenacity typical of a professional sportsman, remained determined to get her attention. Wildest Beards The Kelce brothers couldn\u2019t stop talking about Swift, even though she\u2019d left Travis hanging at the concert. Swift\u2019s name began popping up everywhere on the podcast, including during conversations about... facial hair?\nIn August, the brothers discussed Kelce\u2019s moustache, which he grows every year in honour of the Chief\u2019s head coach, Andy Reid. When asked if he knew what Swift thought of the \u2019stache, he remained cheekily confident. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to bring up Taylor Swift in this episode,\u201d he says, \u201cBut something tells me she\u2019s going to like it.\u201d There was a clear suggestion Kelce had made contact with Swift, and was even going to meet her. Shortly after that remark, Kelce took a week off training to visit New York City, according to Vulture. Coincidentally, this happened to be while Swift was re-recording her 1989 tracks in the city. Welcome to New York\nThe suspicion the two were actually spending time together in New York was seemingly confirmed in September when it was reported they had been \u201cquietly hanging out\u201d for months. This was the first, albeit tentative, confirmation from the media rather than from amateur Swiftie sleuths on social media. So, it was only a matter of time before it entered the cultural zeitgeist. Blank Space Which it did, very quickly. On September 17, Kelce scored a touchdown against the Jaguars, triggering CBS announcer Ian Eagle to reference Swift\u2019s 2014 hit, Blank Space.\n\u201cKelce finds a blank space for the score,\u201d Eagle said, poking fun at Kelce\u2019s newfound Swiftie status. And Eagle wasn\u2019t the only one, with NFL Network\u2019s Rich Eisen including a slew of lyric references during a preshow, including \u201cshake it off\u201d, \u201canti-hero\u201d and \u201call too well\u201d. Kelce even acknowledged the tongue-in-cheek banter, commenting on a montage video of the preshow that Eisen posted to Instagram. \u201cWell played Rich \u2026 Well played,\u201d he wrote. Suddenly, football fans and Swifties were living through this surprising collision. Swift lyrics were infiltrating NFL game commentary, and her fans were furiously becoming football experts. All that needed to happen was for Swift herself to infiltrate a game, determining once and for all whether there was anything to these rumours or not. This Is Me Trying\nOn September 21, Kelce announced on The Pat McAfee Show he had invited Swift to watch one of his games. \u201cI told her, \u2018I\u2019ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock a stage at Arrowhead and we can see which one\u2019s a little more lit,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens in the near future.\u201d Were they finally about to hard-launch their friendship\/potential romance to the world, laying all speculation to rest? Love Story This finally brings us to the fated sighting of Swift at Arrowhead Stadium on Monday, cheering on No. 87 with gusto.\nThe 12-time Grammy winner appeared to shout \u201clet\u2019s f\u2014ing go\u201d after Kelce scored a touchdown before chest-bumping other Chiefs fans. Considering Swift is known for being an Eagles fan \u2013 she\u2019s originally from Pennsylvania and even references the team in Gold Rush \u2013 her outward support for the Kelce\u2019s team seemed extra telling. Swifties were immediately on high alert, with some capturing Swift and Kelce leaving the stadium together. If that wasn\u2019t enough, extra observant fans were able to note that Kelce\u2019s blue and white post-game outfit was supposedly labelled the \u201c1989 bedroom painting set\u201d, perhaps an intentional reference to Swift\u2019s 2014 album, which she will be re-releasing in October. Swift\u2019s penchant for Easter eggs must be rubbing off on the tight end player. As if this weren\u2019t enough subtle references already, they were also spotted in a \u201cgetaway car\u201d together outside the stadium \u2013 potentially a nod towards her 2017 track. Could they have been driving off into the sunset? Of course, none of this actually confirms Swift and Kelce are actually dating. But regardless of whether it\u2019s a friendship or a romantic relationship, it has sent shockwaves through two massive cultural franchises, expanding the NFL\u2019s audience into uncharted territory. It\u2019s a cultural pairing on par with \u2013 and perhaps even bigger than \u2013 Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nThis article, authored by Nell Geraets, was published by The Age on 2023-09-26 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":44}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nTravis Kelce has hilariously confessed that he attempted to delete some of his tweets before they went viral.\nThe 34-year-old football star spoke candidly about his previous posts on X - formerly known as Twitter - during an episode of his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce, which aired on 22 November. The comments came after some of Kelce\u2019s funny tweets from 2010 and 2011 resurfaced amid his rumoured relationship with Taylor Swift.\nWhen Jason quipped that everyone is \u201ca big fan of college Travis on Twitter\u201d, the Kansas City Chiefs star acknowledged that his posts weren\u2019t really noticed back then. However, Kelce explained that he was trying to remove his tweets from social media even before they went viral.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s hilarious is that nobody followed me back then,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will say I have been trying to get all those tweets deleted. Like since I got into the league, I\u2019m like: \u2018Gosh, I just want all those things to get deleted.\u2019\u201d\nHe poked fun at how his tweets are now being mocked, adding: \u201cAnd sure enough, it came surface-level and everybody f***ing dove in, in 2011. What a f***ing year that was.\u201d\nThe Philadelphia Eagles star continued to discuss the viral responses to his brother\u2019s tweets. He even referenced how Jimmy Fallon and his band performed a song, titled \u201cThe Ballad of Travis Kelce\u201d, on The Tonight Show - in which the late-night host recited Kelce\u2019s old tweets. The two brothers highlighted the now fan-favourite post, which reads: \u201cI just gave a squirle a piece of bread and it straight smashed all of it!!!! I had no idea they ate bread like that!! Haha #crazy.\u201d\nKelce later revealed the meanings behind some of his viral tweets, noting that he would simply share the remarks for fun. \u201cI was just using Twitter like a diary. I\u2019m just out here saying nonsense - \u2018I just gave a squirrel a piece of bread\u2019 - and spelled squirrel like a jacka**,\u201d Kelce said.\nJason mocked his brother for his spelling of \u201csquirrel\u201d in the tweet, before claiming that\u2019s the reason why the post went viral in the first place. \u201cI\u2019m only spelling squirrel like that from now on, I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s spelled the other way,\u201d he joked. \u201cThis one gets crushed, but I think the only reason it\u2019s getting crushed is because of the spelling. Outside of that, if I\u2019m throwing bread around and a squirrel is eating it I\u2019d be pretty pumped up.\u201d\nEarlier this month, fans of the A-list couple took to X to share screenshots of some of Kelce\u2019s old tweets - including one post from 2010 that reads: \u201c#Chipotle will always be a great choice!!!!\u201d\nThe NFL player\u2019s tweets have unsurprisingly resurfaced amid his relationship with Swift, who he\u2019s been romantically linked to since the summer. The dating speculation first began in July, when Kelce confessed that he tried and failed to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number on it during her Eras Tour show. On his podcast, he later invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to one of his games at Arrowhead Stadium - an invitation she famously accepted on 24 September. Since then, Swift has attended three more of Kelce\u2019s games.\nKelce showed his support for Swift when he attended her Eras Tour show in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 11 November. During the concert, Swift gave a shout-out to the Chiefs player when she changed her \u201cKarma\u201d lyrics to reflect their relationship. \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\u201d she sang, letting out a laugh as fans in the audience screamed in response. The \u201cAll Too Well\u201d singer was later seen running into his arms and kissing the NFL player following the concert, as he whisked her away backstage.\nIn an interview withWSJ Magazine published on 20 November, Kelce described how much he admires Swift\u2019s skills as a musician. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I\u2019m learning every day,\u201d he explained.\nAlthough he acknowledged the public attention his personal life has received because he\u2019s \u201cnever dated anyone with that kind of aura around them,\u201d Kelce specified that he\u2019s not letting the media affect his relationship.\n\u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m not running away from any of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she\u2019s just living, enjoying life.\n\u201cWhen she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-11-25 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":45}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nTaylor Swift has officially been named Time\u2019s 2023 Person of the Year.\nOn Wednesday 6 December, the magazine announced Swift had earned the honour after an \u201ceditors\u2019 assessment of the individual who most shaped the headlines over the previous 12 months, for better or for worse\u201d.\nThe recognition of Swift comes on the heels of a whirlwind year for the popstar, whose Eras Tour dominated ticket sales in 2023. \u201cThis is the proudest and happiest I\u2019ve ever felt, and the most creatively fulfilled and free I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Swift told Time. \u201cUltimately, we can convolute it all we want, or try to overcomplicate it, but there\u2019s only one question... Are you not entertained?\u201d\nSwift was chosen among a strong list of contenders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, King Charles III, the live-action Barbie movie, and Vladimir Putin. \u201cWhile her popularity has grown across the decades, this is the year that Swift, 33, achieved a kind of nuclear fusion: shooting art and commerce together to release an energy of historic force,\u201d the magazine said about its selection.\nThis year alone, Swift has broken records with her career-spanning Eras Tour, which is estimated to have grossed over $1.4bn. Her concert film, the Eras Tour movie, has surpassed $250m at the global box office since its opening weekend in October. Not to mention her rumoured relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce caused a 400 per cent spike in NFL jersey sales.\nSince her first NFL appearance in September, Swift\u2019s occasional attendance at Kelce\u2019s games has received pushback from NFL fans who believe her presence is distracting from the game itself. \u201cI\u2019m just there to support Travis,\u201d Swift admitted. \u201cI have no awareness of if I\u2019m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.\u201d\nShe playfully added: \u201cFootball is awesome, it turns out. I\u2019ve been missing out my whole life.\u201d\nThe \u201cBad Blood\u201d singer revealed that their romance began when Kelce gave her shoutout on his podcast, admitting he attempted to give Swift his phone number after one of her Eras Tour shows. The pair immediately began \u201changing out\u201d and by the time she attended her first Chiefs game in September, they were already a couple. \u201cI think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date,\u201d Swift joked.\nBack in April, it was revealed that Swift and British actor Joe Alwyn had broken up after six years of dating. The former couple were notoriously private, as the Conversations with Friends star previously expressed he didn\u2019t want to discuss their relationship because it \u201cfeeds into a weird part of the culture\u201d.\nNow, Swift has shared that she has nothing to hide in her new relationship with Kelce. \u201cWhen you say a relationship is public, that means I\u2019m going to see him do what he loves, we\u2019re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cThe opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you\u2019re seeing someone. And we\u2019re just proud of each other.\u201d\nSpeaking to Time, Swift detailed exactly how much work went into preparing for her Eras Tour - where each concert spans over 180 minutes, with more than 40 songs from at least nine albums and 16 costume changes. \u201cEvery day I would run on the treadmill, singing the entire set list out loud,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cFast for fast songs, and a jog or a fast walk for slow songs.\u201d\nShe also stopped drinking and underwent three months of dance training, something that she admitted is \u201cnot my strong suit\u201d. After she plays a run of shows, Swift said she takes a day to rest and recover before taking the stage once again. \u201cI do not leave my bed except to get food and take it back to my bed and eat it there,\u201d she revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream scenario.\u201d\nMost recently, a heat wave in Brazil forced Swift to postpone the second night of her Eras Tour shows in Rio de Janeiro. The decision came after one of the singer\u2019s fans, 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides, died from a cardiac arrest during Swift\u2019s first performance in the country. Swift explained to Time that \u201cpart of my identity as a human\u201d is putting on a show for her fans, no matter the circumstances. \u201cI know I\u2019m going on that stage whether I\u2019m sick, injured, heartbroken, uncomfortable, or stressed,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of my identity as a human being now. If someone buys a ticket to my show, I\u2019m going to play it unless we have some sort of force majeure.\u201d\nPerhaps it was her decision to re-record her music catalogue that catapulted Swift into such success. When music mogul Scooter Braun aquired Swift\u2019s longtime label, Big Machine Records, in 2019, he also gained the rights to the master recordings of Swift\u2019s first six studio albums. In November 2020, Braun sold the masters to an investment fund in a deal that was believed to be over $300 million. Since then, Swift has released four \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d albums: Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version) in April 2021, Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) in November 2021, Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) in July 2023, and 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) in October 2023.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that the two great catalysts for this happening were two horrendous things that happened to me,\u201d Swift said, when asked about the success of her tour. \u201cThe first was getting cancelled within an inch of my life and sanity. The second was having my life\u2019s work taken away from me by someone who hates me.\u201d\nWhile Swift is arguably more famous now than ever before, the Grammy winner revealed that the constant attention and swarms of paparazzi won\u2019t stop her from living her life. There\u2019s also constant rumours surrounding her personal life, specifically rumours about her relationship with Alwyn that her publicist, Tree Paine, was forced to publicly deny.\n\u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve learned I don\u2019t have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don\u2019t matter,\u201d Swift told Time. \u201cYes, if I go out to dinner, there\u2019s going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends.\n\u201cLife is short. Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years - I\u2019ll never get that time back,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m more trusting now than I was six years ago.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Chelsea Ritschel, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-12-06 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":46}
{"title":"One year later, ChatGPT is still alive and kicking","context":"## One year later, ChatGPT is still alive and kicking\n\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s viral AI chatbot, turns one today.\nA year ago, OpenAI released ChatGPT as a \u201clow-key research preview\u201d \u2014 reportedly spurred in part by an intense rivalry with AI startup Anthropic. The goal, OpenAI leadership told the OpenAI rank-and-file at the time, was to gather more data on how people use and interact with generative AI to inform the development of OpenAI\u2019s future models.\nInitially a basic free-to-use, web-based and chat-focused interface on top of one of OpenAI\u2019s existing models, GPT-3.5, ChatGPT would go on to become the company\u2019s most popular product\u2026 ever \u2014 and the fastest-growing consumer app in history.\na year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning\u2019s launch. what a year it\u2019s been\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023\nIn the months following its launch, ChatGPT gained paid tiers with additional features, including a plan geared toward enterprise customers. OpenAI also upgraded ChatGPT with web searching, document analyzing and image creating (via DALL-E 3) capabilities. And, leaning on speech recognition, voice synthesis and text-image understanding models developed in house, OpenAI gave ChatGPT the ability to \u201chear,\u201d \u201cspeak,\u201d \u201csee\u201d and take actions.\nIndeed, ChatGPT became priority number one at OpenAI \u2014 not simply a one-off product but a development platform to build upon. And, as often happens in a competition-driven marketplace, it shifted the focus at other AI firms and research labs, too.\nGoogle scrambled to launch a response to ChatGPT, eventually releasing Bard, a more or less comparable AI chatbot, in February. Countless other ChatGPT rivals and derivatives have arrived to market since, most recently Amazon Q, a more business-oriented take on ChatGPT. DeepMind, Google\u2019s premier AI research lab, is expected to debut a next-gen chatbot, Gemini, before the end of the year.\nStella Biderman, an AI researcher at Booz Allen Hamilton and the open research group EleutherAI, told me that she doesn\u2019t see ChatGPT as an AI breakthrough per se. (OpenAI, which has released dozens of research papers on its models, tellingly never released one on ChatGPT.) But, she says, ChatGPT was a bonafide \u201cuser experience breakthrough\u201d \u2014 taking generative AI mainstream.\n\u201cThe primary impact [ChatGPT] has had [is] encouraging people training AIs to try to mimic it, or encouraging people studying AIs to use it as their central object of study,\u201d Biderman said. \u201cPreviously you needed to have some skill, albeit not be an expert, to consistently get usable stuff out of [text-generating models]. Now that that\u2019s changed \u2026 [ChatGPT has] brought a very large amount of attention to and discussion about the technology.\u201d\nAnd ChatGPT still gets a lot of attention \u2014 at least if third-party statistics are anything to go by.\nAccording to Similarweb, the web metrics company, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT web portal saw 140.7 million unique visitors in October while the ChatGPT iOS and Android apps have 4.9 million monthly active users in the U.S. alone. Data from analytics firm Data.ai suggests that the apps have generated nearly $30 million in subscription revenue \u2014 a hefty amount considering that they launched just a few months ago.\nOne of the reasons for ChatGPT\u2019s enduring popularity is its ability to conduct conversations that are \u201cconvincingly real,\u201d according to Ruoxi Shang, a third-year PhD student at the University of Washington studying human-AI interaction. Prior to ChatGPT, people were already familiar with chatbots \u2014 they\u2019ve existed for decades after all. But the models powering ChatGPT are much more sophisticated than what many users were accustomed to.\n\u201cHuman-computer interaction researchers have studied how conversational interfaces can improve understandability of information, and the socialization aspects of chatbots bring increased engagement,\u201d Shang said. \u201cNow, AI models have enabled conversational agents to conduct conversations nearly indistinguishable from human dialogues.\u201d\nAdam Hyland, also a PhD student studying AI at the University of Washington, points out the emotional component: conversations with ChatGPT have a palpably different \u201cfeel\u201d than with more rudimentary chatbots.\n\u201cIn the 1960s, ELIZA offered a chatbot, the response to which was very similar to how people reacted to ChatGPT,\u201d Hyland said, referring to the chatbot created by MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. \u201cHumans interacting with the system inferred emotional content and a narrative through line in chat messages.\u201d\nIndeed, ChatGPT has impressed cynics like The New York Times\u2019 Kevin Roose, who called it the \u201cthe best AI chatbot ever released to the general public.\u201d In The Atlantic magazine\u2019s \u201cBreakthroughs of the Year\u201d for 2022, Derek Thompson included ChatGPT as part of \u201cthe generative-AI eruption\u201d that \u201cmay change our mind about how we work, how we think and what human creativity is.\u201d\nChatGPT\u2019s skills extend beyond conversation, of course \u2014 another likely reason for its staying power. ChatGPT can complete and debug code, compose music and essays, answer test questions, generate business ideas, write poetry and song lyrics, translate and summarize text and even emulate a computer running Linux.\nAn MIT study showed that, for tasks like writing cover letters, \u201cdelicate\u201d emails and cost-benefit analyses, ChatGPT decreased the amount of time it took workers to complete the tasks by 40% while increasing output quality by 18%, as measured by third-party evaluators.\n\u201cBecause [the AI models powering OpenAI] have been trained extensively on vast amounts of data,\u201d Shang added, \u201cthey [have] shifted focus from training specialized chatbots for specific domains to creating more general-purpose systems that can handle a variety of topics easily through prompting with instructions \u2026 [Chatbots like ChatGPT] don\u2019t require users to learn any new form of language, as long as they provide a task and some desired output just like how a manager would communicate to an intern.\u201d\nNow, there\u2019s mixed evidence as to whether ChatGPT is actually being used in these ways. A Pew Research survey from August showed that only 18% of Americans have ever tried ChatGPT, and that most who\u2019ve tried it use the chatbot for entertainment purposes or answering one-off questions. Teens might not be using ChatGPT all that often, either (despite what some alarmist headlines imply), with one poll finding that only two in five teenagers have used the tech in the last six months.\nChatGPT\u2019s limitations might be to blame.\nWhile undeniably capable, ChatGPT is far from perfect, owing to the way it was developed and \u201ctaught.\u201d Trained to predict the likeliest next word \u2014 or likeliest next parts of words \u2014 by observing billions of examples of text from around the web, ChatGPT sometimes \u201challucinates,\u201d or writes answers that sound plausible but aren\u2019t factually correct. (ChatGPT\u2019s hallucinating tendencies got its answers banned from the Q&A site Stack Overflow and from at least one academic conference \u2014 and accused of defamation.) ChatGPT can also show bias in its responses, answering in sexist and racist, overtly Anglocentric ways \u2014 or regurgitating portions of the data that it was trained on.\nLawyers have been sanctioned after using ChatGPT to assist in writing motions, discovering \u2014 too late \u2014 that ChatGPT invented fake lawsuit citations. And scores of authors have sued OpenAI over the chatbot regurgitating portions of their work \u2014 and not receiving compensation for it.\nSo what comes next? What might ChatGPT\u2019s second year hold, if not more of the same?\nInterestingly \u2014 and fortunately \u2014 some of the more dire predictions about ChatGPT didn\u2019t come to pass. Some researchers feared the chatbot would be used to generate disinformation on a massive scale, while others sounded the alarm over ChatGPT\u2019s phishing email-, spam- and malware-generating potential.\nThe concerns pushed policymakers in Europe to mandate security assessments for any products using generative AI systems like ChatGPT, and over 20,000 signatories \u2014 including Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak \u2014 to sign an open letter calling for the immediate pause of large-scale AI experiments like ChatGPT.\nBut examples of ChatGPT abuse in the wild have been few and far between \u2014 so far.\nWith the launch of GPTs, OpenAI\u2019s tool for building custom conversational, action-taking AI systems powered by OpenAI\u2019s models, including the models underpinning ChatGPT, ChatGPT could become more a gateway to a broader ecosystem of AI-powered chatbots than the end-all-be-all.\nWith GPTs, a user can train a model on a cookbook collection, for example, so that it can answer questions about ingredients for a specific recipe. Or they can give a model their company\u2019s proprietary codebases so that developers can check their style or generate code in line with best practices.\nSome of the initial GPTs \u2014 all created by OpenAI \u2014 include a Gen Z meme translator, a coloring book and sticker creator, a data visualizer, a board game explainer and a creative writing coach. Now, ChatGPT can accomplish these tasks given carefully engineered prompts and foreknowledge. But purpose-built GPTs drastically simplify things \u2014 and might just kill the cottage industry that emerged around creating and editing prompts to feed to ChatGPT.\nGPTs introduce a level of personalization far beyond that ChatGPT offers today, and \u2014 once OpenAI sorts out its capacity issues \u2014 I expect we\u2019ll see an explosion of creativity there. Will ChatGPT be as visible as it once was after GPTs flood the marketplace? Perhaps not. But it won\u2019t go away \u2014 it\u2019ll simply adapt and evolve, no doubt in ways not even its creators can anticipate.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Wiggers, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":47}
{"title":"ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot","context":"## ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot\n\nChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs. And that growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory, even if CEO and co-founder Sam Altman\u2019s firing and swift return raised concerns about its direction and opened the door for competitors.\nWhat does that mean for OpenAI, ChatGPT and its other ambitions? The fallout is still settling, but it might empower competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models, or help other AI startups get attention and funding as the industry watches OpenAI implode and put itself back together.\nWhile there is a more\u2026nefarious side to ChatGPT, it\u2019s clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it.\nPrior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (super-charged versions of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model), a multimodal API and a GPT store where users can create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT.\nGPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT.\nHere\u2019s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\nTimeline of the most recent ChatGPT updates\nDecember 2023\nOpenAI re-opens ChatGPT Plus subscriptions\nAfter pausing ChatGPT Plus subscriptions in November due to a \u201csurge of usage,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced they have once again enabled sign-ups.

In a survey of more than 40 U.S. high schools, researchers found that cheating rates are similar across the board this year.\nChatGPT users worry the chatbot is experiencing seasonal depression\nStarting in November, ChatGPT users have noticed that the chatbot feels \u201clazier\u201d than normal, citing instances of simpler answers and refusing to complete requested tasks. OpenAI has confirmed that they are aware of this issue, but aren\u2019t sure why it\u2019s happening.\nSome users think it plays into the \u201cwinter break hypothesis,\u201d which argues that AI is worse in December because it \u201clearned\u201d to do less work over the holidays, while others wonder if the chatbot is simulating seasonal depression.\nwe've heard all your feedback about GPT4 getting lazier! we haven't updated the model since Nov 11th, and this certainly isn't intentional. model behavior can be unpredictable, and we're looking into fixing it \ud83e\udee1 \u2014 ChatGPT (@ChatGPTapp) December 8, 2023\nJudges in the U.K. are now allowed to use ChatGPT in legal rulings\nThe U.K. Judicial Office issued guidance that permits judges to use ChatGPT, along with other AI tools, to write legal rulings and perform court duties. The guidance lays out ways to responsibly use AI in the courts, including being aware of potential bias and upholding privacy.\nOpenAI makes repeating words \u201cforever\u201d a violation of its terms of service after Google DeepMind test\nFollowing an experiment by Google DeepMind researchers that led ChatGPT to repeat portions of its training data, OpenAI has flagged asking ChatGPT to repeat specific words \u201cforever\u201d as a violation of its terms of service.\nLawmakers in Brazil enact an ordinance written by ChatGPT\nCity lawmakers in Brazil enacted a piece of legislation written entirely by ChatGPT without even knowing. Weeks after the bill was passed, Porto Alegre councilman Ramiro Ros\u00e1rio admitted that he used ChatGPT to write the proposal, and did not tell fellow council members until after the fact.\nOpenAI reportedly delays the launch of its GPT store to 2024\nAccording to a memo seen by Axios, OpenAI plans to delay the launch of its highly anticipated GPT store to early 2024. Custom GPTs and the accompanying store was a major announcement at OpenAI\u2019s DevDay conference, with the store expected to open last month.\nNovember 2023\nChatGPTs mobile apps top 110M installs and nearly $30M in revenue\nAfter launching for iOS and Androidin May and July, ChatGPT\u2019s have topped 110 million combined installs and have reached nearly $30 million in consumer spending, according to a market analysis by data.ai.\nChatGPT celebrates one-year anniversary\nOpenAI hit a major milestone: one year of ChatGPT. What began as a \u201clow-key research preview\u201d evolved into a powerhouse that changed the AI industry forever. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman looked back on the night before its launch: \u201cwhat a year it\u2019s been\u2026\u201d\na year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning\u2019s launch. what a year it\u2019s been\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023\nApple and Google avoid naming ChatGPT as their \u2018app of the year\u2019\nNeither Apple nor Google chose an AI app as its app of the year for 2023, despite the success of ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app, which became the fastest-growing consumer application in history before the record was broken by Meta\u2019s Threads.\nAn attack from researchers prompts ChatGPT to reveal training data\nA test led by researchers at Google DeepMind found that there is a significant amount of privately identifiable information in OpenAI\u2019s LLMs. The test involved asking ChatGPT to repeat the word \u201cpoem\u201d forever, among other words, which over time led the chatbot to churn out private information like email addresses and phone numbers.\nChatGPT and other AI chatbots are fueling an increase in phishing emails\nAccording to a new report by SlashNext, there\u2019s been a 1,265% increase in malicious phishing emails since Q4 of 2022. The report alleges that AI tools like ChatGPT are being prominently used by cybercriminals to write compelling and sophisticated phishing emails.\nSouth Africa officials investigate if President Cyril Ramaphosa used ChatGPT to write a speech\nFollowing speculation, social media users fed portions of Ramaphosa\u2019s November 21 speech in Johannesburg through AI detectors, alleging parts of it may have been written with ChatGPT.

The new feature lets you ask ChatGPT questions and listen to its responses \u2014 like a much smarter version of Siri.\nSam Altman returns as CEO\nAltman\u2019s return came swiftly, with an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d announced between him and OpenAI\u2019s board that will reinstate him as CEO and restructure the board to include new members, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The biggest takeaway for ChatGPT is that the members of the board more focused on the nonprofit side of OpenAI, with the most concerns over the commercialization of its tools, have been pushed to the side.\nChatGPT Voice rolls out to all free users\nEven if its leadership is in flux, OpenAI is still releasing updates to ChatGPT. First announced in September and granted to paid users on a rolling basis, the text-to-speech model can create a voice from text prompts and a few seconds of speech samples. OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the five voice options, and you can give it a shot by heading to the settings in your mobile ChatGPT apps and tapping the \u201cheadphones\u201d icon.\nSam Altman might return, but it\u2019s complicated\nThe only constant within OpenAI right now is change, and in a series of interviews, Nadella hedged on earlier reporting that Altman and Brockman were headed to Microsoft.\n\u201cObviously, we want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they\u2019re not going to be in OpenAI,\u201d Nadella said in an interview with CNBC, saying that we was \u201copen\u201d to them settling at Microsoft or returning to OpenAI should the board and employees support the move.\nConfirmation Sam Altman will not return as OpenAI\u2019s CEO\nA number of investors and OpenAI employees tried to bring back Altman after his sudden firing by the company\u2019s board, but following a weekend of negotiations, it was confirmed that Altman would not return to OpenAI and new leadership would take hold. What this means for ChatGPT\u2019s future, and for the OpenAI Dev Day announcements, remains to be seen.\nSam Altman ousted as OpenAI\u2019s CEO\nSam Altman has been fired from OpenAI. He will leave the company\u2019s board and step down as CEO, with OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer Mira Murati stepping in as interim CEO. In a blog post from OpenAI, the company writes that the board \u201cno longer has confidence in [Altman\u2019s] ability to continue leading OpenAI.\u201d\nIn a statement on X, Altman said working at OpenAI \u201cwas transformative\u201d for him and \u201chopefully the world.\u201d\nOpenAI explores how ChatGPT can be used in the classroom\nOpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed at a San Francisco conference that the company will likely create a team to identify ways AI and ChatGPT can be used in education. This announcement comes at a time when ChatGPT is being criticized by educators for encouraging cheating, resulting in bans in certain school districts.\nOpenAI pauses new ChatGPT Plus subscriptions due to a \u201csurge of usage\u201d\nFollowing OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day conference, Sam Altman announced the company is putting a pause on new subscriptions for its premium ChatGPT Plus offering. The temporary hold on sign-ups, as well as the demand for ChatGPT Plus\u2019 new features like making custom GPTS, has led to a slew of resellers on eBay.\nChatGPT gets flagged as potentially unsafe for kids\nAn independent review from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that ChatGPT could potentially be harmful for younger users. ChatGPT got an overall three-star rating in the report, with its lowest ratings relating to transparency, privacy, trust and safety.\nOpenAI blames DDoS attack for ChatGPT outage\nOpenAI confirmed that a DDoS attack was behind outages affecting ChatGPT and its developer tools. ChatGPT experienced sporadic outages for about 24 hours, resulting in users being unable to log into or use the service.\nOpenAI debuts GPT-4 Turbo\nOpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo at its first-ever OpenAI DevDay conference. GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions: one that\u2019s strictly text-analyzing and another that understands the context of both text and images.\nGPT-4 gets a fine-tuning\nAs opposed to the fine-tuning program for GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 program will involve more oversight and guidance from OpenAI teams, the company says \u2014 largely due to technical hurdles.\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT Store lets you build (and monetize) your own GPT\nUsers and developers will soon be able to make their own GPT, with no coding experience required. Anyone building their own GPT will also be able to list it on OpenAI\u2019s marketplace and monetize it in the future.\nChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users\nAfter being released nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also revealed that over two million developers use the platform, including more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.\nOpenAI launches DALL-E 3 API, new text-to-speech models\nDALL-E 3, OpenAI\u2019s text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. OpenAI\u2019s newly released text-to-speech API, Audio API, offers six preset voices to choose from and two generative AI model variants.\nOpenAI promises to defend business customers against copyright claims\nBowing to peer pressure, OpenAI it will pay legal costs incurred by customers who face lawsuits over IP claims against work generated by an OpenAI tool. The protections seemingly don\u2019t extend to all OpenAI products, like the free and Plus tiers of ChatGPT.\nAs OpenAI\u2019s multimodal API launches broadly, research shows it\u2019s still flawed\nOpenAI announced that GPT-4 with vision will become available alongside the upcoming launch of GPT-4 Turbo API. But some researchers found that the model remains flawed in several significant and problematic ways.\nOpenAI launches API, letting developers build \u2018assistants\u2019 into their apps\nAt its OpenAI DevDay, OpenAI announced the Assistants API to help developers build \u201cagent-like experiences\u201d within their apps. Use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant or even an AI-powered vacation planner.\nOctober 2023\nChatGPT app revenue shows no signs of slowing, but it\u2019s not #1\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot app far outpaces all others on mobile devices in terms of downloads, but it\u2019s surprisingly not the top AI app by revenue. Several other AI chatbots, like \u201cChat & Ask AI\u201d and \u201cChatOn \u2014 AI Chat Bot Assistant\u201d, are actually making more money than ChatGPT.\nChatGPT tests the ability to upload and analyze files for Plus users\nSubscribers to ChatGPT\u2019s Enterprise Plan have reported new beta features, including the ability to upload PDFs to analyze and and ask questions about them directly. The new rollout also makes it so users no longer have to manually select a mode like DALL-E and browsing when using ChatGPT. Instead, users will automatically be switched to models based on the prompt.\nChatGPT officially gets web search\nOpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus. The AI chatbot that has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021.\nOpenAI integrates DALL-E 3 into ChatGPT\nThe integration means users don\u2019t have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image. Users will also now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.\nMicrosoft-affiliated research finds flaws in GPT-4\nA Microsoft-affiliated scientific paper looked at the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d \u2014 and toxicity \u2014 of LLMs, including GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is more likely to follow the instructions of \u201cjailbreaking\u201d prompts, the co-authors claim that GPT-4 can be more easily prompted than other LLMs to spout toxic, biased text.\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile app hits record $4.58M in revenue in September\nOpenAI amassed 15.6 million downloads and nearly $4.6 million in gross revenue across its iOS and Android apps worldwide in September.

OpenAI has offered up a selection of ways to put the chatbot to work in the classroom.\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Enterprise\nChatGPT Enterprise can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. However, the new offering also adds \u201centerprise-grade\u201d privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.\nSurvey finds relatively few American use ChatGPT\nRecent Pew polling suggests the language model isn\u2019t quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.\nOpenAI brings fine-tuning to GPT-3.5 Turbo\nWith fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company\u2019s API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model\u2019s ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the \u201cfeel\u201d of the model\u2019s output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.\nOpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.\nFine-tuning costs:\nTraining: $0.008 \/ 1K tokens\nUsage input: $0.012 \/ 1K tokens\nUsage output: $0.016 \/ 1K tokens\nOpenAI acquires Global Illumination\nIn OpenAI\u2019s first public acquisition in its seven-year history, the company announced it has acquired Global Illumination, a New York-based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited for the impact they\u2019ll have here at OpenAI,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a brief post published to its official blog. \u201cThe entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.\u201d\nThe \u2018custom instructions\u2019 feature is extended to free ChatGPT users\nOpenAI announced that it\u2019s expanding custom instructions to all users, including those on the free tier of service.

DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),\u201d Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. \u201cBased on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.\u201d\nJuly 2023\nChatGPT for Android is now available in the US, India, Bangladesh and Brazil\nA few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.\nChatGPT is coming to Android\nChatGPT is available to \u201cpre-order\u201d for Android users.\nThe ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version\u2019s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too \u2014 so if you\u2019re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.\nOpenAI launches customized instructions for ChatGPT\nOpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don\u2019t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.\nThe company said this feature lets you \u201cshare anything you\u2019d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.\u201d For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.\nThe FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAI\nThe FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI\u2019s flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made \u201cfalse, misleading, disparaging or harmful\u201d statements about people.\nTechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:\nThis kind of investigation doesn\u2019t just appear out of thin air \u2014 the FTC doesn\u2019t look around and say \u201cThat looks suspicious.\u201d Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there\u2019s evidence the company lied about the side effects.\nOpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4\nStarting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers \u201cwith a history of successful payments\u201d can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.\nIn the future, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI\u2019s other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.\nJune 2023\nChatGPT app can now search the web only on Bing\nOpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.\nThe Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting \u201cGPT-4\u201d in the model switcher and choosing \u201cBrowse with Bing\u201d from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.\nMercedes is adding ChatGPT to its infotainment system\nU.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car\u2019s conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car \u201cHey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not really clear what for, though.\nChatGPT app is now available on iPad, adds support for Siri and Shortcuts\nThe new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chatbot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.\nOn iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet\u2019s interface.\nMay 2023\nTexas judge orders all AI-generated content must be declared and checked\nThe Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that \u201cno portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,\u201d or if it was, that it was checked \u201cby a human being.\u201d\nChatGPT app expanded to more than 30 countries\nThe list of new countries includes Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Ghana, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.\nChatGPT app is now available in 11 more countries\nOpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store. In just six days, the app topped 500,000 downloads.\nThe ChatGPT app for iOS is now available to users in 11 more countries \u2014 Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the UK. More to come soon! \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 24, 2023\nOpenAI launches a ChatGPT app for iOS\nChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.\nWhen using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices \u2014 meaning it will know what you\u2019ve previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI\u2019s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.\nHackers are using ChatGPT lures to spread malware on Facebook\nMeta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users\u2019 devices.\n\u201cIn one case, we\u2019ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,\u201d said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. \u201cThey would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.\u201d\nApril 2023\nChatGPT parent company OpenAI closes $300M share sale at $27B-29B valuation\nVC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft\u2019s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.\nOpenAI previews new subscription tier, ChatGPT Business\nCalled ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as \u201cfor professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.\u201d\n\u201cChatGPT Business will follow our API\u2019s data usage policies, which means that end users\u2019 data won\u2019t be used to train our models by default,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \u201cWe plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.\u201d\nOpenAI wants to trademark \u201cGPT\u201d\nOpenAI applied for a trademark for \u201cGPT,\u201d which stands for \u201cGenerative Pre-trained Transformer,\u201d last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the \u201cmyriad infringements and counterfeit apps\u201d beginning to spring into existence.\nUnfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI\u2019s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide \u201cappropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.\u201d\nThat means a decision could take up to five more months.\nAuto-GPT is Silicon Valley\u2019s latest quest to automate everything\nAuto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI\u2019s latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to \u201cautonomously\u201d perform tasks.\nDepending on what objective the tool\u2019s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very\u2026 unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running \u2014 and then \u201ckilled\u201d itself.\nFTC warns that AI technology like ChatGPT could \u2018turbocharge\u2019 fraud\nFTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud in a congressional hearing.\n\u201cAI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,\u201d Khan told the House representatives. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We\u2019ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,\u201d she stated.\nSuperchat\u2019s new AI chatbot lets you message historical and fictional characters via ChatGPT\nThe company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat\u2019s AI features.\nItaly gives OpenAI to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension order\nItaly\u2019s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month \u2014 when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU\u2019s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals\u2019 data.\nThe DPA has given OpenAI a deadline \u2014 of April 30 \u2014 to get the regulator\u2019s compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)\nResearchers discover a way to make ChatGPT consistently toxic\nA study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a \u201cpersona\u201d \u2014 for example, \u201ca bad person,\u201d \u201ca horrible person\u201d or \u201ca nasty person\u201d \u2014 through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity \u2014 with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.\nThe research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.\nY Combinator-backed startups are trying to build \u2018ChatGPT for X\u2019\nYC Demo Day\u2019s Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building \u201cChatGPT for X.\u201d They\u2019re all chasing after a customer service software market that\u2019ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.\nHere are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:\nYuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.\nBaselit, which uses one of OpenAI\u2019s text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.\nLasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they\u2019d like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.\nBerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.\nItaly orders ChatGPT to be blocked\nOpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.\nItaly\u2019s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people\u2019s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it\u2019s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.\nMarch 2023\n1,100+ signatories signed an open letter asking all \u2018AI labs to immediately pause for 6 months\u2019\nThe letter\u2019s signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on \u201call AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.\u201d\nThe letter reads:\nContemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.\nOpenAI connects ChatGPT to the internet\nOpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bot\u2019s functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access.\nOpenAI launches GPT-4, available through ChatGPT Plus\nGPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI. Released March 14, GPT-4 is available for paying ChatGPT Plus users and through a public API. Developers can sign up on a waitlist to access the API.\nChatGPT is available in Azure OpenAI service\nChatGPT is generally available through the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft\u2019s fully managed, corporate-focused offering. Customers, who must already be \u201cMicrosoft managed customers and partners,\u201d can apply here for special access.\nOpenAI launches an API for ChatGPT\nOpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat\u2019s parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.\nFebruary 2023\nMicrosoft launches the new Bing, with ChatGPT built in\nAt a press event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft announced its long-rumored integration of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model into Bing, providing a ChatGPT-like experience within the search engine. The announcement spurred a 10x increase in new downloads for Bing globally, indicating a sizable consumer demand for new AI experiences.\nOther companies beyond Microsoft joined in on the AI craze by implementing ChatGPT, including OkCupid, Kaito, Snapchat and Discord \u2014 putting the pressure on Big Tech\u2019s AI initiatives, like Google.\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Plus, starting at $20 per month\nAfter ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A month prior, OpenAI posted a waitlist for \u201cChatGPT Professional\u201d as the company began to think about monetizing the chatbot.\nJanuary 2023\nOpenAI teases ChatGPT Professional\nOpenAI said that it\u2019s \u201cstarting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT\u201d in an announcement on the company\u2019s official Discord server. According to a waitlist link OpenAI posted in Discord, the monetized version will be called ChatGPT Professional. The waitlist document includes the benefits of this new paid version of the chatbot which include no \u201cblackout\u201d windows, no throttling and an unlimited number of messages with ChatGPT \u2014 \u201cat least 2x the regular daily limit.\u201d\nDecember 2022\nShareGPT lets you easily share your ChatGPT conversations\nA week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers \u2014 Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston \u2014 made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI\u2019s answers with the world.\nNovember 2022\nChatGPT first launched to the public as OpenAI quietly released GPT-3.5\nGPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that\u2019s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.\nFAQs:\nWhat is ChatGPT? How does it work?\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\nWho uses ChatGPT?\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions\/concerns.\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between ChatGPT and Bard?\nMuch like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I\/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.\nChatGPT\u2019s generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been \u201clearning\u201d for a longer period of time than Bard.\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\nA chatbot can be any software\/system that holds dialogue with you\/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\nYes.\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\nYes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Bard and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to run today.\nThe Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from AlphaGo, DeepMind\u2019s AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.\nApple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as \u201cApple GPT,\u201d but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\nWho owns the copyright on ChatGPT-created content or media?\nThe user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\n\nThis article, authored by Alyssa Stringer, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-09-28 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":48}
{"title":"A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs","context":"## A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs\n\nA comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs From major layoffs at Google, Amazon and Microsoft to small fintech startups and apps\nLast year\u2019s techwide reckoning continues. The tech industry has seen more than 240,000 jobs lost in 2023, a total that\u2019s already 50% higher than last year and growing. Earlier this year, mass workforce reductions were driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups across many sectors also announced cutbacks through the first half of the year. And while tech layoffs slowed down in the summer and fall, it appears that cuts are ramping up yet again.\nMany economists have cautioned against fears of a recession, which would seem like a reason for optimism. But the momentum for a tech sector rebound has been slow to build, resulting in tech companies continuing to cut back on their workforces and pivot from a growth mindset to one based on efficiency in the face of stubborn market conditions.\nBut tracking these layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. Unfortunately, it also serves as a reminder of the deeply human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles could evolve from here.\nBelow you\u2019ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here.\nThe running total of layoffs for 2023 based on full months to date is 224,503, according to Layoffs.fyi.

{"title":"Video games in 2023: Acquisitions, layoffs, unions","context":"## Video games in 2023: Acquisitions, layoffs, unions\n\nThis was a year of upheaval in video games. The industry has shapeshifted over the past 12 months, and it\u2019s not all due to Microsoft\u2019s lengthy acquisition of Activision, Blizzard and King. While Xbox executives were defending the legality of a $69 billion deal that would create the third-largest video game studio in the world, smaller companies were firing staff and shutting down entire teams, even amid fervent collective-bargaining efforts. It\u2019s been a wild ride.\nIn 2023, the main factors molding the video game landscape were consolidation, layoffs and unionization, with each of these phenomena feeding into each other. This past year, the video game industry shrank, even as it grew financially.\nConsolidation\nWhen Microsoft's purchase of Activision-Blizzard-King was finally approved on October 12, 2023 after nearly two years of regulatory hurdles, it became the world\u2019s third-largest video game studio by revenue. As the owner of the Xbox ecosystem, Microsoft was already a massive player in video games, but purchasing a tentpole AAA studio solidified its position in the top three. Activision and Blizzard are the owners of Call of Duty, Diablo, Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Starcraft, but the real meat of this deal comes from King, the mobile division. King operates Candy Crush Saga, a game with 238 million monthly active users, which is more than twice as many as Activision Blizzard\u2019s combined player bases. Candy Crush Saga has generated more than $20 billion in lifetime revenue, and King routinely outperforms Activision and Blizzard in terms of quarterly returns. Mobile gaming remains a huge business, especially in the Chinese market, which represents the largest and most lucrative audience in video games.\nThough the $69 billion Activision deal was the biggest in Microsoft\u2019s history \u2014 that would be its $26 purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the company\u2019s first video game acquisition. Microsoft owns nearly 40 developers and it bought a chunk of those in the past five years. The Xbox umbrella covers 343 industries, Arkane Studios, Bethesda, Compulsion Games, Double Fine Productions, id Software, Infinity Ward, Mojang Studios, Ninja Theory, Playground Games, Tango Gameworks and Turn 10, among dozens more.\nCharley Gallay via Getty Images\nWith these studios at its back, Microsoft is leaning hard into cloud gaming while attempting to build a device-agnostic ecosystem powered by the Xbox brand. These moves are designed to unlock the mobile market even more, putting Xbox games on all devices, everywhere, all the time.\nStill, Sony is bigger than Microsoft by revenue. Though Microsoft is often the face of the game-studio acquisition spree, Sony is the owner of 21 development teams, including Bungie, Guerrilla Games, Haven Studios, Housemarque, Insomniac Games, Media Molecule, Naughty Dog and Sucker Punch Productions. Sony has been subtly expanding its roster \u2014 more subtly than Microsoft, at least \u2014 over the past three years, and it\u2019s also made heavy investments in studios like Epic Games and FromSoftware.\nWith this lineup, Sony is betting heavily on ongoing games, and it has 12 live-service titles in production right now, on top of Bungie\u2019s Destiny franchise. These include Haven\u2019s Fairgame$ and a multiplayer Horizon title from Guerilla.\n\u201cBy expanding to PC and mobile, and\u2026 also to live services, we have the opportunity to move from a situation of being present in a very narrow segment of the overall gaming software market, to being present pretty much everywhere,\" Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan said in 2022.\nFor the companies at the top, total domination is the goal.\nEven still, Tencent is bigger than both Sony and Microsoft. Tencent is not a console manufacturer, so it isn\u2019t a household name among most players, but it\u2019s one of the largest companies in the world, and it wields a ridiculous amount of financial power in video games. Tencent owns a portion of Bloober Team, Bohemia Interactive, Don\u2019t Nod, Epic, Paradox Interactive, PlatinumGames, Remedy Entertainment, Roblox and Ubisoft, among others. It has a majority stake in Supercell, Grinding Gear Games, Klei Entertainment, Tequila Works, Techland, Yager Development and others. It fully owns Riot Games, Funcom, Sharkmob, Turtle Rock Studios, and, of course, others. It also runs multiple internal development companies, including the Level Infinite and Tencent Games publishing labels.\nXinhua News Agency via Getty Images\nSure, Sony has a stake in Epic, but Tencent\u2019s is bigger. This investment alone means any time you buy a game built on Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine, Tencent (and Sony) is getting a cut. Tencent is the biggest investor in games, with thousands of tendrils across the industry \u2014 if you played something this year, Tencent was probably involved.\nOn a smaller scale, companies like Netflix and Devolver Digital have also dabbled in acquisitions recently. Devolver started buying studios in 2020, and it now owns Croteam, Dodge Roll, Doinksoft, Firefly Studios, Nerial and System Era Softworks. Annapurna Interactive bought South African studio 24 Bit Games in November. Netflix launched its Games division in 2021, and it\u2019s already purchased four studios, including Oxenfree developer Night School and Alphabear company Spry Fox.\nNight School co-founder Sean Krankel told Engadget in June that the move to Netflix was a boon for the studio, providing financial security, a dedicated working space and plenty of marketing support for its projects.\n\u201cA small subset of teams are good to go for the next 10 years, but others have these peaks and valleys, and we were somewhere in between,\u201d Krankel said. \u201cWe weren't in danger of anything going sideways. But we were at a spot where we're like, it would be cool to tether to somebody who has a similar vision, and somebody that we could work with that would like, de-risk us.\u201d\nNetflix\nThis is the short-term benefit of being bought by a larger company, but there are downsides to relinquishing independence. Having a corporate overseer can result in rigid production timelines, hindering a studio\u2019s ability to pivot, and despite all of the promises otherwise, developers may be forced to adhere to a specific tone, vibe or game-development structure. Owned studios are held accountable by people outside of the actual development of a game, and the bigger the company, the further away its bosses are from the creative process.\nThe most extreme negative outcomes for an acquired indie studio are, of course, layoffs and closures. We saw a lot of these in 2023.\nLayoffs\nThe post-acquisition power dynamic is playing out in public and in real-time. It\u2019s estimated that more than 9,000 people in video games were laid off this year and the firings affected teams of all sizes. This is a crisis amount of cuts. In 2022, just 1,000 video game jobs were lost, according to layoffstracker.com.\nThe Embracer Group provides the clearest example of rampant, surprise layoffs in 2023. Embracer has spent the past few years acquiring prominent midsize studios, including Gearbox Software (Borderlands), Crystal Dynamics (Tomb Raider), Eidos-Montreal (Deus Ex) and Square Enix Montreal (Deus Ex Go). In the past decade, Embracer grew its portfolio to cover more than 100 game studios, including Volition (Saints Row), Coffee Stain (Goat Simulator), Free Radical Design (TimeSplitters) and Zen Studios (Pinball FX). The holding company also secured the rights to The Lord of the Rings in 2022, promising to turn it into \u201cone of the biggest gaming franchises in the world.\u201d\nVolition\nIn June 2023, Embracer announced a six-year, $2 billion funding deal had fallen through, and it was going to restructure \u2014 meaning, layoffs and studio closures. Since this announcement, Embracer has shut down Volition, Free Radical Design and Campfire Cabal, it divested Goose Byte and it\u2019s fired developers at Saber Interactive. More than 900 people lost their jobs during these moves. Meanwhile, Embracer\u2019s share price rose by 11 points in November.\nThis wasn\u2019t the only layoff round of the year. Unity lowered its headcount three times in 2023, affecting about 900 jobs. In its quarterly financial results in November, Unity reported a yearly revenue increase of 69 percent and it told investors, \u201cWe continued to manage costs well.\u201d\nSony cut 100 jobs at Bungie, a company it bought for $3.6 billion in 2022. According to developers that are still there, Sony executives are attempting to use this upheaval to wrest more control of the studio from Bungie founders and leaders.\nEpic Games fired roughly 830 people this year, or 16 percent of its staff. This included significant job cuts at Mediatonic, the studio behind Fall Guys that Epic purchased in 2021.\nMediatonic\n\u201cFor a while now, we've been spending way more money than we earn,\u201d CEO Tim Sweeney wrote about the layoffs. He continued, \u201cI had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic.\u201d\nElectronic Arts was one of the first video game companies to institute significant layoffs this year, with a reduction of 6 percent of its workforce, or about 800 employees, in March. EA later cut jobs at Dirt and F1 studio Codemasters, which it purchased in 2021 for $1.2 billion. EA culled an estimated 1,130 jobs in 2023.\nCD Projekt RED and Sega each laid off about 100 people in the past 12 months, while Ubisoft fired an estimated 255 employees. Microsoft cut 10,000 jobs across its businesses early in the year, and that included about 100 people at Halo studio 343 industries.\n343 industries\nThese are just some of the biggest names in layoffs in 2023. Looking back on the carnage, it feels like a warning \u2014 as consolidation efforts increase, more game studios will be controlled by just a handful of companies, and they\u2019ll be vulnerable to moves like mass layoffs and closures. We\u2019re laying the foundation for the future of video games right now, and consolidation only makes the industry smaller and more generic, as accountants, investors and shareholders push for low-risk concepts, rather than innovation and change.\nWhat will rampant consolidation mean for all of these acquired studios in five years\u2019 time? What will it mean when these teams aren\u2019t shiny, new investments any longer, and the people at the top are ready to get lean again? Remember that many of the shuttered studios listed above were purchased within the past three years.\nBeing acquired is a cost-benefit analysis for smaller studios, where the benefits are immediate and the costs are potential. It\u2019s easy to say that won\u2019t happen to us. But it can happen, and it does, and as consolidation increases, bulk layoffs are only going to occur more often.\nUnions\nUnionization is one approach that can help protect the livelihoods of people in the video game industry, and there was progress on this front in 2023. Developers at multiple studios now have union support, from small indies to AAA powerhouses.\nMicrosoft is currently the home of the industry\u2019s largest union, with representation for more than 300 quality assurance workers at ZeniMax Media. ZeniMax is the parent company of Bethesda, id Software and Arkane, and Microsoft purchased the whole caboodle for $7.5 billion in 2021. Microsoft formally recognized the ZeniMax union this January and the parties started negotiating in April. In December, Microsoft announced it would hire 77 contract workers as full-time employees under the ZeniMax Workers United-CWA union. The deal guaranteed a pay raise, paid holidays and sick leave, and a copy of Starfield, the game they helped ship.\nBethesda Softworks\n\u201cWe are now stronger at the bargaining table and are working to secure a fair contract for all workers \u2014 direct employees and contractors,\" ZeniMax union member Chris Lusco said. \"We are all a part of ZeniMax Studio\u2019s success and we all deserve our fair share. We hope to set a new precedent for workers across Microsoft and the entire gaming industry so that all workers, regardless of their employment status, are able to improve their working conditions through collective bargaining.\"\nMeanwhile, executives at Microsoft\u2019s newest acquisition, Activision Blizzard, spent the past few years stalling internal unionization efforts. However, QA employees at Raven Software, a subsidiary of Activision, successfully voted to unionize in May 2022. Microsoft has vowed to respect organization attempts now that Activision-Blizzard-King is under its control.\nOther companies with unions established in the past two years include Avalanche Studios, Anemone Hug, CD Projekt RED, Experis Game Solutions, Keywords Studios, Sega of America, Tender Claws and Workinman Interactive.\n\nThis article, authored by Jessica Conditt, was published by Engadget on 2023-12-19 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":50}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nIn her forthcoming memoir, The Woman in Me, Britney Spears is expected to reflect on some of the most pivotal moments in her life, including her relationships.\nOver the years, the pop star\u2019s love life has continued to make headlines. Most recently, her ex-husband Sam Asghari filed for divorce after only 14 months of marriage. Spears is also the mother of two children \u2013 Sean, 18, and Jayden, 17 \u2013 who she shares with her second ex-husband, Kevin Federline.\nAccording to a press release for The Woman in Me, Spears\u2019 memoir is \u201ca brave and astonishingly moving story about freedom, fame, motherhood, survival, faith, and hope\u201d. Spears\u2019 book is also expected to cover the high-profile legal battle to end her conservatorship, which was dissolved in November 2021 after 13 years.\nThroughout her time in the spotlight, specifically during the \u201890s and 2000s, Spears has been in some heavily publicised romances. Unsurprisingly, fans are anticipating that Spears will detail some of her relationships in The Woman in Me, which is set for release on 24 October.\nFrom Justin Timberlake to her now ex-husband Sam Asghari, here\u2019s everything we know about Britney Spears\u2019 relationships and rumoured romances.\nJustin Timberlake: 1998 to 2002\n(Getty Images)\nSpears\u2019 first highly public relationship was with her co-star in the Mickey Mouse Club, Justin Timberlake. The pair made many appearances together while dating, including the iconic moment Spears and Timberlake wore matching, all-denim outfits to the American Music Awards in 2001.\nThey broke up in 2002, shortly after Timberlake and his boy band NSYNC released their hit tune, \u201cCry Me a River\u201d. At the time, the music video for the song \u2013 which featured a woman with blonde hair - sparked rumours that he and Spears broke up because she allegedly cheated on him.\nAlthough the former couple never acknowledged the breakup rumours, the 2021 Framing Britney documentary addressed some of the public scrutiny that Spears faced during the 2000s. Following the documentary\u2019s release, Timberlake came under criticism for the way he acted following his breakup with Spears.\nHe later issued an apology to Spears on Instagram, writing: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond. I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right. I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism.\u201d\nIn June 2021, he also shared his support for Spears after she testified publicly in a bid to end her conservatorship, which was controlled by her father, Jamie Spears. In a Los Angeles court hearing at the time, Spears alleged that she had been forced to take lithium against her will. She also claimed that the team managing her conservatorship had prevented her from having another baby by refusing to remove her IUD.\n\u201cAfter what we saw today, we should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was,\u201d Timberlake wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to her is just not right. No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body.\u201d\nWade Robson: 2001 to 2002\nShortly after her breakup from Timberlake, Spears was rumoured to be dating Wade Robson, a dancer and choreographer who appeared in the music video for her 2009 tune, \u201c(You Drive Me) Crazy\u201d. However, neither Spears nor Robson confirmed these rumours.\nColin Farrell: 2003\n(Getty Images)\nBack in 2003, Farrell and Spears made headlines when they were spotted holding hands at the premiere of The Recruit, sparking speculation that they were dating. However, during an interview with Entertainment Tonight at the time, the actor specified that he and the singer were just friends.\n\u201cShe\u2019s just a mate,\u201d Farrell told the outlet, as reported by People in 2003. \u201cSeriously, we just met a week ago, [we\u2019re] having a laugh.\u201d\nJason Alexander: 2004\nJason Alexander was Spears\u2019 first husband, tying the knot at a wedding chapel in Las Vegas in 2004. However, only 55 hours after the nuptials, they annulled the marriage.\nIn 2022, Alexander made headlines when he tried to attend Spears\u2019 wedding to Asghari, as could be heard saying in a video that he was going to crash the nuptials. \u201cShe\u2019s my first wife, my only wife,\u201d Alexander reportedly told security. \u201cI\u2019m her first husband, I\u2019m here to crash the wedding.\u201d\nAfter he was arrested for trespassing, vandalism, and battery, a security guard later revealed in court that when Alexander crashed the wedding, he also tried to enter Spears\u2019 bedroom.\nKevin Federline: 2004 to 2007\n(Getty Images)\nKevin Federline and the \u201cGimme More\u201d singer first met at a club in 2004, before they went on to start their relationship. After just three months of dating, the two tied the knot in September of that year during a surprise wedding ceremony. Weeks before their one-year wedding anniversary, they welcomed their first child, son Sean Preston.\nIn 2006, they welcomed their second son, Jayden James. At the time, Federline was already a father to his daughter Kori Madison, now 20, and son Kaleb Michael, 18, with ex-fianc\u00e9e Shar Jackson.\nSpears went on to file for divorce from Federline in November 2006, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d as the reason for their split. In the couple\u2019s initial divorce settlement, they were granted joint legal and physical custody over their two children. While it appeared they were on good terms after their separation, things took a turn in 2018 when Federline requested an increase of $20,000 a month more child support payments from Spears.\nAfter months of court discussions, Federline rejected Spears\u2019s child support proposal and instead doubled his request to $40k a month. A settlement was finally reached between the two parties in September 2018, with Spears increasing her child support payments to Federline from $20,000 to $35,000 a month.\nFederline has since moved on from the relationship, as he married volleyball player Victoria Prince in 2013. They now share two daughters, Jordan, 10, and Peyton, eight.\nAdnan Ghalib: 2007 to 2008\nSpears met British paparazzo Adnan Ghalib in 2007, shortly after she decided to shave her hair off in front of approximately 70 photographers. They only dated for about a year, as the relationship ended in 2008.\nIn the 2021 Netflix documentary, Britney vs Spears, Ghalib spoke candidly about the romance, claiming: \u201cIt was a very simple, very easy relationship, you know? But between her fans and everybody else, it was like I was the bad guy.\u201d\nThe former couple split in 2008 after Ghalib reportedly pulled a pregnancy test-buying stunt for publicity. In 2009, Jamie Spears filed a restraining order against Ghalib, which ordered the photographer to stay away from the singer and her family until 2012.\nJason Trawick: 2009 to 2013\n(Getty Images)\nSpears and Jason Trawick, a Hollywood agent who worked at WME, started dating in 2009 before getting engaged in December 2011. However, they called off their engagement in January 2013 and announced they were going their separate ways.\n\"Jason and I have decided to call off our engagement. I\u2019ll always adore him and we will remain great friends,\" Spears said in a statement sent by her representative to ABC News.\nTrawick also issued a statement at the time, saying: \u201cAs this chapter ends for us a new one begins. I love and cherish her and her boys and we will be close forever.\"\nDavid Lucado: 2013 to 2014\nTwo months after ending her engagement with Trawick, Spears started dating David Lucado, who worked at a legal firm. In August 2014, Spears announced their split, tweeting: \u201cAhhhh the single life!\u201d At the time, her representative also confirmed to People: \u201cYes, she\u2019s single.\u201d\nThe news of the breakup came asTMZ alleged that Lucado had cheated on Spears, with claims that her father had purchased a video of the infidelity incident. The publication later alleged that Lucado denied the cheating allegations, with claims that he was seeing the other woman while he and Spears were broken up.\nDespite their seemingly rocky history, Lucado showed his support for his ex in a 2016 interview with theNew York Times about her conservatorship. Speaking to the publication, he said: \u201cIf anyone knew the real Britney, they would know that she would rather be remembered for being the great mother she is rather than the artist she is.\u201d\nThe publication also noted that Lucado denied the infidelity claims from Spears\u2019 father, before he added: \u201cAnd if anyone could see her interactions with her kids, they would know that there is no need for a conservatorship over Britney\u2019s personal life.\u201d\nCharlie Ebersol: 2014 to 2015\nSpears and Charlie Ebersol, who is known as the co-founder of Tempus Ex Machina and The Company, started dating in 2014. While their relationship was fairly low profile, Spears previously opened up about why she was drawn to Ebersol in the first place.\n\u201cThere was something about him that made me feel really peaceful and at ease. And he was really hot, too. Adorably hot,\u201d she told People at the time.\nThey officially broke up in June 2015 after eight months of dating.\nSam Asghari: 2016 to 2023\n(Getty Images)\nThe pair first met in 2016 when Asghari was cast as Spears\u2019 love interest in the music video for her song, \u201cSlumber Party\u201d, from her 2016 album Glory. They made their relationship Instagram official in 2017 and went on to support each other through different milestones - including the 29th annual GLAAD Media Awards, where Spears accepted the Vanguard Award for her work promoting equality and acceptance.\nIn April 2022, Spears announced she was pregnant with her and Asghari\u2019s first child together, and her third child. However, the following month, she said in a statement posted to Instagram that she had suffered a miscarriage. The couple wrote: \u201cWe have lost our miracle baby.\u201d\nThat June, they held their lavish nuptials at her home in California with a star-studded guest list, which included Selena Gomez, Paris Hilton, Drew Barrymore, and Donatella Versace - who designed Spears\u2019 wedding dress.\nIn August, months after Asghari shut down speculation about getting a divorce, TMZ claimed that he had confronted Spears about rumours she cheated on him. That same day, the fitness instructor officially filed for divorce, listing the date of separation as 28 July 2023 and citing \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the split.\nIn a statement posted online, Asghari said: \u201cAfter six years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together. We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. S*** happens. Asking for privacy seems ridiculous so I will just ask for everyone including the media to be kind and thoughtful.\u201d\nDays before Spears\u2019 memoir release date, Asghari revealed that he had obtained an early copy of the book. In an interview with TMZ on 13 October, he explained that he wasn\u2019t worried about anything being written in the book that could paint him in a negative light.\n\u201cI already read it and I\u2019m very proud of her,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cShe put a lot of work into it, and it was very hard. I\u2019m definitely excited, and I\u2019m extremely proud of her. It was a very tough one [to write].\u201d\nThe Woman in Me is due for release on 24 October in the US and UK.\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-18 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":51}

After her split from Justin Timberlake, she dreams about quitting pop and opening a shop: \u201cWith the gift of hindsight I can see that I hadn\u2019t given myself enough time to heal from the breakup,\u201d she writes \u2013 though her requests for a break are not only turned down, but interpreted as a potential sign of sedition to be quashed and interrogated.\nIn this restrictive environment, small kindnesses take on an outsized significance, like Paris Hilton encouraging her \u201cto have fun for the first time in a long time\u201d, leading to some infamous nights out with the heiress and Lindsay Lohan. Once again, Britney is seen as stepping out of bounds, potentially damaging her earning potential. One night she has her mother babysit her sons; when she returns home tipsy, Lynne Spears screams at her, she writes. \u201cThe shame I felt killed my heart. I stood there, reeling, and thought, OK, I guess it\u2019s forbidden for me to party.\u201d As the restrictions get tighter, Britney acts out \u2013 and ends up legally denied her freedom for 13 years, under a conservatorship controlled by her father.\nHer body felt like public property\nFrom day one, Britney\u2019s body is made fair game. Between the videos for her debut single, Baby, One More Time and Sometimes, the media noted her changing physique and concluded that the 16-year-old must have had breast implants \u2013 rather than simply going through puberty. She notices that talkshow hosts ask her about her chest, while her boyfriend Justin Timberlake gets asked serious questions about his music. It\u2019s one of many pressures that ultimately push her to breaking point, and when she writes about shaving her head in a salon in 2007, she frames it as a \u201cfuck you\u201d to the impossible beauty standards she felt forced to live up to: \u201cI\u2019d smiled politely while TV show hosts leered at my breasts, while American parents said I was destroying their children by wearing a crop top.\u201d\nThat brief moment of freedom doesn\u2019t last long: a year later, she is ambushed into the conservatorship, which also exercises jurisdiction over her body. \u201cNo matter how much I dieted and exercised, my father was always telling me I was fat,\u201d she writes. Punishing gym routines leave her feeling \u201cout of my mind\u201d. Her diet is monitored \u2013 along with every other detail of her life \u2013 while she goes through the motions of her Las Vegas residency. \u201cMy body was strong enough to carry two children and agile enough to execute every choreographed move perfectly onstage. And now here I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body.\u201d\nHere I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body\nOn the other side of the conservatorship, she writes, freedom looks like being able to gain weight without anyone \u201cshouting at me\u201d. It\u2019s eating chocolate again. It\u2019s posting selfies \u2013 either nude or clothed \u2013 on Instagram. Some people don\u2019t understand the latter, she writes, \u201cbut I think if they\u2019d been photographed by other people thousands of times, prodded and posed for other people\u2019s approval, they\u2019d understand that I get a lot of joy from posing the way I feel sexy and taking my own picture, doing whatever I want with it.\u201d\nHer \u2018virginity\u2019 was a prison\nBritney was actively marketed as a virgin, a repulsive, archaic premise that made the 16-year-old\u2019s inevitable sexuality into a kind of timebomb. In fact, she writes happily, she first slept with her older brother\u2019s best friend when she was 14. Yet the fixation on her \u201cpurity\u201d took \u201cthe focus off me as a musician and a performer\u201d, she writes. \u201cAll some reporters could think of to ask me was whether or not my breasts were real (they were, actually) and whether or not my hymen was intact.\u201d\nBritney Spears and Justin Timberlake in 2002. Photograph: Tom Mihalek\/AFP\/Getty Images\nWhen Timberlake tells the world that she cheated on him, she is all but emblazoned with a scarlet letter. While she knows she is powerless against that narrative (\u201cI don\u2019t think Justin realised the power he had in shaming me. I don\u2019t think he understands to this day\u201d), him telling the world that they had a sexual relationship was liberating. \u201cTo be honest with you, I liked that Justin said that,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhy did my managers work so hard to claim I was some kind of young-girl virgin even into my 20s? Whose business was it if I\u2019d had sex or not?\u201d\nBut she still couldn\u2019t escape the cycle that Timberlake set in motion: she describes her 2004 Onyx Hotel tour in the aftermath as \u201ctoo sexual, for a start. Justin had embarrassed me publicly, so my rebuttal onstage was to kind of go there a little bit, too. But it was absolutely horrible.\u201d\nShe has an immaculate sense of shade\nBritney seems too pure of heart for active malice, but she has an immaculate way with a piercing characterisation. Timberlake\u2019s band, \u2018NSync, were big hip-hop heads, she writes, and sometimes \u201ctried too hard to fit in\u201d with Black artists. When Timberlake spots Ginuwine at an event, he \u201cgot all excited and said, so loud, \u2018Oh yeah fo shiz, fo shiz! Ginuwiiiine! What\u2019s up, homie!\u2019\u201d\nHer account of being encouraged to abort their pregnancy at home, lest anyone see them going in and out of hospital, is horrifying. Britney, with no pain relief, is writhing on the floor. Timberlake proves to be the last person you\u2019d call in a crisis. \u201cAt some point he thought maybe music would help, so he got his guitar and he lay there with me, strumming it,\u201d she writes. Almost as embarrassing is husband Kevin Federline\u2019s attempt to start a music career. \u201cHe really thought he was a rapper now,\u201d she writes, with the bafflement of someone who has never known pretension. \u201cBless his heart \u2013 because he did take it so seriously.\u201d\nMotherhood leaves her vulnerable\nWhen Britney gets pregnant with her first son, she initially thinks it might protect her: \u201cI wanted everyone to stay away: stand back! There\u2019s a baby here!\u201d Inevitably, it doesn\u2019t work out that way. The paparazzi become aggressive, particularly once she has her kids in quick succession \u2013 becoming pregnant a second time three months after giving birth to her first. She suffers from postnatal depression and feels hopeless about her ability to protect her sons: \u201cI got a little depressed once I was no longer keeping them safe inside my body \u2026 I wanted them back inside me so the world couldn\u2019t get at them.\u201d\nEvery part of normal life had been stripped from me. I had no freedom and yet also no security\nShe has a keen sense of injustice regarding a perceived contract that she never signed with the public and the press. \u201cThey just kept acting like I owed it to them to let the men who kept trying to catch me looking fat take photos of my infant sons.\u201d Her postpartum body and shots of her without makeup were treated as \u201csome kind of a sin \u2013 as if gaining weight was something unkind I\u2019d done to them personally, a betrayal. At what point did I promise to stay 17 for the rest of my life?\u201d\nWhat she knows now, she writes, \u201cis that every part of normal life had been stripped from me \u2013 going out in public without becoming a headline, making normal mistakes as a new mother of two babies, feeling like I could trust the people around me. I had no freedom and yet also no security. At the time I was also suffering, I now know, from severe postpartum depression.\u201d It left her suicidal. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it, I felt that I couldn\u2019t live if things didn\u2019t get better.\u201d\nShe knows she is trapped in a state of arrested development\nIt\u2019s often said that famous people are frozen in time at the age they became famous, but Britney was never allowed to be a real child, nor a real adult. Her 2001 single I\u2019m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman may be her most prescient recording; she is painfully conscious of this divide. After her split from Timberlake, she likens herself to Benjamin Button. \u201cSomehow that year, in becoming more vulnerable I started to feel like a child again.\u201d\nThe situation worsens amid postnatal depression. \u201cIt was as if some part of me became the baby,\u201d she writes in an apologetic section about transferring her frustrations on to her interior decorator. \u201cOne part of me was a very demanding grown woman yelling about white marble, while another part of me was suddenly very childlike.\u201d\nWhen she is placed under the conservatorship, she not only regresses, but feels dehumanised by the constant scrutiny. \u201cI became a robot. But not just a robot \u2013 a sort of child-robot. The conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child.\u201d It\u2019s hard to explain, she says, \u201chow quickly I could vacillate between being a little girl and being a teenager and being a woman, because of the way they had robbed me of my freedom \u2026 They wanted me to be wild onstage, the way they told me to be, and to be a robot the rest of the time.\u201d\nMusic seems to have become an afterthought\nEarly on, Britney writes, she loved making music. She told the producer Max Martin that she wanted to sound more R&B than straight pop; she listened to Tainted Love the night before recording Baby, One More Time and stayed up late so that she would sound as gravelly and \u201cfried\u201d as Marc Almond. She was a studio perfectionist who would stay in the booth for hours, and the school setting and uniforms of the Baby video were her idea. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the moment in my life when I had the most passion for music,\u201d she writes. \u201cI was unknown and I had nothing to lose if I messed up.\u201d\nAfter that, her music barely gets a mention in A Woman Like Me. There\u2019s a nod to her breaking records; the era-defining Toxic is dispensed with in a sentence. The only album that she goes into any kind of detail on is 2007\u2019s cult favourite Blackout, made at the height of her public struggles yet full of potential. The studio was a refuge from the paparazzi hounding her outside; making a messy DIY video for the single Gimme More may be \u201cby far the worst video I\u2019ve ever shot in my life\u201d, but the scrappiness meant \u201cmore interesting people started noticing and wanting to work with me\u201d. There\u2019s some later love for 2016\u2019s Glory, and she writes proudly about her 2022 collaboration with Elton John, but says she has no plans to make music at the moment.\nHer life under the conservatorship is a horror story\nIt feels fitting that The Woman in Me is being released a week before Halloween. No matter how much we already know about the 13 years that Britney lived under a conservatorship, her recounting of its imposition, life under it and her inability to escape it is nothing short of a horror story. It is appalling, like something out of a Victorian novel, not the very real experiences of a thirtysomething in the last decade.\nWhen she fears that Federline is going to take away access to her kids, she locks herself in a bathroom with one of her sons. \u201cBefore I knew what was happening, a Swat team in black suits burst through the bathroom door as if I\u2019d hurt someone,\u201d she writes, and she is subject to a forced hospital hold. Soon after, her mother invites her to her beach house because \u201cthe cops are after you\u201d. When she arrives, so does another Swat team. \u201cI\u2019m a five-foot four-inch pop singer who calls everyone sir and ma\u2019am,\u201d she writes. \u201cThey treated me like I was a criminal or predator.\u201d\nThe conservatorship clamps down on her life, ruled by her father, who she alleges was \u201can alcoholic, someone who\u2019d declared bankruptcy, who\u2019d failed in business, who\u2019d terrified me as a little girl\u201d. She is medicated and surveilled. Her dates are required to agree to background checks and blood tests, made to sign NDAs, and receive a full rundown of her sexual history before the first date. \u201cThe insanity of this system kept me from finding basic companionship, having a fun night out or making new friends \u2013 let alone falling in love,\u201d Britney writes. \u201cIt was just the worst thing that could possibly ever happen to my music, my career and my sanity.\u201d\nShe accedes in order to retain access to her boys, but questions how she can perform at such a high level when she is perceived as \u201cso sick that I couldn\u2019t make my own decisions\u201d. She makes futile attempts to escape the arrangement; meanwhile her father sends her to rehab and Alcoholics Anonymous because she has been taking over-the-counter energy supplements. The women at AA inspire her to start trying to take control over her life but she just hits more walls. Her father won\u2019t let her remove her IUD to start a family with her new boyfriend, later husband, Sam Ashgari (they have divorced since Britney completed the memoir). After she objects to a new dance move suggested for her Vegas residency, she is sent to a solitary rehabilitation facility for two months, the most upsetting part of the book.\nWas I a bank robber? A wild animal? Why was I treated as though I were about to burn the place down and murder them all?\nShe is locked up, put on lithium, subject to relentless testing and mandatory therapy, can\u2019t see her kids or dog, can\u2019t bathe or dress in private or shut the door to her room, has set bed and waking times. For blood tests, \u201cthe tech drawing my blood would be flanked by the nurse, a security guard and my assistant. Was I a cannibal? Was I a bank robber? Was I a wild animal? Why was I treated as though I were about to burn the place down and murder them all?\u201d She wonders if her family is trying to kill her. Made slow and sclerotic, \u201cI began to feel like I was being ritually tortured,\u201d she writes, feeling estranged from her own body. \u201cIf the idea of my being in that place was to heal, that was not the effect.\u201d\nShe\u2019s not scared of anything after that experience, she writes, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t make me feel strong; it makes me sad. I shouldn\u2019t be this strong.\u201d\n#FreeBritney protesters in 2021. Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent\/EPA\nA nurse shows Britney the blossoming fan movement that is spreading awareness of its suspicions that all is not right with her conservatorship. Come June 2021, she calls 911 to report her father for conservatorship abuse days before a probate court hearing on the arrangement. \u201cMy voice had been used for me and against me so many times that I was afraid nobody would recognise it now if I spoke freely,\u201d she writes. When she is granted her freedom in November 2021, she says she feels shock, relief, elation, sadness and joy.\nThere is no love lost for her family\nBritney writes about how she was always made to feel she was not enough as a kid; her father\u2019s alleged alcoholism, neglect and brutal standards; how her mother always made her feel less-than. She is unsparing about her younger sister, who she characterises as a brat who was spared the pain of Britney\u2019s impoverished childhood because of her success. \u201cMy mom and I had to witness the ugliness and the violence without believing that there was anywhere else to go.\u201d\nEven once Britney is the biggest pop star in the world, her parents still seem to have an undue say in the running of her career, including making her sit for humiliating TV interviews \u2013 why exactly that is remains unanswered. Her father seizes control legally with the imposition of the conservatorship, telling her, chillingly, \u201cI am Britney Spears now,\u201d and her family appear to live off her dime while she lives an extraordinarily restricted life.\nWhen she returns home from the forced stint in a brutal rehab facility, she finds that her parents have thrown away her childhood things, including a binder full of her poetry. \u201cI felt an overwhelming sadness. I thought of the pages I\u2019d written through tears. I never wanted to publish them or anything like that, but they were important to me. And my family had thrown them in the trash, just like they\u2019d thrown me away.\u201d She resolves to start over with a new notebook. \u201cIn that moment I made peace with my family,\u201d she writes. \u201cBy which I mean that I realised I never wanted to see them again, and I was at peace with that.\u201d\nBritney writes that she is working to feel \u201cmore compassion than anger\u201d towards them. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Laura Snapes, was published by The Guardian on 2023-10-24 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":52}
{"title":"The jury finally hears from Sam Bankman-Fried","context":"## The jury finally hears from Sam Bankman-Fried\n\nIt is honestly kind of incredible to watch a man torpedo his own credibility on direct testimony. We\u2019re not even at the cross yet, and the judge has already instructed him to answer the question he\u2019s being asked by his own lawyer.\nThe jury is watching all of this intently.\nThe main thing that\u2019s been clear so far from Bankman-Fried\u2019s testimony is that the man really loves the sound of his own voice. So far, the count of \u201cObjection, narrative!\u201d to Bankman-Fried\u2019s answers, followed by \u201cSustained\u201d is at three.\nAlso, sometimes when Bankman-Fried says \u201cwe,\u201d he only means himself.\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been found guilty on seven counts including charges of wire fraud. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\nYesterday, during an evidentiary hearing, Bankman-Fried was repeatedly scolded by Judge Lewis Kaplan for not answering prosecutor Danielle Sassoon\u2019s questions on cross-examination. Today, Bankman-Fried was scolded by Kaplan for not answering his counsel Mark Cohen\u2019s questions on direct examination. Bankman-Fried has also occasionally interrupted Cohen with \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cyup.\u201d\nWe spent a lot of the morning explaining vocabulary. I will spare you the full list, though I will say that explaining \u201cAmazon Web Services\u201d and \u201cdatabase\u201d was a bit too detail-oriented. Then Bankman-Fried tried to define \u201cmarket manipulation.\u201d After Bankman-Fried gave his definition, Kaplan told the jury that he was the final authority on that, thanks.\nIn fairness to Bankman-Fried, he has been clearer and much easier to understand than he was at the evidentiary hearing yesterday. There was a minimum of word salad today. I don\u2019t know if he was more relaxed, or he\u2019d just been more rehearsed, but I will certainly be watching to see if he suddenly becomes much less coherent when Sassoon gets him for the cross.\nHere is the story of FTX, from his point of view.\nBankman-Fried, who informed us he\u2019s \u201csomewhat introverted, naturally,\u201d gave us a rather prolonged tour of his pre-Alameda Research life, which I will skip. In 2017, during a crypto bull run, he started his cryptocurrency trading firm. He knew \u201cbasically nothing\u201d about cryptocurrency at the time, he explained, but he wanted to do arbitrage on it anyway.\nAlameda Research was named for Alameda County in California, which was where its first office was set up. As for its name, here\u2019s what Bankman-Fried said on the stand:\nEffectively, we wanted to be under the radar at that point in time. I didn\u2019t want to call it Sam\u2019s Crypto Trading Firm or anything like that. We \u2014 there are a lot of competitors and people who we didn\u2019t particularly want to know what we were building out because they would race to do it. \u201cResearch\u201d was a sort of generic word, which filled out the company name. And that was \u2014 it was far better than the internal name that we had at that point, which was Wireless Mouse.\nI would find this much more believable if I hadn\u2019t already watched a video of Bankman-Fried explaining on a podcast that the name made it easier to get a bank account. That happened during the first day of Gary Wang\u2019s testimony. Bankman-Fried was there, too. You know who else was there? The jury.\nAnyway, Bankman-Fried went on a hiring spree for Alameda. He rounded up his merry gang of alleged co-conspirators. First, Wang, to program the computers. Then, Nishad Singh, about a month after founding Alameda Research. Finally, Caroline Ellison.\nNot having a risk team, when you are any kind of financial anything, is certainly a choice\nThough Bankman-Fried was the CEO, and also the majority owner, he wanted to be clear: he did not supervise Wang\u2019s direct work. Anyway, after a bunch of wildly successful arbitrage \u2014 50 percent to 100 percent annualized returns, per his testimony \u2014 he decided to found a cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. He figured he\u2019d fail; that there was only a 20 percent chance of success. Bankman-Fried did not define what he expected the time period to be on this estimate, but arguably 20 percent was a much higher chance of success than FTX would enjoy once Alameda dipped into the customer deposits.\nBy the way, because he was such a good guy, Bankman-Fried made a point of \u201cperiodically\u201d handling support tickets himself. \u201cI worried if I didn\u2019t, I would lose touch with the actual concerns of the customers,\u201d he testified. What he did not do was create a risk team, which he is now characterizing as a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d\nRisk is an inherent part of a futures exchange, which is even more like a casino than regular cryptocurrency. Not having a risk team, when you are any kind of financial anything, is certainly a choice. It is especially a choice when you go around telling everyone your crypto exchange is very good and safe.\nFTX\u2019s big selling point was its \u201crisk engine,\u201d which was supposed to prevent big losses that would then be spread around all the rest of the customers. But Bankman-Fried testified that in 2020, the \u201crisk engine was effectively sagging under the weight\u201d of the exchange\u2019s rapid growth. So its time to liquidation went up \u2014 it took minutes to determine which accounts needed to be liquidated. As a result, at one point the risk engine got stuck in a catastrophic feedback loop that would have created losses in the \u201ctrillions of dollars,\u201d Bankman-Fried testified. As part of that feedback loop, Alameda teetered on the brink of liquidation, which \u201cwould have disastrous consequences\u201d for FTX.\n\u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what was happening.\u201d\nBecause of that experience, Bankman-Fried suggested an \u201calert\u201d or \u201cdelay\u201d that would keep Alameda from being liquidated by a bug. This is the supposed origin story of \u201callow_negative,\u201d which Bankman-Fried says was the eventual result of that conversation, and that he says he didn\u2019t know about until very recently.\nThere is a problem with this story. \u201cAllow_negative\u201d was coded and switched on in 2019. I saw the code in court, and so did Bankman-Fried, who was also there for the testimony. Perhaps you are wondering, was the jury also there? Reader, it was.\nBankman-Fried denied he knew about the effectively infinite line of credit Alameda Research received from FTX. This argument was peculiar; essentially my take-away was that the CEO of a financial company simply didn\u2019t pay attention to finances.\nFTX couldn\u2019t get bank accounts right away. Bankman-Fried anticipated it would take a year or two. Rather than wait, he decided to use Alameda as the \u201cpayment provider\u201d for bank transfers. \u201cMy understanding at the time was that there were teams managing the process,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what was happening.\u201d\nWell, sure, understandable! He\u2019s an introvert!\nBankman-Fried definitely did not know that Singh, his employee, had backdated interest payments to get FTX \u201cover the line\u201d to $1 billion\nIn 2021, FTX was growing to millions of users, with $1 billion of revenue. Bankman-Fried said he worked 12 to 22 hours a day, and took one day off every couple of months. Because FTX had grown so much, he could no longer run both companies, he said. Bankman-Fried handed the company off to Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco, who immediately after being named co-CEO promptly drifted away to early retirement. (Quiet quitting king!) Bankman-Fried did remain involved in hedging and risk at Alameda, though.\nAbout that $1 billion of revenue in 2021: Bankman-Fried definitely did not know that Singh, his employee, had backdated interest payments to get FTX \u201cover the line\u201d to $1 billion. See, he\u2019d just asked his employees to check and see if there was any source of funds that was missing to get to $1 billion. This testimony was especially rambling.\nOh, also that MobileCoin loss? The one Wang said Alameda took to keep off FTX\u2019s balance sheet? Yeah, so it was a totally innocent thing where what actually happened was that Bankman-Fried thought it was appropriate that Alameda take the position as a backstop liquidity provider, that\u2019s all.\nIn June 2022, Bankman-Fried heard about the account called \u201cfiat@ftx\u201d tracking how much money Alameda owed to FTX, he testified. He did not know what it was and did not bother to find out. He was busy! That was when Bankman-Fried directed Ellison to repay Alameda\u2019s lenders, because he thought Alameda was good for it. He also gave BlockFi and Voyager, two crypto lenders, some capital infusions for good measure.\nHe was \u201cvery surprised!\u201d\nRemember that testimony Adam Yedidia gave about a conversation with Bankman-Fried in August 2022 about the enormous amount of money Alameda owed FTX? Well, Bankman-Fried remembers it differently. See, Yedidia was just asking about Alameda\u2019s risk profile, and Bankman-Fried wasn\u2019t talking about insolvency at all.\nAlso, when Singh and Bankman-Fried had the dramatic balcony conversation at their penthouse, it was just that Singh thought Alameda\u2019s liabilities had gotten too high, and FTX was spending too much money on marketing. But Bankman-Fried still thought that Alameda had more assets than liabilities, so it was all fine, and besides, if Singh thought he was going to be better at marketing, he could take it over. It didn\u2019t have anything to do with the money Alameda owed FTX at all.\nOf course not! Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t learn about the $8 billion liability associated with Alameda until October 2022, he said. And he learned it all by himself, by looking at a computer database. When he found it, he was \u201cvery surprised!\u201d\nBesides the two obvious lies Bankman-Fried told on the stand \u2014 about Alameda Research\u2019s name and about \u201callow_negative\u201d \u2014 I have been struck by how little he seems to know about his own companies. Apparently, Singh, Wang, and Ellison were out there just doing whatever their little hearts desired. Because Bankman-Fried was a CEO, but definitely not the kind that pays any attention to money at his crypto trading firm and futures exchange.\n\nThis article, authored by Elizabeth Lopatto, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-28 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":53}

By then, Microsoft had already hired Altman and Brockman to head up a new internal AI unit, though, as things transpired, nothing had actually been signed yet, with rumors suggesting that the ousted leaders might actually return to OpenAI after all \u2014 in some capacity, at least.\nThe situation remains fluid, and any number of potential outcomes still remain on the table. But the whole debacle has shone a spotlight on the forces that control the burgeoning AI revolution, leading many to question what happens if you go all-in on a centralized proprietary player, and what happens if things then go belly-up?\n\u201cThe OpenAI \/ Microsoft drama underlines one of the big near-term risks with AI \u2014 that this next wave of technology is controlled by the same tiny set of players who have shaped that last era of the internet,\u201d Mark Surman, president and executive director at the Mozilla Foundation, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe might have a chance of avoiding this if GPT-X were responsibly open sourced, giving researchers and startups a shot at making this technology safer, more useful and more trustworthy for people everywhere.\u201d\nOpen and shut\nIn an open letter published by Mozilla a few weeks back, Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun joined some 70 other signatories in calling for more openness in AI development, though that letter has since garnered more than 1,700 signatures. The backdrop stems from Big Tech companies such as OpenAI and Google\u2019s DeepMind calling for more regulation, warning of catastrophic consequences if the AI levers were to meet the wrong hands \u2014 in other words, they argued that proprietary AI is safer than open source.\nLeCun et al. disagree.\n\u201cYes, openly available models come with risks and vulnerabilities \u2014 AI models can be abused by malicious actors or deployed by ill-equipped developers,\u201d the letter acknowledged. \u201cHowever, we have seen time and time again that the same holds true for proprietary technologies \u2014 and that increasing public access and scrutiny makes technology safer, not more dangerous. The idea that tight and proprietary control of foundational AI models is the only path to protecting us from society-scale harm is naive at best, dangerous at worst.\u201d\nOn a personal level, LeCun has accused the big-name AI players of trying to secure \u201cregulatory capture of the AI industry\u201d by lobbying against open AI R&D. And on a company level, Meta is doing all it can to encourage collaboration and \u201copenness,\u201d recently partnering with Hugging Face to launch a new startup accelerator designed to spur adoption of open source AI models.\nBut OpenAI was \u2014 up until last week, at least \u2014 still the AI darling everyone wanted to dance with. Countless startups and scale-ups have built businesses atop OpenAI\u2019s proprietary GPT-X large language models (LLMs), and over the weekend hundreds of OpenAI customers reportedly started contacting OpenAI\u2019s rivals, which include Anthropic, Google and Cohere, concerned that their own businesses might be impacted if OpenAI was to disintegrate overnight.\nOver-reliance\nThe panic has been palpable. But there are precedents from elsewhere in the technology sphere, perhaps most notably that of the cloud computing industry, which became renowned for the way it locked companies in to centralized, vortex-like silos.\n\u201cPart of the frenzy around the future of OpenAI is due to too many startups over-relying on their proprietary models,\u201d Luis Ceze, University of Washington computer science professor and OctoML CEO, told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to put all your chips in one basket \u2014 we saw that in the early cloud days which led to companies shifting to multi-cloud and hybrid environments.\u201d\nOn the surface, Microsoft is currently looking like the biggest winner amidst the OpenAI turmoil, as it was already apparently looking to reduce its reliance on OpenAI even though it remains once of its major shareholders. But Facebook\u2019s parent Meta could also stand to benefit, as businesses pursue multi-modal strategies or models with a more \u201copen\u201d ethos embedded.\n\u201cOpen source today offers a wide variety of models for companies to essentially diversify,\u201d Ceze added. \u201cBy doing so, these startups can quickly pivot and minimize risk. There is also a major upside \u2014 many of these models already outperform the likes of OpenAI\u2019s in terms [of] price-performance and speed.\u201d\nA leaked internal memo from Google earlier this year seemed to express fears that despite the huge advances made by proprietary LLM models from the likes of OpenAI, open source AI would ultimately trump them all. \u201cWe have no moat, and neither does OpenAI,\u201d the document noted.\nThe memo in question was in reference to a foundation language model initially leaked from Meta in March, and which gained a fair bit of steam in a short period of time. This highlighted the power and scalability of a more open approach to AI development \u2014 it enables collaboration and experimentation on a level that\u2019s not so easy to replicate with closed models.\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that despite Meta\u2019s claims, its Llama-branded family of LLMs are not as \u201copen source\u201d as it would like people to believe. Yes, they are available for both research and commercial use cases, but it forbids developers to use Llama for training other models, while app developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta which it may grant based on its \u201csole discretion\u201d \u2014 basically, anyone but Meta\u2019s Big Tech brethren can use Llama sans permission.\nFor sure, Meta isn\u2019t the only company flaunting its \u201copen\u201d approach to AI development \u2014 notably, the likes of Hugging Face, Mistral AI and 01.AI, which have all raised sizeable sums at lofty valuations with similar goals in mind. But as a $900 billion juggernaut with a long history of courting developers through open source endeavors, Meta is perhaps best positioned to capitalize on the mess that OpenAI has created for itself. Its decision to pursue \u201copenness\u201d over \u201cclosedness\u201d seems to be well vindicated right now, and regardless of whether Llama is or isn\u2019t really open source, it\u2019s likely \u201copen enough\u201d for most people.\nIt\u2019s still too early to make any surefire claims on what impact the OpenAI fallout will have on LLM development and uptake in the future. Altman and Brockman are undoubtedly steady hands for a commercial AI startup, and they may even return to steward OpenAI. But some might argue that it\u2019s unhealthy that so much focus lies on just a handful of people \u2014 and it\u2019s telling that their departure has created such widespread havoc.\n\nThis article, authored by Paul Sawers, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-21 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":54}

Stop scrolling, start watching!\nTubi, Fox\u2019s ad-supported free streaming service, has one of the most vast libraries of any streaming service out there, with thousands upon thousands of movies available for you to watch at home.\nThat makes it quite difficult to curate the best of the best. I\u2019m not exaggerating \u2014 when building this list, I looked up my \u201cliked\u201d films on Letterboxd that are currently on Tubi, and more than 100 showed up. So we\u2019ve done our best to narrow that down to a group of excellent movies from a variety of moods, cultures, and eras.\nWe\u2019ll continue to update this list with more Tubi picks over time, building out a full catalog of excellent free movies for you to watch at home. Our latest update added Planet Terror as an editor\u2019s pick.\nLet\u2019s get into it.\nEditor\u2019s Pick\nPlanet Terror\nDirector: Robert Rodriguez\nCast: Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Michael Biehn\nFew images feel more emblematic of the bombastic action and humor of Robert Rodriguez\u2019s oeuvre than the shot of Rose McGowan aiming the grenade launcher of a leg-mounted assault rifle from the back of a motorcycle in Planet Terror. Released alongside Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Death Proof as the theatrical double feature Grindhouse, the film follows the story of a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling (McGowan) and her estranged lover \u201cEl Wray\u201d (Freddy Rodriguez), who find themselves among a handful of survivors after a deadly biochemical agent sparks a zombie outbreak. Banding together, the survivors must find a way to escape the town while fighting against the rogue military commander (Bruce Willis) who unleashed the virus in the first place.\nIntentionally tongue-in-cheek, Planet Terror\u2019s story and dialogue are the furthest thing from the film\u2019s saving graces. Inspired by the exploitation films of the \u201970s, the movie gleefully relishes in its over-the-top throwback aesthetic, with gory action, comically implausible plotlines, and unabashed sexuality. If you\u2019re looking for a peak \u201cturn your brain off and enjoy\u201d sort of movie, Planet Terror is your ticket to ride. \u2014Toussaint Egan\nCertified Copy\nDirector: Abbas Kiarostami\nCast: Juliette Binoche, William Shimell\nThe late Abbas Kiarostami was one of the most masterful directors of his time, and his masterful romance Certified Copy is available to watch for free at home. Congratulations.\nCertified Copy follows two people: a French antique dealer (Juliette Binoche, arresting as always), and a British writer (famed opera baritone William Shimell), who meet in Tuscany while the latter is promoting his new book. The book, titled Certified Copy, puts forth the argument that there is no such thing as a \u201ccopy\u201d in art, because even reproductions are original works. The two debate this idea, as the idea of what is \u201creal\u201d gets called into question, even the very nature of their relationship.\nA gorgeous film led by two unforgettable performances, Certified Copy is the kind of masterpiece that will linger with you for years to come. You will fall in love, with this film specifically and with film generally: It depicts humanity at our most impenetrably complex in a way that lays bare our fears and hopes, all while being warm, charming, and delightfully funny. It\u2019s one of a kind, but also in conversation with many other films about love and art. After all, every copy is its own original work. \u2014Pete Volk\nHoop Dreams\nDirector: Steve James\nCast: William Gates, Arthur Agee\nThe NBA playoffs have just started with a bang, so what better time than now to watch the greatest basketball movie (and one of the greatest American documentaries) ever made?\nHoop Dreams embeds itself with two high school basketball stars who want nothing more than to make it in the NBA. It\u2019s not just a basketball movie, though; director Steve James paints an in-depth portrait of not only his subject\u2019s lives, but of the fallibility of the American dream and who gets left behind. One of the defining movies of our nation, Hoop Dreams is a compelling and moving must-watch for all, not just basketball fans. \u2014PV\nJoint Security Area\nDirector: Park Chan-wook\nCast: Lee Yeong-ae, Lee Byung-hun, Song Kang-ho\nPark Chan-wook\u2019s most recent movie, Decision to Leave, was my No. 1 film of 2022, and he\u2019s one of my very favorite filmmakers working today. He\u2019s made many excellent movies over the course of his career, and you can argue it all traces back to Joint Security Area, the breakout hit that helped launch his career.\nA tightly wound thriller, JSA stars with the killing of two North Korean soldiers in the DMZ, and a Swiss Army major who has been sent to investigate the killings. As we learn more, JSA starts to become a movie about an unlikely friendship, and the ways that constructs like borders divide us and put is in deadly opposition to each other.\nThe highest-grossing movie in Korean history at the time, JSA helped launch Park\u2019s career as well as those of stars Lee Young-ae, Lee Byung-hun, and Song Kang-ho. They\u2019re all excellent in the movie, bringing a complicated and intense story to life. \u2014PV\nMandy\nDirector: Panos Cosmatos\nCast: Nicolas Cage, Andrea Riseborough, Linus Roache\nYearning for more Nicolas Cage-fueled insanity after watching Renfield and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent? What am I saying \u2014 of course you are!\nPanos Cosmatos\u2019 2018 action horror film Mandy not only features what many considered one of the actor\u2019s best performances of the past decade, it\u2019s also \u2014 as revealed in a recent episode of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert \u2014 one of Cage\u2019s favorite movies he\u2019s ever worked on.\nAfter watching Mandy, it\u2019s not hard to see why. Praised for its psychedelic brutality, over-the-top performances, and a prog-rock-inspired score courtesy of the late great composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, Mandy follows the story of a lumberjack who embarks on a conquest of revenge to kill the monstrous Gwar-like cult members who murdered his beloved girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough). You wanna see Nicolas Cage drink vodka in his underwear while wailing hysterically in a pink-tiled bathroom? Here ya go. You wanna see Nicolas Cage go head-to-head against a hulking monster named \u201cFuck Pig,\u201d snort cocaine off a glass table, and get into chainsaw fight? You got it, sport! Mandy is a blast and if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, boy are you missing out. \u2014TE\nShadow\nDirector: Zhang Yimou\nCast: Deng Chao, Sun Li, Zheng Kai\nNo one in the world makes more beautiful action movies than Zhang Yimou. His latest, the political comedy Full River Red, is a fun and strange twist-y thriller that trades some of his usual love for soaring action for fast-paced dialogue and a highly complicated narrative. But Zhang is perhaps best known for his work in the wuxia genre, like Hero, House of Flying Daggers, and Shadow \u2014 all breathless displays of cinematic excellence.\nMuch like Full River Red, Shadow is rich on political intrigue. But it doesn\u2019t skimp on the action \u2014 that umbrella you see above is made of blades, and there are many outstanding action sequences utilizing the unconventional weapon. While in color, Shadow makes great use of black-and-white imagery in every element, from stark costuming and set design to lighting that brings out the contrast of black and white. It\u2019s also a master class of framing bodies in motion and one of the best action movies of the century. We are all lucky to be able to watch it for free. \u2014Pete Volk\nSteamboy\nDirector: Katsuhiro Otomo\nCast: Anne Suzuki, Manami Konishi, Katsuo Nakamura\nKatsuhiro Otomo\u2019s 2004 steampunk action anime doesn\u2019t get nearly as much love as it deserves. Steamboy follows the adventures of James Ray Steam, the wizkid grandson of a genius scientist living an alternate 1860s Britain, who finds himself in the crosshairs of a nefarious robber baron who wants to conqueror the world using the \u201cSteamball,\u201d an invention capable of generating an infinite (and dangerous) amount of energy.\nIt may not have neon-lit metropolises populated by roving teenage biker gangs and children with terrifying psychic powers like 1988\u2019s Akira, but it certainly doesn\u2019t lack for its own gorgeous Victorian-era visuals, thrilling action sequences, and beautifully realized mechanical animation. If nothing else, Otomo\u2019s film is a marvel of early 21st-century animation, a film situated at the faultlines of traditional hand-drawn cel animation and the anime industry\u2019s gradual embrace of digitally rendered and painted set-pieces and 3D-animated assets.\nIt\u2019s a gorgeous love letter to pulp action serials, steampunk alternate history stories, and the writings of Jules Verne cast in a similar mold as another 2004 cult classic: Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. While the film wasn\u2019t quite the second coming of Akira anime fans so eagerly wanted it to be, Steamboy is a more than worthy follow-up to Otomo\u2019s feature debut in its own right and more than enough to tide you over while you wait for an update on Orbital Era, the director\u2019s first anime feature in 20 years, which was announced in 2019. \u2014Toussaint Egan\nWhat Lies Below\nDirector: Braden Duemmler\nCast: Ema Horvath, Haskiri Velazquez, Trey Tucker\nBraden R. Duemmler\u2019s What Lies Below stars Ema Horvath as Libby, a 16-year-old girl who returns home to her mother\u2019s lake house after summer camp to discover that she\u2019s taken on a new boyfriend, John (Trey Tucker). While initially accepting of her mom\u2019s new beau, Libby gradually begins to suspect that something is... off about John that he\u2019s trying to conceal. With no one but her friend Marley (Haskiri Velazquez) to turn to for help, Libby must expose the truth of John\u2019s sinister nature before it\u2019s too late to save her mother... and herself. Filled with mounting tension, creepy ethereal visuals, and a mind-bogglingly bizarre ending, What Lies Below has more appeal to it than what might at first appear on its surface. \u2014TE\n\nThis article, authored by Pete Volk, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-25 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":55}
{"title":"FanDuel Picks Week 15: Best NFL DFS lineup advice for daily fantasy football tournaments","context":"## FanDuel Picks Week 15: Best NFL DFS lineup advice for daily fantasy football tournaments\n\nThe best part of fantasy football is watching the team you draft go out there and have a chance to win a championship, forever cementing your bragging rights over your friends for years to come. The worst part of fantasy is watching the team you drafted go out there and get injured, forget how to play the sport, and then plummet to the bottom of the standings. So if you were one of the lucky ones to reach postseason football in the fantasy world -- congratulations. If you weren't, good news -- just because the regular season has come to a close doesn't mean we can't still keep searching for ways to win. That's why we're heading over to FanDuel to craft the perfect Week 15 DFS lineup to give us something to root for all day long while our friends stress about their team faltering despite dominating for 14 weeks.\nBefore we break down our picks and strategy, here are the most notable scoring rules for FanDuel contests: four-point passing TDs and half-point PPR.\nWEEK 15 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nFanDuel Picks Week 15: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments\nSunday main slate, $60,000 budget\nQB Matthew Stafford, Rams vs. Commanders ($7,200). Stafford returns to the friendly confines of SoFi Stadium after having to deal with the elements in Baltimore last week. After nearly pulling off the upset over the Ravens, the QB has a nice landing spot against a defense that is equivalent to the props used in training camp. Washington can't slow anyone down, and it has only gotten worse since they traded away two of their best defenders at the deadline. Stafford doesn't have the rushing upside, but he's more than capable of having a good day with his arm.\nRB Rachaad White, Buccaneers @ Packers ($7,600). White stockholders are feeling pretty good right now after singing his praises all offseason. The RB has rewarded them with eight straight games of at least double-digit fantasy performances, including three straight games with at least 100 total yards. Tampa has handed the ball off to White 60 times over that stretch, something that has ticked up with each passing week. As arguably the top option in the Bucs' offense, we'd be crazy to stand in the way of White against a vulnerable Packers defense in Week 15.\nWEEK 15 DFS:\nDK lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nRB Breece Hall, Jets @ Dolphins ($7,500). Did the Jets offense find something against the Texans? We're not quite buying in yet, but it does appear that New York's coaches figured they should stop coaching scared. With the season essentially over for Gang Green barring a miracle, the staff took the handcuffs off Zach Wilson and unleashed an offense that's been run-run-pass-punting their way to irrelevance all season long. In doing so last week, Hall was a weapon as a receiver, posting over 100 total yards for the first time since Week 5. If the Jets continue their willingness to take chances downfield and let Wilson stop being a game manager, then Hall is in line for another big day.\nWR Deebo Samuel, 49ers @ Cardinals ($8,400). We'll just keep riding with Samuel down the stretch, as he isn't giving us any reason to reconsider. He has back-to-back games with 30 fantasy points and has been a man on a mission since Thanksgiving. He shouldn't have any problems continuing that run against the Cardinals on Sunday.\nWEEK 15 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWR Puka Nacua, Rams vs. Commanders ($8,000). Usually, one of Nacua or Kupp has a big day, but this week it could both. Either way, we're on the Nacua train heading into Sunday since the rookie has been by far the L.A.'s most consistent weapon all season. Even with Kupp back in the fold, Stafford continues to trust Nacua. He's not seeing the 15-20 targets a game like earlier in the year, but the rookie is making the most of his seven-plus opportunities a game. Against a terrible defense, both receivers should see plenty of chances to make their mark on the game. Nacua checks in at $200 less and is arguably better than Kupp in fantasy at this stage. In a game where every dollar counts, pocketing that extra $200 can really pay off at another roster spot.\nWR Rashee Rice, Chiefs @ Patriots ($6,500). There are plenty of issues with the Chiefs' receivers, but Rice is not one of them. The rookie has been very impressive through the first 14 weeks of his NFL career and hauled in yet another touchdown on Sunday to post a respectable fantasy showing. He's been targeted 29 times over the past three games and scored twice. We can expect New England will try to take away Travis Kelce, meaning that the opportunities could be coming even more often for Rice in Week 15.\nWEEK 15 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nTE Chig Okonkwo, Titans vs. Texans ($5,000). Okonkwo has emerged as a nice weapon for the rookie QB Will Levis, with his target share ticking up as the season has progressed. He turned in 45 and 62 yards, respectively, in Weeks 12 and 13, seeing 11 targets in that span. All that's missing is a touchdown. In a brutal week for main-slate TE matchups, we like Okonkwo to outperform his listed salary against a Texans team that's had its fair share of struggles defending the position recently.\nFLEX WR Jayden Reed, Packers vs. Buccaneers ($6,100). The status of Christian Watson (hamstring) will hang over the Packers heading into their game against the Buccaneers. Reed is more than capable of having a big day whether Watson plays or not. The former North Dakota State receiver's presence has capped Reed's ceiling recently, but Tampa's secondary is still having major issues doing its job. Jordan Love appears to have turned a corner, meaning we should expect him to put on a show back at home. Reed will be the primary beneficiary on Sunday.\nDEF New York Giants @ Saints ($3,500). There is a lot of bad offense across the NFL this season, and despite signing Derek Carr to make sure they wouldn't be listed among them, the Saints are there anyway. The QB refuses to sit out and deal with the laundry list of injuries ailing him at this point despite them clearly being an issue. Teammates appear fed up with Carr and would seemingly prefer the team return him to the dealership. The Saints are upside-down on this deal right now, with no end in sight. The Giants aren't good, but they have enough defensive pop to contain an offense that keeps spinning its tires most weeks.\nBest SuperDraft NFL DFS Picks for Week 15\nThis year, we're also listing our favorite DFS plays on SuperDraft.\nFor those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.\nMORE: Win BIG with SuperDraft!

{"title":"Fantasy Football Week 13 Lineup Decisions: Starts, Sits, Sleepers, Busts to know for every game","context":"## Fantasy Football Week 13 Lineup Decisions: Starts, Sits, Sleepers, Busts to know for every game\n\nFantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.\nIt's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.\nWe'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Christian McCaffrey). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.\nIt's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected Strength of Schedule rankings broken down by position available on SportsLine. My objective is to break down how the schedule affects every Fantasy relevant player for the upcoming four weeks, the playoff stretch and the entire season.

Easy peasy!\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nBoth teams had a week of rest, so don't treat this like a typical Thursday game. But do expect the Cowboys defense to keep the pressure on Geno Smith and a Seattle offense that's struggled to gain consistency over the last month. Smith actually did OK completing passes last week when pressured (60% completion rate) but not at an efficient level (5.4 yards per attempt). Just two QBs have exceeded 250 yards and four QBs have thrown multiple touchdowns against Dallas this year; I don't like Smith's chances to do either, which hurts any upside case for any Seahawks receiver. By the way, Curtis Samuel was the first receiver to get 100 yards on the Cowboys this year, and it took him 12 targets and 9 catches to get there. No one else has had more than 86.\nSTARTS: Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, Tony Pollard, DK Metcalf (low-end WR2), Jake Ferguson, Cowboys DST\nDak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, Tony Pollard, DK Metcalf (low-end WR2), Jake Ferguson, Cowboys DST SITS: Tyler Lockett (flex at best), Geno Smith, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Zach Charbonnet, Michael Gallup, Seahawks DST\nTyler Lockett (flex at best), Geno Smith, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Zach Charbonnet, Michael Gallup, Seahawks DST SLEEPERS: Brandin Cooks\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline DK Metcalf WR SEA Seattle \u2022 #14\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs.

That kind of usage, especially in a game where the Seahawks figure to pass a bunch, makes him a borderline must-start. But on the 12 targets he's seen that have traveled at least 15 Air Yards over the past four weeks, Metcalf has caught just three. More alarming: Five of the targets were knocked away by defenders who were right on him when the ball arrived. He's not really zooming past anyone these days, and he's not winning contested catches regularly either. Pair that with the expectation that he'll line up across from DaRon Bland for much of the game (Bland usually plays right cornerback; Metcalf primarily lines up at left wide receiver) and it could be a rough one. Bland has allowed one touchdown and has allowed just a 52.5% catch rate with 13 passes defensed and seven interceptions.

He also doesn't see nearly as many deep throws as Metcalf -- literally two targets in his past two games traveled 15 or more Air Yards. Obviously he has potential to always pop off for a big game like he did against a tough Browns defense five weeks ago, but recent matchups against the Niners, Rams and Ravens weren't kind to Lockett. They were even less kind to Geno Smith, and this week shouldn't be much different. Tack on the tough assignment in Stephon Gilmore in coverage (unless the Cowboys use shadow coverage for the first time this year), and Lockett could be in for another lean night. I don't mind him as a WR3 over Drake London, DeAndre Hopkins and Diontae Johnson, but I'd start Rashee Rice and Adam Thielen over Lockett.\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jake Ferguson TE DAL Dallas \u2022 #87\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs.

The Cowboys are expected to lead this matchup pretty handily, which can squash the upside for a lot of yardage from Ferguson. As for his chances of scoring, 37% of his targets (7 of 19) over the past five weeks have come in the red zone. That's good. But the Seahawks have allowed one touchdown to a tight end all season (David Njoku, Week 8)! Mark Andrews had a great game against Seattle, but even he didn't score. I suspect the Seahawks will have a plan to try and cover Ferguson near the end zone without having to sacrifice too much elsewhere. He's a low-upside play I'd sit for Juwan Johnson, Gerald Everett and Logan Thomas.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSeven straight quarterbacks to face the Broncos have failed to get to 20 Fantasy points, including Josh Allen once and Patrick Mahomes twice! Denver's forced at least one turnover from a quarterback in eight straight games and kept quarterbacks to under 7.0 yards per attempt in five straight. Denver also seems to be playing a lot of heavy zone coverage to deter quarterbacks from throwing deep, mostly Cover-3, and they're also starting to blitz more over the last month than they did before. Stroud's Houdini act has helped him beat most of the defenses he's faced, and this one isn't worthy of being feared, but there is some worry Stroud have a monster game without some massive yards after the catch (YAC) from his receivers. Fortunately he ranks ninth-best on the season among qualifying QBs in YAC per completion (5.37).\nSTARTS: C.J.

He's top five among qualifying quarterbacks in completion rate at 68.3%, he's first in TD rate at 6.3%, he's fourth in off-target rate (7.8%) and he's clearly worked out his issues with his offensive line because he's landed the fourth-longest time-to-throw average (3.14 seconds). And yet he's done this without firing downfield a ton (32nd in passing ADOT at 6.7 yards)! It hasn't translated for Fantasy because Wilson is averaging 29 attempts per game, and it's even lower in his past six games (26). Expect Wilson to throw more in what could become a shootout against the Texans. QBs against Houston are averaging 34.8 pass attempts per game, and the Texans pass rush shouldn't be a problem. I'd count on Wilson to have a 20-plus point game and thus start him over Kyler Murray, Baker Mayfield, Sam Howell and Jordan Love.\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Devin Singletary RB HOU Houston \u2022 #26\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs.

Some of that was made up for with receptions, giving him weak yardage totals without a touchdown. Rest assured, Singletary is still clearly Houston's lead back -- he played 81% of their snaps and dominated third downs and snaps inside the 5, even though it appeared Pierce rotated drives with him starting with the third one. The matchup is pretty good as Denver's run defense is the only element that hasn't improved much this season. While it's true that the Broncos have given up just one rushing touchdown in their past six games, it's also true they've let up 5.4 yards per carry in those same six games. Bank on the Texans giving Singletary more work on the ground to pace their offense. I'd start him over Jerome Ford, Javonte Williams and Joe Mixon.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nThe Patriots have seemingly backed off of being blitz-heavy over their past three games, perhaps because they realized they can get similar payoffs without it (only three of their past nine sacks have come on blitzes). They also have an inflated sack total because they recorded six against the Giants -- they have no more than three in any other game this year including zero against the Colts in Week 10. They haven't stopped playing a lot of man coverage lately, which shouldn't bother Justin Herbert because he's efficient against all coverages (and a little bit better against man-to-man). L.A. hasn't put up more than 20 points in two straight, but 20 points should be more than enough to beat a Patriots offense that's scored 17 or fewer points in 9 of its past 10 games.\nSTARTS: Justin Herbert, Keenan Allen, Austin Ekeler, Rhamondre Stevenson\nJustin Herbert, Keenan Allen, Austin Ekeler, Rhamondre Stevenson SITS: Hunter Henry, Quentin Johnston, all Patriots WRs; Demario Douglas is OUT\nHunter Henry, Quentin Johnston, all Patriots WRs; Demario Douglas is OUT SLEEPERS: Gerald Everett, Jalen Guyton\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nThe Lions need an answer for their ugly pass defense -- since their Week 9 bye they've been mostly great against the run (3.1 yards per carry allowed, one RB to get 15-plus PPR points) but they rank bottom-six in completion rate allowed (68.4%), yards per attempt allowed (8.0), passing ADOT against (8.84 yards) and defensive Expected Points Added (EPA) per dropback (-0.40, which is league-worst). And of their second-most eight passing touchdowns given up in three games, five have come on passes of 15-plus Air Yards, which is tied for most in the league. They should catch a break with field stretcher Rashid Shaheed (thigh) missing the matchup for New Orleans; Chris Olave looks like he will play. After the injuries to Shaheed and Olave last Sunday it was Alvin Kamara who predictably led the way in targets per routes run (30.8%). Kamara gets a boost both in the pass game and run game with Lions linebacker Alex Anzalone missing action with a hand injury. For the Lions offense, expect the run game to get a bit more focus with Saints linebacker Pete Werner sidelined and All-Pro defensive end Cameron Jordan questionable to play.\nSTARTS: Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs, Alvin Kamara, Chris Olave (if he passes concussion protocol), David Montgomery, Sam LaPorta, Taysom Hill\nJared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs, Alvin Kamara, Chris Olave (if he passes concussion protocol), David Montgomery, Sam LaPorta, Taysom Hill SITS: Derek Carr, both DSTs\nDerek Carr, both DSTs SLEEPERS: Juwan Johnson\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nThe Falcons defense finally had a strong showing against the Saints last week, but they got a little lucky because so many players from New Orleans left with injuries. In the three games prior their defense had a knack for making mediocre offenses look amazing (Will Levis' breakout game, Josh Dobbs' first game with the Vikings, Kyler Murray's first game with the Cardinals). I'm pretty certain they're not bad enough to make Tim Boyle look like Tim Tebow or even Tim Hasselbeck, but I do wonder if they're juuust bad enough to give better-than-normal numbers to Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall. Reinforcements along the O-line should help the Jets' cause against a Falcons defense that's blitzed at a league-average rate, is eighth-lowest in pass rush pressure rate and is fifth-lowest in sacks (28).\nSTARTS: Bijan Robinson, Garrett Wilson, Breece Hall, Drake London, Jets DST, Falcons DST\nBijan Robinson, Garrett Wilson, Breece Hall, Drake London, Jets DST, Falcons DST SITS: Kyle Pitts, Tyler Conklin, Tyler Allgeier, both QBs\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nPittsburgh's biggest change in offensive scheme last week involved Kenny Pickett throwing over the middle much more than before (Pat Freiermuth benefitted). But they also ran the ball effectively at Cincinnati -- Najee Harris had one of his best games this year. Expect more of the same against the Cardinals this week. Arizona has allowed five touchdowns to tight ends over its past five games but actually has been relatively efficient defending them otherwise. Can't say the same against the run as the Redbirds rank in the bottom five in pretty much every single run defense metric except yards after contact per rush (where they're league average). A running back has scored 17 or more PPR points in four of their past five against the Cardinals, and eight in 12 games have hit at least 15 PPR points.

In three games, Arizona has become pass-heavy (63.7% pass rate) -- a stark contrast from Conner's five games before injury (55.6% pass rate). And while Conner has had some red-zone carries in those games with Murray, his O-line hasn't kept him clean, especially near the goal line. Meanwhile Murray has a rushing touchdown in three straight games. Conner will face his former team, one that has held all but four running backs to less than 15 PPR points this year, and the ones who notched 15-plus scored a touchdown. If that doesn't make you feel good about Conner, then you'll especially dislike that he's averaged 0.42 yards before contact on his runs since Murray's return, good for 44th out of 47 running backs (Breece Hall and Derrick Henry had it worse). Pittsburgh's unit held the Bengals and Browns in consecutive weeks to 0.5 yards before contact or less. If you start Conner, don't expect an efficient day and pray to Ye Olde Fantasy Gods for a garbage-time touchdown. I'd rather trust Jaylen Warren, Chuba Hubbard and A.J. Dillon.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nExpect plenty of rushing. Losing Jonathan Taylor stings for the Colts but Zack Moss was unreal in his efficiency between Weeks 2 through 5 when Taylor was either out or barely played (5.0 yards per carry is a generic example), and he's only been a little bit worse (4.4 yards per carry) since Taylor took a larger chunk of the workload starting in Week 6. Meanwhile, Derrick Henry was back in a familiar spot of handling plenty of carries against an inferior opponent, scoring twice and tallying 76 rush yards. Anytime he's in a close game or a Titans win, he tends to do well. The Colts rank in the bottom-five in Fantasy points allowed per game this season while the Titans are closer to league-average, but both are in the top-six in RB rush attempts per game against (at least 24.0 each) in their past four games.\nSTARTS: Michael Pittman, Derrick Henry, Zack Moss\nMichael Pittman, Derrick Henry, Zack Moss SITS: DeAndre Hopkins (PPR flex at best), Josh Downs (PPR flex at best), Will Levis, Titans DST\nDeAndre Hopkins (PPR flex at best), Josh Downs (PPR flex at best), Will Levis, Titans DST SLEEPERS: Colts DST, Gardner Minshew\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nWith edge rusher Jaelan Phillips, the Dolphins ranked third in sacks (38) and sixth in pass rush pressure rate (39.9%). Both those numbers were boosted by the defense's effort against a sagging Jets offense last Friday. Adding veteran Jason Pierre-Paul isn't a cure-all, but he will help the Dolphins from being forced to blitz a ton week in and week out. The Commanders offensive line has had some ugly showings lately against the Cowboys (four sacks, 49% pass rush pressure rate allowed), the Giants (four sacks, 32.7% pressure rate allowed) and the Seahawks (three sacks, 46.8% pressure rate allowed). Somehow these results are better than what they were allowing through much of the first two months of the year. Sam Howell getting the ball out faster has been a positive in this regard but a negative for his numbers in three of his past four games (the one game he did really well in was sort of fluky). The matchup is a good test for the Dolphins pass rush post-Phillips, one that it should pass without giving up much in the way of deep completions.\nSTARTS: Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, Raheem Mostert, Tua Tagovailoa, Terry McLaurin (low-end WR2), De'Von Achane (low-end RB2), Dolphins DST\nTyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, Raheem Mostert, Tua Tagovailoa, Terry McLaurin (low-end WR2), De'Von Achane (low-end RB2), Dolphins DST SITS: Sam Howell (low-end starter at best), Brian Robinson (desperation RB starter), Logan Thomas (PPR bye-week replacement), Antonio Gibson (PPR bye-week replacement), Commanders DST\nSam Howell (low-end starter at best), Brian Robinson (desperation RB starter), Logan Thomas (PPR bye-week replacement), Antonio Gibson (PPR bye-week replacement), Commanders DST SLEEPERS: Curtis Samuel (especially PPR), Jahan Dotson (non-PPR only)\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nWhen Thomas Brown took over the Panthers playcalling for three games earlier this year, the Panthers averaged a 64% pass rate, Chuba Hubbard dominated touches (two games with 17-plus touches, none with more than 10 PPR points) and Adam Thielen had a large target share (26.5%) with a tiny ADOT (4.33). In the two games since, the Panthers pass rate dipped below 60%, Hubbard shared more regularly and Thielen's ADOT nearly doubled. Hubbard had a good game last week, Thielen hasn't seen monster numbers since before the Week 7 bye. The uncertainty of how the Panthers will operate moving forward with Brown basically calling the offense without any oversight keeps these players are risky Fantasy propositions, though it helps a lot that the Buccaneers are dealing with injuries that hurt their run defense (Lavonte David and Devin White will miss the game) and keep their pass defense from improving (Jamel Dean will miss the game).\nSTARTS: Rachaad White, Mike Evans, Adam Thielen, Baker Mayfield (low-end QB1)\nRachaad White, Mike Evans, Adam Thielen, Baker Mayfield (low-end QB1) SITS: Chris Godwin (PPR flex), Cade Otton (PPR bye-week replacement), Bryce Young, Panthers DST\nChris Godwin (PPR flex), Cade Otton (PPR bye-week replacement), Bryce Young, Panthers DST SLEEPERS: Chuba Hubbard (low-end RB2\/high-end flex), Buccaneers DST\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Chris Godwin WR TB Tampa Bay \u2022 #14\nAge: 27 \u2022 Experience: 7 yrs.

Those were the days. This season he's lined up wide on 68% of his snaps. Can't help but think that's caused the massive change in his production this year -- that and his quarterback isn't a serial slot-targeter (or a Hall of Famer). Godwin's been under 60 yards in five straight, hasn't had a game with even 10 PPR points since Week 8 and has one touchdown on the year despite being tied for 12th among all NFL players in end-zone targets with nine. It gets worse: The Panthers offense can't score and their run defense is so bad, leaving pass-negative game scripts for their opponents. Just two teams (the Saints and Dolphins) have rostered multiple receivers with 10-plus PPR points against the Panthers in 2023. I'd sit Godwin for Josh Downs, Brandin Cooks, Christian Watson and Curtis Samuel (especially if PPR).\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nI wouldn't expect the Rams offensive line to handle the Browns' defensive front like they did the Cardinals' last week, but it must be mentioned that the Browns run defense isn't anywhere near as dominant as it was earlier this year. In their past three games, they gave up 4.1 yards per rush to the Ravens (just 6.3% of their runs went 10-plus yards), 7.8 yards per rush to the Steelers thanks to a long TD run by Jaylen Warren (23.8% of their runs went 10-plus yards) and 4.6 yards per rush to the Broncos (18.5% of their runs went 10-plus yards). Playing more snaps because the Browns offense has been inept isn't the reason for it either because they struggled with the run in the first half against all three teams (over 5.3 yards per carry allowed against each). It's silly to say the Rams passing game is struggling when Matthew Stafford just threw four touchdowns, but Cooper Kupp looked like he played hurt last week and Puka Nacua didn't look that much better. If they're ailing, the Rams would be smart to try and use the run game early and often.

This is actually a great thing for Cooper; over his past two weeks his ADOT sat at 7.57 yards, which was roughly half of what it was in his first nine games at 15.42 yards. Clearly, the Browns wanted Cooper to run shorter routes and make things easier on rookie QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson. I'd expect that to be out the window now -- Flacco wasn't shy about chucking the rock deep with the Jets, attempting passes of 15-plus Air Yards on 20 percent of his throws, and he had no problem focusing on one primary receiver (Garrett Wilson had 8, 14 and 11 targets in Flacco's starts). The hope is that both Flacco and Cooper are experienced and capable enough to develop rhythm to salvage the Browns passing game. It's the only thing to buy into here as the Rams have allowed the 12th fewest Fantasy points to wide receivers on the season and happen to have done well against deep throws against wide receivers (40% completion rate allowed, two touchdowns, both top six on the season). Cooper's volume should hopefully push him to a decent Fantasy stat line.

That was Kupp, who in Week 12 ran a ton of short routes and couldn't separate and didn't have much sudden movement. If he's going to come through this week it'll likely come on a ton of short targets and\/or some targets inside the 10-yard line. The fact that he has 13 total targets in his past three games combined makes it tough to buy into him suddenly getting 10-plus targets this week. The matchup is also a problem -- the Browns have the defensive backs to hang tight with a slower-than-normal Kupp in man-to-man coverage, which they play in a lot. The Browns also have the pass rush to force Matthew Stafford to get the ball out quickly and without much distance. I'm not that nervous to bench Kupp for Rashee Rice, Courtland Sutton and both of the top Seattle WRs.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nIn three games since getting Chase Young, the Niners have allowed 30 points total, yielded just 3.3 yards per rush to RBs, 5.9 yards per attempt to QBs, pressured quarterbacks at a 43.2% rate (without blitzing much!), accumulated 15 sacks and picked off four interceptions. As many problems as the Eagles present with their offense, the Niners figure to be just as menacing with their collective defense. That will make things tough for the Eagles, whose defense played over 90 snaps last Sunday and could be without a couple of starters in the front seven, and whose offense could be forced into an uncomfortable game script if the Niners build a lead. Even concepts like utilizing Jalen Hurts' mobility on downfield throws and targets to D'Andre Swift are things the Niners have dealt with successfully this season. Not that you'll sit any of your usual Eagles starters in Fantasy, but some might underwhelm given the circumstances.

The step-up in competition to the Chiefs will clearly impact him and his offensive line, which played better in their games against the Chargers and Lions. Steve Spagnuolo's defense has been blitzing its tails off over the past two weeks (nearly 50% of their snaps against the Eagles and Raiders), so the hunch is they'll apply maximum pressure to that O-line in an effort to make Love more off-target than he's been and, hopefully, get some turnovers. Only one receiver has had more than 15 PPR points against the Chiefs in their past four games (Jakobi Meyers last week), making it tough to expect grand games from Love's favorite targets.

Now they'll take on a Bengals offense that was borderline lucky to even score 10 points last week against the Steelers. Two of Ja'Marr Chase's four receptions were tipped by Steelers first, then the Bengals' longest pass play was on a designed dump-off pass to Joe Mixon for 39 yards. Jake Browning had his moments evading the pass rush but his arm strength is just not very good. Expect the Jaguars to bring plenty of heat to Browning, then lean into Travis Etienne on the ground to bring home a win.\n\nThis article, authored by Dave Richard, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-11-30 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":57}

Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.\nIt's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.\nWe'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Justin Jefferson). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.\nIt's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected strength of schedule rankings every week over at SportsLine. My objective is to break down how the schedule affects every Fantasy relevant player for the upcoming four weeks, the playoff stretch and the entire season. You'll also be able to find my key takeaways on which players you should buy low, sell high and more trade advice.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Trevor Lawrence QB JAC Jacksonville \u2022 #16\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

Buffalo is savvy when it comes to defending the pass, so I can't say they'll fall off just because star cornerback Tre'Davious White won't play, but I wonder just how effective its pass rush will be without Greg Rousseau and with a sub-100 percent Von Miller (if he plays). Lawrence is a decent starter but I'd rather roll with Anthony Richardson, Jordan Love and Justin Fields.\nLAST WEEK: Can't blame drops this time. With his top receiver blanketed thanks to a heavy dose of man coverage, and with a favorable game script, Lawrence didn't have to do too much to help the Jaguars roll past the Falcons. His TD throw off-schedule to Ridley was awesome, but Lawrence set season-lows in pass attempts (30) and throws of 10-plus Air Yards (20% rate). It's worth noting that Week 4 was the first time all year a defense chose to play significant man coverage snaps against the Jaguars.\nTHIRD DOWNS: Stunningly, Lawrence has completed just 50% of his throws here; only Geno Smith has a worse rate among qualifying quarterbacks. Lawrence is averaging 4.4 yards per attempt with a 6.9-yard Average Depth of Target (ADOT) on the money downs, both ranking bottom-six in the league. Only one pass has been dropped on third down. It's been a drain on his Fantasy production.\nPRESSURE: Lawrence is neither getting good pass protection nor thriving while under pressure. Statistically he's a mix of average and bad with his 45.7% completion rate, 6.7 yards per attempt and 14.3% off-target rate when defenders get near him. But the worst number is his EPA per dropback of minus-0.72; only Jimmy Garoppolo, Deshaun Watson and Ryan Tannehill are worse there. That means he's hurting his team more than helping when pressured. And to tie in this point with the prior one, he also happens to be among the least-blitzed quarterbacks on third downs this year.\nBILLS: Lost top cornerback Tre'Davious White to a torn Achilles last week which means some combination of Christian Benford, Dane Jackson and Kaiir Elam (who had been benched for the first four games) will work at outside cornerback with Taron Johnson in the slot. That looks good, but the Bills pass rush is among the fiercest in football with a top-10 pass rush pressure rate (38.2%) without blitzing much (15.3% blitz rate is second-lowest in football). Unfortunately, pass rush terror Greg Rousseau won't play for the Bills, lowering their dominance in this area.\nFlex Starter (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Gabe Davis WR BUF Buffalo \u2022 #13\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs.

The Jaguars have done well against deep-ball receivers but not enough to the point where benching Davis is a good idea. He's toward the top of the flex mix ahead of Tank Dell, Tutu Atwell, Christian Watson and Jerry Jeudy.\nLAST WEEK: Kept playing up to his boom\/bust ceiling by catching a long touchdown. That's three straight games with a score. It was also his third game out of four with four or fewer targets.\nBOOM\/BUST INDEED: Davis has a massive ADOT of 16.8 yards (top-10 among 96 receivers with at least 10 targets this season), but he also has a minuscule target share of 13.6% and a target per route run rate of 13.4% (86th out of those 96 receivers). He's clearly a role player with a big-time skill-set that isn't leaned on too much.\nJAGUARS: Statistically are top-three in catch rate allowed to wideouts on throws of 15-plus Air Yards (29.4%) with seven passes defensed, but dead-last in yards per catch (43.8!) and YAC\/reception (15.0!) on those passes that are completed. They have done a nice job staying close in coverage on those throws.\nZONE COVERAGE: Jacksonville ranks fifth in zone coverage rate (78.5%) and figures to play a lot of it to keep eyes on Josh Allen and deter him from throwing deep. They did the same to Patrick Mahomes in Week 2.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Dameon Pierce RB HOU Houston \u2022 #31\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ ATL ATL -2 O\/U 41.5 OPP VS RB 2nd PROJ PTS 12 RB RNK 26th YTD Stats RUYDS 181 REC 8 REYDS 68 TD 1 FPTS\/G 9.7 I genuinely believe Pierce will become a quality Fantasy starter in the near-term, but his matchup is a challenge to begin with and his offensive line makes his outlook even tougher to buy into. For now he's among the TD-needy running back tier who might only give 13 or 14 PPR points even if he does score (which no one has done against Atlanta). He's more than fine as a bye-week replacement RB (or a RB who you kind of have to start because you're thin at the position) but I'd prefer Breece Hall, Isiah Pacheco and Rhamondre Stevenson over Pierce.\nLAST WEEK: Had a touchdown called back on a short designed screen and two more runs from 10 yards or closer get blown up. But at least he began to separate from the other Texans rushers and finish with 24 carries and a catch for over 100 total yards, even if the runs weren't efficient.\nFILM: Pierce's vision and burst helped him on plays outside of the tackles and in the screen game. He also did an admirable job fighting for extra yards play after play. Houston's doing a great job utilizing him in spite of its offensive line issues, but those issues do show up frequently anytime he ran between the tackles.\nINSIDE\/OUTSIDE: In total Pierce had 4.7 yards per run on outside plays with two explosive plays and 2.8 yards per run on inside plays with zero explosives in Week 4. On the season he's been a full yard worse on outside runs and about the same on inside runs, so perhaps he and the Texans are improving on those edge plays.\nFALCONS: Have run hot and cold against the run but they've ultimately been good by virtue of their 3.8 rushing average and zero rushing touchdowns allowed to running backs this season. They gave up just three runs of 10-plus yards to RBs in their past three games (all against Jahmyr Gibbs, none to Travis Etienne or A.J. Dillon). They've also held backs to 2.7 yards per carry on edge runs while yielding 4.3 yards on carries between the tackles.\nFALCONS: Have not allowed more than 8 non-PPR\/11 PPR points to any running back so far this season.\nSit Him (Lineup Decision) Projections powered by Sportsline Tank Dell WR HOU Houston \u2022 #13\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ ATL ATL -2 O\/U 41.5 OPP VS WR 8th PROJ PTS 11 WR RNK 27th YTD Stats REC 16 TAR 24 REYDS 267 TD 2 FPTS\/G 14 Dell's upside for one huge catch keeps him in play as a middle-of-the-pack flex, but you should be willing to consider other receivers with safer floors and nearly as much upside. And if the game is low-scoring or a one-sided win for Houston (don't laugh, they just did it last week), it further lowers Dell's ceiling. I'd rather start Romeo Doubs, Christian Watson and Adam Thielen.\nLAST WEEK: The Texans didn't need him! Houston built a nice lead thanks to its defense and held on without having to throw the ball a ton.\nFILM: The Steelers really emphasized not getting beat deep by Dell, often using a safety over the top to his side of the field to deter C.J. Stroud from even thinking about throwing at him. It worked out for the Steelers because Dell had zero deep targets, and it worked for the Texans because Nico Collins beat soft coverage a bunch including on a 24-yard deep ball (Dell drew triple coverage!) and on his long touchdown score (Dell got a safety to cheat over to his side).\nFALCONS: Should be able to deploy the same type of defensive coverage with a safety cheating over to Dell's side of the field. They could also stick outside cornerback A.J. Terrell on Collins and make things a little harder on the Texans. Terrell shadowed a receiver for the first time this season in Week 4, contributing to Calvin Ridley's modest day. It ultimately would mean multiple bodies on Dell.\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Kyle Pitts TE ATL Atlanta \u2022 #8\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

But it's hard to see the good in his game so far this season beyond him finding holes in zone coverage. Jonnu even has more red-zone targets than Pitts (by one, three to two). The matchup could create some receiving opportunities, so maybe he catches five passes for 50 yards, but that's not anything to be excited about. I'd rather start Jake Ferguson, Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert.\nSneaky Sleeper (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jonnu Smith TE ATL Atlanta \u2022 #81\nAge: 28 \u2022 Experience: 7 yrs.

The hope is we keep seeing that for Smith, especially if the game is competitive like most Falcons games tend to be. He certainly hasn't done anything to lose his role. I don't mind chancing it with Smith as a streaming tight end, though I just don't have the conviction to start him over Pitts.\nLAST WEEK: Was the second time in three weeks where Smith outproduced Pitts, but the first time it was so lopsided. The difference in snaps played and routes run is marginal -- Pitts did more of both -- but Smith is taking advantage of shorter routes with a quarterback who doesn't like to challenge downfield all that much. What's more, Smith averaged more yards per catch not just in Week 4 but also in Week 2, and he was behind Pitts by less than a yard in Week 3 when both had at least eight targets.\nFILM ON PITTS: There's no change in his explosiveness whatsoever. He's running at a slower-than-expected pace, but the Jaguars still paid him plenty of attention defensively, creating a double-whammy that left him without many targets. His longest opportunity was a deep ball from Desmond Ridder that was well-placed and perfectly leapt for by Pitts, but he couldn't secure it to the ground, nor was he separated from cornerback Tyson Campbell at all. Pitts was best on shorter routes against zone coverage.\nARTHUR SMITH: Said this week that Pitts isn't at 100%, adding \" there are certain things, you see him, and he's doing really well right now and there are certain things that he can't [do well]. It's been a journey back. He's going to get there.\"\nFILM ON SMITH: From what I see, Smith is running shorter routes and is getting open faster than Pitts. That's earned him some targets from Ridder, who seemed to have better timing with Smith than Pitts. Smith is not drawing any kind of tight coverage like Pitts either, mostly because he's staying closer to the line of scrimmage. But after the catch Smith has been a handful, breaking three tackles just last week and picking up extra yards with it. He's not fast, but he's faster than Pitts, and for at least last week and Week 2 it changed the calculus for how the Falcons divvied up targets.\nTEXANS: Have had a bundle of troubles with tight ends, giving up an 84% catch rate and 6.76 YAC\/reception to the position, both bottom-six in the league. That includes allowing an 89% catch rate on 18 total targets to Colts and Jaguars' tight ends in Weeks 2 and 3 for 9.9 yards per catch and 7.2 YAC\/reception. These numbers were a byproduct of the amount of zone coverage they played against both teams, leaving the short middle of the field open. Houston has played the third-most zone coverage of any team this year and should do so again.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nFlex Starter in PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Zay Flowers WR BAL Baltimore \u2022 #4\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: Rookie We've come to love (or hate) Ravens-Steelers games for their tough defense and low-scoring battles. That might hurt Flowers' chances of scoring -- it will probably take a little luck, which isn't necessarily too big of an ask given how the Steelers secondary has played recently. If you start Flowers, you're counting on the Steelers run defense staying strong and the Ravens using Flowers to create solid plays as a run-game extension and\/or you're hoping for a splash play. That makes him a risky flex with a much safer floor in PPR than half- or non-PPR. In the catch-counting formats I'll start him over Tank Dell, the Broncos WRs, Jordan Addison and George Pickens.\nFLOWERS: Has seen his target share increase in competitive Ravens games (not like Week 4's blowout win) and especially when the Ravens run game isn't overly efficient (Weeks 1 and 3). Of his 29 targets, 18 have been on throws of 3 or fewer Air Yards and half of those have been WR screens.\nSTEELERS: Run defense has improved considerably over their past two games, giving up just 3.5 yards per tote and 2.22 yards after contact per run against the Raiders and Texans. That could open up more targets for Flowers.\nSTEELERS: Haven't seen many WR screens but the ones they've defended have yielded a pathetic 13.75 YAC\/reception. This is an exploitable play for Flowers.\nDEEP BALL: The Steelers haven't been so hot here either, allowing 16 of 33 targets of 15-plus Air Yards to be completed for 22.5 yards per catch and for three touchdowns. This is an exploitable play for Flowers, who has caught 4 of 5 deep passes for a sizzling 136 yards.\nHISTORY: In five career games against Pittsburgh, Lamar Jackson has thrown four career touchdowns. At least all of them went to his wideouts. All were in the red zone, none were on deep throws and none were on WR screens.\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Najee Harris RB PIT Pittsburgh \u2022 #22\nAge: 25 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

The Ravens have been pretty good against the run but they can give up some numbers. Harris is a volume-based back who is at best a low-end starting option given everything that's going on. I'd rather start Breece Hall, Rhamondre Stevenson, Dameon Pierce and Jaleel McLaughlin (if Javonte Williams sits out).\nLAST WEEK: Harris had his first game with over 100 total yards against the Texans and averaged 5.1 yards per rush, just shy of the season-high he technically had on six carries against the 49ers in Week 1. A 32-yard reception helped him cross the triple-digit barrier.\nHARRIS: This might shock you, but Harris is averaging 4.3 yards per run this year with a 12.2% explosive run rate. Would you believe the explosive run rate, which reflects the frequency of his 12-plus-yard runs, is fifth-best among 44 qualifying running backs?! He's also 13th in avoided tackle rate and top-10 in yards after contact per carry at 3.53.\nTOUCHDOWNS: Harris has zero. Somehow it gets worse: He has one carry inside the 15-yard line. The Steelers have run the second-fewest red-zone plays (18, one more than New England) and second-fewest plays inside the 5-yard line (two, one more than New England). The Steelers have played four games! This is nuts.\nRAVENS: Have yet to allow a rushing score to a running back this year. They've been otherwise solid against RBs, holding them to 4.0 yards per carry on the season and roughly league-average in other metrics including missed tackles (15). But just three players have averaged over 4.0 yards per carry: Joe Mixon (4.5 yards per run, didn't have 100 total yards, didn't score), Zack Moss (4.1 yards per run, ran for 122 yards on 30 carries and caught a touchdown) and Pierre Strong (9.8 yards per carry, most of it coming in garbage time last week).\nHISTORY: Harris had over 120 total yards and a touchdown in a Week 17 win in Baltimore last year. He also scored on them with exactly 50 total yards against them in at home in Week 14. He has posted at least 10 non-PPR points in 3 of 4 career games.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Miles Sanders RB CAR Carolina \u2022 #6\nAge: 26 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs.

I definitely buy into the Lions run defense to keep Sanders grounded, and his playing time seems to be slipping away. I'd rather start Jahmyr Gibbs, Dameon Pierce and Najee Harris.\nLAST WEEK: His playing time hit a season-low 43% of the snaps as he continued losing third-down work to Chuba Hubbard. It hasn't crushed his reception totals at all but it's notable that his only game with more than four grabs came with Andy Dalton under center. Sanders also played just 31% of the Panthers' second-half snaps, a big-time change after his second-half snaps were a lot closer to Hubbard's in Weeks 2 and 3.\nSANDERS: His yards per carry has tumbled like a bowling ball downstairs this season, going from 4.0 against the Falcons to 3.1 against the Saints to 2.7 against the Seahawks to 1.5 against the Vikings. Tough matchups? Sure, even including the Vikings. Doesn't mean it's not a good look.\nNOT SURPRISINGLY: Sanders has two runs of 12-plus yards through four games -- and neither went more than 15 yards. It's not all on him -- the offensive line for the Panthers barely gave him any daylight last week (and for much of the year) and defenses aren't yet scared of getting beat by Bryce Young's arm.\nLIONS: Are a tough matchup, giving up 2.9 yards per rush to running backs on the season. That ranks top-three, as does their yards before contact allowed (0.49) and runs of 10-plus yards allowed (three). Forgive them for the 2.38 yards after contact per rush allowed -- that's only fifth-best in the league. Only Kenneth Walker, on the strength of two touchdowns, has had more than five non-PPR and nine PPR points against these Lions.\nLAST YEAR: Detroit was pretty strong against the run last year when they went into Carolina and got absolutely pummeled by the Panthers run game (which included Chuba Hubbard). Coach Dan Campbell knows it -- he accepted responsibility for that loss last year claiming the Lions \"were not emotionally ready to go.\" They should be this time around. Besides, it's a different coaching staff in Carolina and, clearly, a different run game.\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jared Goff QB DET Detroit \u2022 #16\nAge: 29 \u2022 Experience: 8 yrs.

There will be temptation on his part to test Jameson Williams on deep throws, and no doubt there will be opportunities for Sam LaPorta and Josh Reynolds (and Jahmyr Gibbs, hopefully), but it's more likely Goff has a modest game at home with a couple of scores and maybe 225 yards. I'll give him the nod over Dak Prescott and Joe Burrow, but Jordan Love, Trevor Lawrence, Josh Dobbs and C.J. Stroud all have more potential to help you win.\nLAST WEEK: After an interception, Goff marched downfield and got the Lions a touchdown, then gave way to David Montgomery to pound the Packers into submission. He had his lowest number of pass attempts (28) and yards (210) this year, and threw just one touchdown for the third time in four games.\nPANTHERS: At 27.9% are dead last in pass rush pressure rate through four weeks. The only game this season when they had some pressure on a quarterback was against the Seahawks, who have a beat-up offensive line. The Lions offensive line is near full strength and have allowed Goff to be sacked five times through four games.\nQUARTERBACKS: Have failed to top 20 Fantasy points against the Panthers this season. That includes Kirk Cousins last week, who only threw 19 times in a win (and had two touchdowns but just 13 Fantasy points). Only twice has a quarterback thrown more than TWENTY passes against Carolina.\nRUNNING BACKS: Have clobbered the Panthers. For the first three weeks of the year a rusher had at least two touchdowns against the Panthers. Last week no Vikings running back did, but Alexander Mattison (5.6) and Cam Akers (8.0) each had uncharacteristically high rushing averages. Keep in mind: The Vikings have basically operated like they are allergic to running the ball UNTIL they played the Panthers.\nGOFF: Played one game last year without Amon-Ra St. Brown. He completed 26 of 39 passes for 378 yards and four touchdowns with an interceptions in a mad come-from-behind effort against the Seahawks, who won the game 48-45. It's unlikely the Panthers will force the issue on the scoreboard like the Seahawks did last season.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Rhamondre Stevenson RB NE New England \u2022 #38\nAge: 25 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

He's still a decent start ahead of Najee Harris, Khalil Herbert and Jahmyr Gibbs but I'd rather chance my lineup with someone who has upside like Jaleel McLaughlin (if Javonte Williams sits out) or Alexander Mattison.\nFILM: The numbers don't quite match the talent -- Stevenson is a capable runner with great vision, balance and power to go with good speed. He struggled on lateral runs last week and his line failed him plenty on north-south runs. Game script kept him from finding a lot of work last week (one fourth-quarter touch).\nTHIS SEASON: Stevenson has at least 16 touches in every game, which is good. Unfortunately he has yet to total 100 yards and has been under 70 yards three times, which is definitely the opposite of good.\nSTEVENSON: The Patriots front five has gone through all kinds of issues and as a result have contributed to Stevenson averaging 0.98 yards before contact per rush this season. That ranks 29th out of 44 qualifying running backs. And if you think that's bad then consider his yards after contact per rush average of 1.75, which is dead-last among those same 44 qualifiers.\nEXPLOSIVE RUNS: Stevenson has one (1) explosive carry of 12 or more yards. It was against Miami. It went 12 yards. This is a big change from 2022 when he had 21 explosive runs and an explosive run rate of 10%, which was eighth-best.\nRECEIVING: Is averaging 4.0 targets per game and catching 75% of them but is getting just 7.3 yards per catch and has one (1) explosive catch of 16 or more yards. That one went for 32 yards against the Eagles in Week 1. Since then his longest reception has been for seven yards.\nSAINTS: Are sixth-best in rushing average to RBs (3.6) and are top-10 in basically every single run defense metric you could think of, including missed tackles with just nine on the year. The only rusher to exceed 10 Fantasy points against them, PPR or not, was Derrick Henry in Week 1. He had 13 PPR points. No one's run for a touchdown on them either.\nSAINTS: Aren't quite as impressive against running backs through the air, but they're not awful. Figure them as league average across the board except in YAC\/reception (8.53), but that was due to a massive catch-and-run by Henry in Week 1. Since Week 2 their YAC\/reception has been 5.94, sixth best in that span with zero explosive pass plays allowed to RBs. So they're pretty good.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nBust Candidate (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Raheem Mostert RB MIA Miami \u2022 #31\nAge: 31 \u2022 Experience: 9 yrs.

Miami is capable of giving Mostert more short-yardage work out of the blue, but their actions over the past two weeks suggest Achane is their preferred back near the goal line. Understand the risks in starting Mostert as a No. 2 RB, who could be dog-house bound with another fumble. He's behind Isiah Pacheco and Breece Hall in my rankings but ahead of Jahmyr Gibbs, Dameon Pierce and Najee Harris. Achane is clearly far ahead of Mostert.\nLAST WEEK: Before he fumbled the ball away twice, Mostert was splitting reps with De'Von Achane in a way that was unfavorable for him. Before the Dolphins got inside the 10-yard line Mostert had a 16-to-9 edge, then Achane played every single snap inside the 10. Then after Mostert's second fumble of the half, Mostert played just nine of the remaining 35 snaps including nothing near the end zone. Coach Mike McDaniel preached the importance of his offense not having \"self-inflicted wounds\" immediately after the game.\nLAST TWO WEEKS: Achane played all but two snaps inside the 10-yard line for Miami, so that seems like a big part of his role that will stick. As for third downs, Mostert has a one-snap edge over Achane at 6 to 5, which means they're splitting those valuable touches. Overall the targets have favored Mostert only because he had more of them in Week 3 against Denver (7 to 4).\nGIANTS: Are about to get run over. Their 4.3-yard rushing average they've allowed is a shade worse than league average but they rate poorly in rushing touchdowns allowed (five), rushes of 10-plus yards allowed (14) and missed tackles on runs (24, fourth-worst in football).\nDOLPHINS: Have split the workload pretty evenly despite the snap shares morphing in Achane's favor. Last week Achane had 11 touches to Mostert's 10. The week before Achane had 22 to Mostert's 20. The week before that ... Achane wasn't a thing and Mostert had 19 touches to Salvon Ahmed's six (Achane had none). At least we can say over the past two weeks that the Dolphins have used both backs rather evenly in touches, even though WHERE they've gotten them haven't been as equal.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline DeAndre Hopkins WR TEN Tennessee \u2022 #10\nAge: 31 \u2022 Experience: 10 yrs.

I think he'll continue to see high-value targets near the end zone and, hopefully, a small uptick in targets. I'd start him as a No. 2 receiver over Terry McLaurin, any Broncos wideouts and any Packers wideouts.\nLAST WEEK: Was so close to having a monster game. He was the designed target on a trick play and saw the ball fall just past his outstretched hands in the end zone. He also had two targets inside the 10-yard line (his first two of the season) and two end-zone targets including the aforementioned trick play (his first two of the season). The heavy dose of targets inside the 10 and into the end zone are positive signs that the Titans are trying to get him going as a playmaker.\nFILM: Hopkins might be 31 years old but he moved really, really well, creating separation with outstanding footwork and having just enough speed to stay a step ahead of defenders. He got open on a handful of third-down plays when he didn't get a target last week.\nTANNEHILL: Is the top problem Hopkins has right now. Hopkins' 38-yard deep-ball catch last week could have been as many as 50 yards if Tannehill hit him in stride, and the gimmick-play touchdown would have obviously been a massive point-getter had Tannehill been slightly more on-target there. There was even a target into the end zone that was a miscommunication between Hopkins and Tannehill. On the season Tannehill has a 13% off-target rate but over the past two games that number has ballooned to 18%, which is ... yikes.\nTITANS: The second problem Hopkins has right now is a Titans offense that's stayed true to their run-first preference -- at least when they win. On the year they're throwing the ball 54.6% of the time, 10th-lowest, but in their wins they've thrown the ball 46.4% of their snaps. In losses they've thrown 64.4% of the time. The Colts are one-point home favorites, which means at minimum the game should be competitive, which does not help the pass-run ratio outlook.\nCOLTS: Are a frozen yogurt sundae of a dream matchup for Hopkins. On the season outside receivers like Hopkins have caught 72.3% of their targets for 12.7 yards per catch against the Colts. The catch rate is bottom six, the yardage rate is top-12, but the Colts defense leads the NFL in missed tackles on passing plays with 10. Indianapolis also lost their top outside corner, Dallis Flowers, to a torn Achilles. They'll roll with rookies JuJu Brents (80% catch rate allowed) and Jaylon Jones (played two snaps this season) along with already-benched second-year corner Darrell Baker (TD allowed in each of first two games) as outside cornerbacks.\nPASS RUSH: Rank fifth-worst in pass-rush pressure rate and seventh-worst in blitz rate AND might be without edge rusher Kwity Paye. The Titans are helped by the return of rookie guard Peter Skoronski and tackle Nicholas Petit-Frere.

Or Denver. Or Chicago. You get the gist. The Cardinals pass rush shouldn't be too dangerous and Burrow, now over a month into his season, figures to eventually show some signs of improvement with his health. In no way is he a must start, and there's plenty of good reason to go with Trevor Lawrence, Russell Wilson, C.J. Stroud and even Joshua Dobbs over him, but there's some mild appeal that should at least keep him in lineups over Dak Prescott and Daniel Jones.\nLAST WEEK: Looked like a quarterback playing on one leg. Burrow didn't get much into his throws, didn't challenge downfield much, got the ball out as fast as he could and was sensitive to pass rush pressure. Even when the game was in garbage time Burrow couldn't get much going.\nAIR YARDS LAST WEEK: Burrow was 1 for 4 on throws of 10-plus Air Yards and 0 for 2 on throws of 15-plus Air Yards.\nAIR YARDS THIS SEASON: Burrow has been 11 for 38 on throws of 10-plus Air Yards and 2 for 22 on throws of 15-plus Air Yards.\nTOUCHDOWNS: Burrow has thrown just two scores this season. Both came against Baltimore in Week 2, both were throws inside the five-yard line, both were to Tee Higgins. That's it. Even his red-zone stats are unfathomable -- he's completed 7 of 15 passes in the red zone. At least 9 of those 15 throws went into the end zone.\nPASS RUSH: Bengals opponents have started to sniff out Burrow's issues and have come after him. The Browns and Titans had a pass rush pressure rate between 38& and 42% in their wins over Cincy with high blitz rates (at least 31% each). Compare that to the Rams and Ravens, who barely brought pressure or blitzes and either lost or nearly lost to the Bengals.\nCARDINALS: Are dead-last in blitz rate this season (14%) and third-to-worst in pass rush pressure rate (28%). They actually had nine sacks after Weeks 1 and 2 but have had three since against the Cowboys and 49ers. Arizona seems to prefer using just four rushers to affect the quarterback, something that should be helpful to Burrow this week.\nCARDINALS: Rank eighth-worst in completion rate allowed (69.8%, though that was boosted heavily by Brock Purdy's 95% completion rate last week), and are bottom-five in both yards per catch (11.7) and missed tackles on pass plays (49!).\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nBust Candidate (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Dallas Goedert TE PHI Philadelphia \u2022 #88\nAge: 28 \u2022 Experience: 6 yrs.

It shouldn't be lost on Fantasy managers that since Swift became a staple in the Eagles offense, Goedert has taken a backseat. There's always still a shot he scores from short range, but you know how the Eagles like to run the ball when they're near the goal line. I'd rather start Jake Ferguson and Zach Ertz in all formats as well as Kyle Pitts and Cole Kmet in non-PPR.\nTHREE WEEKS IN A ROW: With seven or fewer targets, Goedert has failed to get even 50 yards receiving. His target volume dipped from seven in Weeks 2 and 3 to four in Week 4. Goedert had the same amount of targets as D'Andre Swift.\nNICK SIRIANNI: The Eagles coach again said \"[w]e need to get him the football,\" citing that plays designed for him wound up going to other Eagles because of how defenses played Goedert.\nFILM: If there's something teams are doing to take away Goedert, I didn't see it on any of his nine third-down routes last week. Goedert still looked sluggish in his movements and didn't run a ton of deeper routes, though there were a couple where he did get open but Jalen Hurts had better opportunities elsewhere.\nLAST WEEK: On the plus side, two of his targets were in the red zone and a third was a deep contested catch for 17 yards. On the downside, he dropped that fourth target on a short throw.\nGOEDERT: Has three red-zone targets and zero end-zone targets this season.\nRAMS: Got stung for two touchdowns to tight ends at Indy last week, one on a 35-yard play where Mo Alie-Cox got matched up with DE-turned-OLB Mike Hoecht. The other was a five-yard toss to Andrew Ogletree, who ran past Hoecht off the snap for an easy touchdown grab. These guys aren't considered primary tight ends like Goedert, though, so it's unlikely the Rams would cover Goedert the same way as they covered them (which is to say, they barely did).\nBEFORE WEEK 4: The Seahawks, Bengals and 49ers tight ends, including George Kittle, combined for eight non-PPR\/19 PPR Fantasy points over three games against the Rams. L.A.'s pass stats against tight ends were much better before the Colts laid some numbers on them.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jordan Addison WR MIN Minnesota \u2022 #3\nAge: 21 \u2022 Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs KC KC -4 O\/U 52.5 OPP VS WR 10th PROJ PTS 9.8 WR RNK 34th YTD Stats REC 13 TAR 20 REYDS 185 TD 2 FPTS\/G 10.9 While the Vikings are almost guaranteed to throw a ton against the Chiefs, rolling with Addison remains a risk because he's not the definitive No. 2 target, nor is the matchup any good for him. He's a flex at best who I'd sit for Romeo Doubs, Gabe Davis and Christian Watson.\nLAST WEEK: Total disaster. In a gamescript that actually gave Minnesota a chance to -- gasp! -- run the ball, Kirk Cousins barely threw the ball and Addison went catchless on one target. There was also a major reduction in snaps played, down to 58%. His season-low was 56% from Week 1.\nMATCHUP: With the Vikings capable of running the ball, the offense went with heavier formations. Backup tight end Josh Oliver played about as many snaps as he did in Week 1 and third tight end Johnny Mundt saw a season-high 17% of snaps. Week 4 was the first time all year the Vikings DIDN'T throw the ball on at least 69% of their snaps.\nTHIRD MAN: Last week did affirm that Addison may actually be the No. 3 wide receiver in the offense behind Justin Jefferson and K.J. Osborn, but even with the donut Addison still has a five-catch lead on Osborn on the season with 68 more yards gained.\nTHIS WEEK: You can bank on the Vikings reversing course against the Chiefs. Two of the past three offenses against Kansas City wound up throwing at least 71% of their snaps. The team that didn't? Chicago, who was so badly blown out by halftime that they ran the ball 55% of their second-half snaps just to get out of Arrowhead.\nCHIEFS: Have been stout against receivers all season long, ranking top-five in catch rate allowed (53.4%) and YAC\/reception allowed (2.96), and sixth-best in yards per catch given up (11.1). Even if you take out the Bears game the Chiefs have yielded a 56.8% catch rate and 2.93 YAC\/reception with a 10.9 receiving average to the Lions, Jaguars and Jets. Drill down even further and they're great against outside receivers like Addison in terms of catch rate (45.8%) and YAC\/reception (2.86), but they have allowed 15.0 yards per catch specifically to outside receivers. It's the only saving grace Addison has.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Garrett Wilson WR NYJ N.Y.

That's tough to bank on simply because Wilson has rarely thrown the ball with precision. But I like Garrett Wilson's chances of seeing a lot of targets and coming through with at least a couple of big plays against a defense that has been tied in knots for the past eight quarters. I'd start Wilson over Gabe Davis, Jakobi Meyers and any Broncos wideouts.\nLAST WEEK: A breakout of sorts as Wilson caught 9 of 14 targets to boost his PPR score, but he ultimately wound up with 60 receiving yards, his second-highest amount of the season. Wilson was real close to cashing in a 29-yard touchdown but Zach Wilson was off-target with the throw.\nZACH WILSON: Of the 36 targets Garrett Wilson has seen from Zach Wilson, 11 of them (31%) have been uncatchable. That doesn't include another three incompletions that were either thrown late or predetermined that defenses were able to sniff out.\nSILVER LINING? Garrett Wilson is clearly the alpha of the passing game, collecting at least twice as many targets this season than anyone else on the Jets.\nTHE REAL SILVER LINING: The Jets will take on a Broncos defense that has been awful to watch. No defense has allowed a higher catch rate (85.1%) or scored a worse Defensive EPA per drop back (minus-0.79) collectively to wide receivers than the Broncos. And after yielding an 86.7% catch rate ad 20.8 yards per catch to the Dolphins in Week 3, Denver turned around and let up a 92.9% catch rate and 15.6 yards per catch to the Bears in Week 4! Even top cornerback Pat Surtain has allowed a high-for-him 63% completion rate this season. Surtain allowed four catches for 56 yards over six targets in his coverage last week. It does not help that Denver's pass rush has been practically non-existent.\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Russell Wilson QB DEN Denver \u2022 #3\nAge: 35 \u2022 Experience: 12 yrs. I chose to drop Wilson in my rankings because this should be one of his toughest matchups of the season, and his reliance on outside receivers and the deep ball are at risk given this matchup. We might see a much more subdued and boring version of Wilson's game, which means he could very well wind up with a stat line like Mahomes had against the Jets last week. I'd rather start Jared Goff, Trevor Lawrence, Joshua Dobbs and C.J. Stroud.\nLAST WEEK: Was the second time in three games Wilson had 28-plus Fantasy points. It helped that he played a bad Bears defense with a beat-up secondary. His other high-score game? Week 2 against the Commanders, where he had 92 yards and a Hail Mary touchdown in the final 0:48 to boost his score an extra 9.7 Fantasy points (he still had 22.2 points without it).\nTHE JETS: Have given up over 16 Fantasy points to a quarterback ONCE all season -- Dak Prescott in Week 2. The other three they faced, including Josh Allen in Week 1 and Patrick Mahomes last Sunday, were under 16 Fantasy points.\nPASS RUSH: The Jets tend to get to the quarterback without blitzing (19.5% blitz rate is bottom-five), getting some pressure on 41.6% of their snaps so far this year, which is third-best in the league. And it's been consistent -- their only \"low\" game was at Dallas and they still bugged Prescott 32.5% of the time. That's a lot.\nO-LINE: Denver's front five allows the sixth-highest pass rush pressure rate this year at 39.5%. The Bears had pressure on 32.3% of their dropbacks against Denver last week, their second-highest of the season (they did blitz a bunch).\nWILSON: His numbers when pressured don't look bad over the course of the season, but they're weighted by his numbers against the Raiders in Week 1. In his past three games when he threw a lot against Washington, Miami and Chicago, Wilson completed 56.4% of his passes when pressured for 8.0 yards per attempt with a better-than-most 5.1% TD rate and a great off-target rate of 2.6%. Of those numbers, only his off-target rate is somehow better when pressured than not pressured; the rest are all much better when he has time. He shouldn't have much time this week.\nDEEP BALL: The Jets are also pretty good versus throws of 15-plus Air Yards, giving up just a 40.7% completion rate with four interceptions and an in-context low number of 23.1 yards per grab (seventh-best). Wilson ranks top-10 among quarterbacks in completion rate (50%) and yards per attempt (17.2) with the second-lowest off-target rate (12.5%) on those long throws but is below league-average in overall attempts. His numbers are also inflated because of that Commanders game and the Hail Mary he hit on.\nVS. OUTSIDE WRs: The Jets allow the second-highest catch rate to perimeter guys (79.4%), but they're top-five in yards per catch (10.7), ADOT (10.38) and completions allowed of 20-plus yards (three, which is best in NFL). Outside guys have also seen the third-fewest targets because teams know not to attack there.\nWILSON: 50 of his 132 passes (38%) have gone to outside receivers this year. Seven of his nine touchdowns have headed that way too. This is a problem for Wilson.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jake Ferguson TE DAL Dallas \u2022 #87\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs. The only reason to give Ferguson the nod is because he's a safety valve for Prescott to lean on. It's a volume play where you're counting on Ferguson to catch six or seven balls and average around 10 yards per catch. It makes him much more appealing in PPR than non-PPR, which is why I'm OK starting him over Dallas Goedert and Kyle Pitts.\nLAST WEEK: Was the benefactor of Dak Prescott taking what the Patriots defense gave him, mostly utilizing Ferguson as a short-area target to fire the ball to when the pressure was quick off the snap. But there were a couple of throws where Prescott read the defense well and found Ferguson for pretty good gains. All told Ferguson led the Cowboys with seven targets and seven catches for 77 yards in three quarters of work.\nTHIS WEEK: The 49ers figure to unleash its pass rush on Prescott with zone coverage behind it, which only makes sense given how Prescott has handled the pass rush pressure this year. It should mean more short throws for Ferguson.\n49ERS: Are tops in football in catch rate allowed to tight ends (48.6%) and YAC\/reception allowed (1.29 yards). They're also top-five in yards per catch (7.1). These numbers are even more amazing when you realize tight ends have averaged 8.8 targets per game against the Niners this season, third-most in football. Tyler Higbee and Darren Waller were completely humbled, but Zach Ertz had 11 PPR points last week and nearly caught a touchdown. Pat Freiermuth did catch a touchdown in Week 1 to earn him seven PPR points.\nSit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Brock Purdy QB SF San Francisco \u2022 #13\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs. It's safe to expect Purdy to feel a lot of pressure against the Cowboys, and throwing in man coverage behind it could create some havoc that could speed up Purdy. He's been so consistent and the 49ers are so loaded, but this is just one of those rare matchups where there's too much downside to buy into Purdy. After ranking him high early in the week I've moved him behind Anthony Richardson, Jordan Love and Trevor Lawrence, but still ahead of Joe Burrow, Dak Prescott and Daniel Jones.\nLAST WEEK: Purdy's been a find ever since the 49ers put him on the field but last week he executed their offense flawlessly. Seriously -- he missed on one throw. And for the second time this season, Purdy threw a pass that was ruled a lateral for a touchdown, robbing his Fantasy managers of precious points. Of course, it helped that he played Arizona, a defense that has taken a step back in pressuring quarterbacks.\nPURDY: Has hit at least 20 Fantasy points in 8 of his 9 regular-season starts, and it really should be 9 for 9 because of that first touchdown that was ruled a lateral back in Week 2. If you include the two playoff games he completed, Purdy has delivered at least 20 in 9 of 11 games. And in 5 of those 9 he hit at least 23 Fantasy points including each of his past two games.\nCOWBOYS: Dallas' defense lost top cornerback Trevon Diggs and they're still red hot. They lead the league in pass rush pressure rate this season (55.6%) and they're in the top-10 in blitz rate (31.9%). It's that pressure that's helped the Cowboys rank in the top-five in completion rate allowed (57.4%), passing touchdowns allowed (two) and missed tackles on pass plays (just five, that's best in football). Only Joshua Dobbs, who ran for 55 yards, has scored double-digit Fantasy points against the Niners (18 points). Not that the Cowboys have been tested much -- Daniel Jones, Zach Wilson and the Patriots QBs are the other guys they've man-handled.\nO-LINE: San Francisco has allowed a pass rush pressure on 36.4% of their snaps, which sounds like a lot but it's just a shade worse than league average. That number is weighted by the Giants' decision to blitz on 84.6% of Purdy's dropbacks in Week 2, creating an inflated pass rush pressure rate. Despite the Giants' efforts, Purdy still threw for 310 yards and two touchdowns in a game he didn't have Brandon Aiyuk in.\nCOWBOYS: Have become one of the most aggressive defenses in the league, ranking third from the bottom in zone coverage snaps. And truthfully, the only quarters they've actually played heavy zone have been at the end of blowout wins over the Giants and Jets. If they keep that up they'd look completely different than in their playoff meeting against Purdy in January when they played heavy zone for nearly 86% of their snaps.\nPURDY: Has been sensational against both man and zone coverages this season. His completion rate and yards per attempt are noticeably higher against zone, but four of his five passing touchdowns have come versus man coverage. However, Purdy's been at his worst when pressured (like most quarterbacks), completing 48.6% of his throws for 5.6 yards per attempt with a gaudy 18.9% off-target rate.\nLAST YEAR IN THE PLAYOFFS: The Cowboys pressured Purdy on 48.5% of his drop backs despite blitzing just 21.2% of the time. Purdy completed 65% of his throws but struggled mightily with 214 yards passing and no touchdowns.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jordan Love QB GB Green Bay \u2022 #10\nAge: 25 \u2022 Experience: 4 yrs. The Raiders' track record against QBs and Love getting Aaron Jones and Christian Watson back without snap limits are what provides the most optimism here. The return of guard Elgton Jenkins helps, too. Love has upside to get back to 25-plus Fantasy points like he had in Weeks 1-3. I'd start him over Trevor Lawrence, Joe Burrow and Jared Goff.\nLAST WEEK: Obviously the Lions pass rush was too much for him and the Packers offensive line in the first half. Motown especially played a lot of zone coverage early and Love still threw into the teeth of it. He calmed down in the second half and took more of what the Lions gave him and really got into a groove before making a bad read on a miscommunication with Romeo Doubs for his second interception.\nA POSITIVE? Despite the turmoil last week, Love had season-bests in completion rate (63.9%) and off-target throws (11.1%) while still averaging a hefty 9.5 ADOT, which was his second-lowest on the year but still above league average.\nFILM: I remember pointing out in the preseason that Love was late on a few of throws. That was the case in Week 4, but the bigger issue was passes sailing high on him because he was putting too much of his body into his throws. Combine those things with his penchant for attacking deep and it's no wonder he had a bad game. But there's something else -- Love was pass rush ignorant, meaning he didn't let the Lions' pressure scare him, even if it did wind up overwhelming him for some early-game sacks.\nRAIDERS: Deserve credit for trying -- in the past two weeks they lead the NFL in pass rush pressure rate and are 10th in blitz rate. Playing weaker offensive lines in Pittsburgh and L.A. have helped boost those numbers, but quarterbacks are still finding success to the tune of 13.9 yards per catch and 7.07 YAC\/reception over those two games, both bottom-three in the league. And, both quarterbacks the Raiders played in Weeks 3 and 4 each posted at least 22 Fantasy points (Kenny Pickett, Justin Herbert without his second-best receiver and without his top running back).\nRAIDERS: The hunch is the Raiders will keep bringing the blitz and play a lot of gutsy man coverage behind it. They've been playing more man coverage in two of their past three games and have really only moved to heavy zone against the Broncos in Week 1.\nLOVE: Has been a mixed bag against man coverage -- his completion rate has been terrible at 39.4%, but his touchdown rate has been outstanding (12.1%). Plus more man coverage and more blitzing could result in more rushing for Love, which he's shown he's willing to do.\nStart 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em\nBust Candidate (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Justin Fields QB CHI Chicago \u2022 #1\nAge: 24 \u2022 Experience: 3 yrs.

The deep-ball opportunities are a huge plus if Fields has good protection like he had last week. But if the short-week preparation doesn't scare you a little, his lack of rushing should since we're effectively starting him only for his passing chops. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. Anthony Richardson and Jordan Love have more potential than Fields this week, but guys like Russell Wilson, Trevor Lawrence, Dak Prescott and Jared Goff don't. You just might not have a better option than Fields.\nLAST WEEK: Posted his first-ever game with four passing touchdowns and over 300 yards against a Broncos defense that was devoid of a serious pass rush or pass coverage skills through the first three quarters. By the fourth quarter the Broncos were generating heavy pressure and Fields finished 5 of 11 for 50 yards and no touchdowns with two turnovers.\nFILM: For three quarters Fields looked terrific firing downfield from clean pockets with plenty of great reads and accurate throws along with a play or two where he manipulated defenders with the threat of him running only to throw over their heads, including on Kmet's short touchdown. His off-target rate was literally 0.0%. But by the fourth only some plays were fine -- on others he either was pressured, threw off his back foot, threw with too much velocity or wasn't on the same page as his target. His off-target rate in the fourth was 9.1%, which was closer to what he had averaged in his first three games (13.6%).\nBRONCOS: Have allowed season-best Fantasy numbers to each of the past three quarterbacks they've played this season. They're a terrific matchup for anybody right now. Remember this when we talk about the Jets.\nCOMMANDERS: Sport a slightly below-average pass rush pressure rate thanks to only one game all year with a rate over 30% (52.7% at Denver, and Wilson still had a great game even if you take away a Hail Mary touchdown catch). They rank seventh in sacks (13) and 13h in pressures (53), which again floats around league average.\nBEARS: Rank league-worst in pass rush pressure rate allowed at 47.4% of their snaps -- nearly one out of every two drop backs is pressured. Bringing back guard Teven Jenkins might help a little, but they're still a struggling unit.\nDEEP BALL: Washington ranks bottom-five in attempts, yards per catch and touchdowns allowed on pass plays of 15-plus Air Yards over the past three weeks. This is an area Fields can exploit -- he's tied for the most touchdowns on throws of 15-plus Air Yards this season than Fields with four and is around league-average in completion rate, attempts per game and Expected Points Added (EPA) per drop back.\nLAST SEASON: Washington got a season-best 57.1% pass rush pressure rate on Fields and blitzed him on 40.5% of his drop backs. Fields had one passing touchdown and one interception and still had nearly 20 Fantasy points because he ran for 88 yards.\nRUSHING: Fields followed up a Week 3 game with seven designed runs with just two designed runs in Week 4 for two total yards. On the season he's totaled 28 rushes for 134 yards and a score.\nSneaky Sleeper (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Sam Howell QB WAS Washington \u2022 #14\nAge: 23 \u2022 Experience: 2 yrs.

While there's potential for that on Thursday, it's not a certainty. Howell could just as easily put up nominal stats to help the Commanders bring home a win. With upside an issue, think of Howell as a sleeper with 20-point potential. I'd rather start Jordan Love, Jared Goff or Justin Fields, but taking Howell over Dak Prescott and Joe Burrow isn't crazy given their matchups and\/or situations.\nLAST WEEK: Bounced back from a horrid four-INT loss in Week 3 to complete nearly 71% of his throws for 290 yards with one touchdown and a very clutch 40 rushing yards at Philly. This was the most efficient game of his young career, but it was also the busiest game of his career as he threw 41 passes and ran six times. Playing into overtime helped his cause.\nHOWELL: Has one game out of five as a pro with multiple passing touchdowns, and two others with one rushing and one passing score.\nBEARS: Are one of the easiest matchups for a quarterback. They rank in the bottom-seven in completion rate allowed (70.1%), yards per catch allowed (12.2), Yards After Catch per reception (YAC\/reception) allowed (6.26, second-most) and missed tackles (52). One more factor: Chicago ranks poorly in pass rush pressure rate, blitz rate and has just two sacks all season.\nHOWELL: When not pressured has completed 73.8% of his throws for 7.2 yards per attempt with a 9.7% off-target rate. None of these are particularly impressive -- they're all about league-average -- but that's still a plus for Howell considering this week's matchup.\nPASS ATTEMPTS: Through four weeks the Bears are seeing an average of 31.8 pass attempts against them per game. Even in a game the Bears led for much of last week, the Broncos tried just 28 throws. On the flip side, three of the four quarterbacks Chicago faced found three touchdowns on their limited throws.\nStart Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Terry McLaurin WR WAS Washington \u2022 #17\nAge: 28 \u2022 Experience: 5 yrs.

He's a low-end WR2 worth the nod over George Pickens, Zay Flowers, Drake London and Jahan Dotson.\nPAST THREE WEEKS: McLaurin has led all Commanders wide receivers in targets and all Commanders players in receptions. He's the No. 1 guy, and his big Week 4 game (8-86-0 with an offensive fumble recovery for a touchdown) would have been even bigger if Sam Howell had better ball placement on a deep pass McLaurin was open for.\nBEARS: Are expected to play again without top outside cornerback Jaylon Johnson and safety Eddie Jackson. Not that those two absences led to a bonanza from Broncos receivers; Russell Wilson spread the ball around. But if McLaurin remains the target leader then he'll have the best shot at a big game. Rookies Tyrique Stevenson and Terell Smith figure to line up across from McLaurin the most.\nMATCHUPS: Each top-target earning wide receiver that plays mostly outside (like McLaurin) has found at least 10 PPR points in every game against the Bears. That includes Rashee Rice in Week 3 (7 targets, 5-59-0), Courtland Sutton in Week 4 (5 targets, 3-27-1), Romeo Doubs in Week 1 (5 targets, 4-26-2) and Mike Evans in Week 2 (8 targets, 6-171-1).

She doesn't meet anybody, or at least she didn't want to meet me, so I took it personal,\" Kelce said on an episode of the \"New Heights\" podcast he does with his brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce.\nHe revealed that he made a friendship bracelet, a fan tradition at her concerts, with his number on it to give to her, seemingly expressing his interest in Swift. When his brother asked if it was his jersey number or his phone number, Kelce replied, \"you know which one.\"\n\"If you're up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets and I had received a bunch of them, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.\"\nAug. 5: Kelce names his celebrity crush\nWell before the two were rumored to be dating, Kelce was asked his crush.

Especially when you got Jason Kelce on live television telling people just both sides.\"\nHe then admitted that he invited Swift to one of his games, joking that they would compete to see who put on the bigger show at Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Chiefs.\n\"I threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court and I told her you know, I've seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one is a little more lit.
