{"title":"Robotics Q&A with Boston Dynamics\u2019 Aaron Saunders","context":"## Robotics Q&A with Boston Dynamics\u2019 Aaron Saunders\n\nFor the next few weeks, TechCrunch\u2019s robotics newsletter Actuator will be running Q&As with some of the top minds in robotics. Subscribe here for future updates.\nPart 1: CMU\u2019s Matthew Johnson-Roberson\nPart 2: Toyota Research Institute\u2019s Max Bajracharya and Russ Tedrake\nPart 3: Meta\u2019s Dhruv Batra\nThis time it\u2019s Boston Dynamics CTO, Aaron Saunders. He has been with the company for more than 20 years, most recently serving as its vice president of Engineering.\nWhat role(s) will generative AI play in the future of robotics?\nThe current rate of change makes it hard to predict very far into the future. Foundation models represent a major shift in how the best machine learning models are created, and we are already seeing some impressive near-term accelerations in natural language interfaces. They offer opportunities to create conversational interfaces to our robots, improve the quality of existing computer vision functions and potentially enable new customer-facing capabilities such as visual question answering. Ultimately we feel these more scalable architectures and training strategies are likely to extend past language and vision into robotic planning and control. Being able to interpret the world around a robot will lead to a much richer understanding on how to interact with it. It\u2019s a really exciting time to be a roboticist!\nWhat are your thoughts on the humanoid form factor?\nHumanoids aren\u2019t necessarily the best form factor for all tasks. Take Stretch, for example \u2014 we originally generated interest in a box-moving robot from a video we shared of Atlas moving boxes. Just because humans can move boxes doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re the best form factor to complete that task, and we ultimately designed a custom robot in Stretch that can move boxes more efficiently and effectively than a human. With that said, we see great potential in the long-term pursuit of general-purpose robotics, and the humanoid form factor is the most obvious match to a world built around our form. We have always been excited about the potential of humanoids and are working hard to close the technology gap.\nFollowing manufacturing and warehouses, what is the next major category for robotics?\nThose two industries still stand out when you look at matching up customer needs with the state of art in technology. As we fan out, I think we will move slowly from environments that have determinism to those with higher levels of uncertainty. Once we see broad adoption in automation-friendly industries like manufacturing and logistics, the next wave probably happens in areas like construction and healthcare. Sectors like these are compelling opportunities because they have large workforces and high demand for skilled labor, but the supply is not meeting the need. Combine that with the work environments, which sit between the highly structured industrial setting and the totally unstructured consumer market, and it could represent a natural next step along the path to general purpose.\nHow far out are true general-purpose robots?\nThere are many hard problems standing between today and truly general-purpose robots. Purpose-built robots have become a commodity in the industrial automation world, but we are just now seeing the emergence of multi-purpose robots. To be truly general purpose, robots will need to navigate unstructured environments and tackle problems they have not encountered. They will need to do this in a way that builds trust and delights the user. And they will have to deliver this value at a competitive price point. The good news is that we are seeing an exciting increase in critical mass and interest in the field. Our children are exposed to robotics early, and recent graduates are helping us drive a massive acceleration of technology. Today\u2019s challenge of delivering value to industrial customers is paving the way toward tomorrow\u2019s consumer opportunity and the general purpose future we all dream of.\nWill home robots (beyond vacuums) take off in the next decade?\nWe may see additional introduction of robots into the home in the next decade, but for very limited and specific tasks (like Roomba, we will find other clear value cases in our daily lives). We\u2019re still more than a decade away from multifunctional in-home robots that deliver value to the broad consumer market. When would you pay as much for a robot as you would a car? When it achieves the same level of dependability and value you have come to take for granted in the amazing machines we use to transport us around the world.\nWhat important robotics story\/trend isn\u2019t getting enough coverage?\nThere is a lot of enthusiasm around AI and its potential to change all industries, including robotics. Although it has a clear role and may unlock domains that have been relatively static for decades, there is a lot more to a good robotic product than 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s. For AI to achieve the physical embodiment we need to interact with the world around us, we need to track progress in key technologies like computers, perception sensors, power sources and all the other bits that make up a full robotic system. The recent pivot in automotive towards electrification and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is quickly transforming a massive supply chain. Progress in graphics cards, computers and increasingly sophisticated AI-enabled consumer electronics continues to drive value into adjacent supply chains. This massive snowball of technology, rarely in the spotlight, is one of the most exciting trends in robotics because it enables small innovative companies to stand on the backs of giants to create new and exciting products.\n\nThis article, authored by Brian Heater, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-09 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":420}
{"title":"Robot startups see huge market in replacing human workers: 'We can sell millions of humanoids, billions maybe'","context":"## Robot startups see huge market in replacing human workers: 'We can sell millions of humanoids, billions maybe'\n\nBuilding a robot that\u2019s both human-like and useful is a decades-old engineering dream inspired by popular science fiction.\nWhile the latest artificial intelligence craze has sparked another wave of investments in the quest to build a humanoid, most of the current prototypes are clumsy and impractical, looking better in staged performances than in real life. That hasn\u2019t stopped a handful of startups from keeping at it.\n\u201cThe intention is not to start from the beginning and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re trying to make a robot look like a person,\u2019\u201d said Jonathan Hurst, co-founder and chief robot officer at Agility Robotics. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make robots that can operate in human spaces.\u201d\nDo we even need humanoids? Hurst makes a point of describing Agility\u2019s warehouse robot Digit as human-centric, not humanoid, a distinction meant to emphasize what it does over what it\u2019s trying to be.\nWhat it does, for now, is pick up tote bins and move them. Amazon announced in October it will begin testing Digits for use in its warehouses, and Agility opened an Oregon factory in September to mass produce them.\nDigit has a head containing cameras, other sensors and animated eyes, and a torso that essentially works as its engine. It has two arms and two legs, but its legs are more bird-like than human, with an inverted knees appearance that resembles so-called digitigrade animals such as birds, cats and dogs that walk on their toes rather than on flat feet.\nRival robot-makers, like Figure AI, are taking a more purist approach on the idea that only true humanoids can effectively navigate workplaces, homes and a society built for humans. Figure also plans to start with a relatively simple use case, such as in a retail warehouse, but aims for a commercial robot that can be \u201citerated on like an iPhone\u201d to perform multiple tasks to take up the work of humans as birth rates decline around the world.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough people doing these jobs, so the market\u2019s massive,\u201d said Figure AI CEO Brett Adcock. \u201cIf we can just get humanoids to do work that humans are not wanting to do because there\u2019s a shortfall of humans, we can sell millions of humanoids, billions maybe.\u201d\nAt the moment, however, Adcock\u2019s firm doesn\u2019t have a prototype that\u2019s ready for market. Founded just over a year ago and after having raised tens of millions of dollars, it recently revealed a 38-second video of Figure walking through its test facility in Sunnyvale, California.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk is also trying to build a humanoid, called Optimus, through the electric car-maker\u2019s robotics division, but a hyped-up live demonstration last year of the robot\u2019s awkwardly halting steps didn\u2019t impress experts in the robotics field. Seemingly farther along is Tesla\u2019s Austin, Texas-based neighbor Apptronik, which unveiled its Apollo humanoid in an August video demonstration.\nAll the attention \u2014 and money \u2014 poured into making ungainly humanoid machines might make the whole enterprise seem like a futile hobby for wealthy technologists, but for some pioneers of legged robots it\u2019s all about what you learn along the way.\n\u201cNot only about their design and operation, but also about how people respond to them, and about the critical underlying technologies for mobility, dexterity, perception and intelligence,\u201d said Marc Raibert, the co-founder of Boston Dynamics, best known for its dog-like robots named Spot.\nRaibert said sometimes the path of development is not along a straight line. Boston Dynamics, now a subsidiary of carmaker Hyundai, experimented with building a humanoid that could handle boxes.\n\u201cThat led to development of a new robot that was not really a humanoid, but had several characteristics of a humanoid,\u201d he said via an emailed message. \u201cBut the changes resulted in a new robot that could handle boxes faster, could work longer hours, and could operate in tight spaces, such as a truck. So humanoid research led to a useful non-humanoid robot.\u201d\nSome startups aiming for human-like machines focused on improving the dexterity of robotic fingers before trying to get their robots to walk.\nWalking is \u201cnot the hardest problem to solve in humanoid robotics,\u201d said Geordie Rose, co-founder and CEO of British Columbia, Canada-based startup Sanctuary AI. \u201cThe hardest problem is the problem of understanding the world and being able to manipulate it with your hands.\u201d\nSanctuary\u2019s newest and first bipedal robot, Phoenix, can stock shelves, unload delivery vehicles and operate a checkout, early steps toward what Rose sees as a much longer-term goal of getting robots to perceive the physical world to be able to reason about it in a way that resembles intelligence. Like other humanoids, it\u2019s meant to look endearing, because how it interacts with real people is a big part of its function.\n\u201cWe want to be able to provide labor to the world, not just for one thing, but for everybody who needs it,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThe systems have to be able to think like people. So we could call that artificial general intelligence if you\u2019d like. But what I mean more specifically is the systems have to be able to understand speech and they need to be able to convert the understanding of speech into action, which will satisfy job roles across the entire economy.\u201d\nAgility\u2019s Digit robot caught Amazon\u2019s attention because it can walk and also move around in a way that could complement the e-commerce giant\u2019s existing fleet of vehicle-like robots that move large carts around its vast warehouses.\n\u201cThe mobility aspect is more interesting than the actual form,\u201d said Tye Brady, Amazon\u2019s chief technologist for robotics, after the company showed it off at a media event in Seattle.\nRight now, Digit is being tested to help with the repetitive task of picking up and moving empty totes. But just having it there is bound to resurrect some fears about robots taking people\u2019s jobs, a narrative Amazon is trying to prevent from taking hold.\nAgility Robotics co-founder and CEO Damion Shelton said the warehouse robot is \u201cjust the first use case\u201d of a new generation of robots he hopes will be embraced rather than feared as they prepare to enter businesses and homes.\n\u201cSo in 10, 20 years, you\u2019re going to see these robots everywhere,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cForever more, human- centric robots like that are going to be part of human life. So that\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\u2014-\nAP writer Haleluya Hadero contributed to this report.\n\nThis article, authored by Matt O'Brien, The Associated Press, was published by Fortune on 2023-11-05 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":421}

The trade market is also expected to be active once more dominoes fall, with Dylan Cease, Corbin Burnes and Tyler Glasnow among starters who could be moved this winter.\nThe Winter Meetings are over, but because of the timeline of major decisions by Ohtani and Yamamoto, there could be a flurry of activity leading up to the end of the year.\nMORE: Why Shohei Ohtani signed with Dodgers over Blue Jays, other suitors\nSporting News is tracking the rumors, signings and trades as MLB free agency continues. Follow along below for the latest news.\nMLB free agency tracker, live updates\nPadres ink five-year deal with NPB star Matsui\nDate: Saturday, Dec. 23\nSource: ESPN's Jeff Passan\nAnother Japanese star is headed to the Sunshine State. Star reliever Yuki Matsui inked a five-year, $28 million deal to join the Friars on Saturday. Matsui was one of NPB's best arms out the pen, starring for Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles for nearly a decade. He tallied up 236 saves over the course of his career, posting a 2.40 ERA in 659.2 innings of work. The contract features opt-out clauses in Years 4 and 5, offering San Diego an out if Matsui deals with elbow trouble.\nDodgers sign Yamamoto to $325 million contract\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 19\nSource: ESPN's Jeff Passan, YES Network's Jack Curry\nThe Yamamoto sweepstakes are over, as the Dodgers have reportedly signed the Japanese ace to a 12-year, $325 million. It's the largest MLB deal for a pitcher, surpassing Gerrit Cole's deal with the Yankees by $1 million. Los Angeles' incredible offseason continues, as Yamamoto joins Shohei Ohtani on the defending NL West champs.\nGiants out of Yamamoto sweepstakes\nDate: Thursday, Dec. 21\nSource: Alex Pavlovic, NBC Sports Bay Area\nThe Giants made a hard push to land Yamamoto, but according to NBC Sports Bay Area's Alex Pavlovic, San Francisco has been notified that the team is out of the bidding to land the Japanese ace. Pavlovic added that it is very likely that Yamamoto ends up either in Los Angeles with the Dodgers, or New York with the Mets or Yankees.\nYamamoto met with Giants, won't decide on team until after Christmas\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 19\nSource: Andrew Baggarly, The Athletic and Bob Klapisch, Newark Star-Ledger\nSan Francisco has been among the teams most heavily believed to be in on Yamamoto, and according to The Athletic's Andrew Baggarly, the team met with him in San Francisco last week. Baggarly reported the Giants have been willing to \"blow teams out of the water\" to land Yamamoto, but noted he believes the crowded picture for the Japanese ace could make it more challenging for the Giants to be the winner of the Yamamoto sweepstakes.\nAnd fans will have to wait a bit longer before hearing a final resolution on his decision. The Newark Star-Ledger's Bob Klapisch reported Yamamoto isn't expected to make a decision until after Christmas, and that it could run until around Jan. 1-4.\nPirates re-sign franchise legend Andrew McCutchen\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 19\nSource: Jason Mackey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nThe Pirates have been making a few veteran free-agent signings to bolster the rotation. Now, they're bringing back a franchise icon. Pittsburgh has reportedly inked Andrew McCutchen to a one-year, $5 million.\nMcCutchen enjoyed a solid return to Pittsburgh in 2023, slashing .256\/.378\/.397 with 12 home runs in 112 games. It was his first season in Pittsburgh since 2017.\nAngels discussing Blake Snell\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 19\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nThe Angels came up empty on bringing back Ohtani. Now, they're looking to land another splashy name on the free-agent market. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported Los Angeles has had discussions with two-time Cy Young winner Blake Snell.\nPer Morosi, the Angels are not believed to be a strong contender for Yamamoto, thus allowing them to put more of an effort on landing Snell rather than waiting for Yamamoto to make a decision.\nCody Bellinger looking for package starting at $200 million\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 18\nSource: Jesse Rogers, ESPN\nWith Ohtani signed to Los Angeles, Bellinger remains the top free-agent bat on the market. And he is clearly looking for a top-of-the-market contract. Rogers reported sources indicate Bellinger's agent, Scott Boras, is seeking a deal worth well over $200 million for Bellinger, with one source saying he is \"not budging.\"\nRogers went on to note that some believe the Cubs won't be a team willing to pay a player that type of money until he's 40 years old, while a team like the Blue Jays might given their desperation to round out the roster.\nPadres closing in on contract for Yuki Matsui\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 18\nSource: Yuki Yamada, Sankei Sports\nThe Padres are nearing a deal for one of the top Japanese pitchers on the market. Per Sankei Sports' Yuki Yamada, the Padres are \"close to signing\" Rakuten Golden Eagles' reliever Yuki Matsui to a deal. In 10 years in Nippon Professional Baseball, Matsui has a 2.40 ERA across 659.2 innings of work. In 2023, he posted a 1.57 ERA in 57.1 innings and racked up 39 saves for the Golden Eagles.\nGiants ink catcher Tom Murphy to two-year contract\nDate: Monday, Dec. 18\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic\nThe Giants are adding some catching depth. The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reported San Francisco has agreed to a two-year, $8 million contract with the Giants.

He joins a catching room that also features breakout 2023 rookie Patrick Bailey and Joey Bart. Bart is out of minor-league options, and could be on the outside-looking-in to a 2024 Opening Day roster spot if the Giants decide to have only two catchers on the active roster.\nPirates add to rotation, sign Martin Perez\nDate: Monday, Dec. 18\nSource: Jason Mackey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nPittsburgh continues to add to its rotation this offseason. The Pirates have reportedly agreed to a one-year, $8 million deal with former Ranger starter Martin Perez. He was used as a swing man in 2023, making 20 starts and 35 total appearances, pitching to a 4.45 ERA with 93 strikeouts and 49 walks in 141.2 innings en route to winning a WorldSeries ring. The Pirates also added another left-hander who pitched in 2023 for an AL West team in Marco Gonzales, though he had an offseason stop in Atlanta in the middle.\nBidding for Yamamoto begins Monday\nDate: Monday, Dec. 18\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\nThere has been plenty of speculation about offers sent over to Yamamoto to this point, but Passan reports he has yet to receiver any formal offers. However, that will start to change on Monday, with the bidding slated to begin.\nBraves cut Matt Carpenter after trying to trade him\nDate: Monday, Dec. 18\nSource: Robert Murray, FanSided\nAtlanta reportedly was hoping to trade Matt Carpenter after acquiring him in a deal earlier this offseason from the Padres. The team acquired him and took on $4 million along with trading for Ray Kerr, but was looking to deal away his contract to someone else, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal.\nTwins could trade Max Kepler, Jorge Polance\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 17\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nThe Twins are coming off an AL Central title, but could be looking to deal away two of their key players form the team. Max Kepler and Jorge Polanco could both reportedly be on the trade market, per MLB Network's Jon Morosi, though their market could hinge on the status of other infield free agents.\nKepler appeared in 130 games for the Twins, and posted an impressive .260\/.332\/.484 slash line with 24 homers for Minnesota. Polanco was moved to an infield utility role with Edouard Julien and Royce Lewis emerging into regulars, but was still solid in 80 games, logging a .255\/.335\/.454 slash with 14 homers.\nYamamoto requests meeting with Yankees\nDate: Sunday, Dec. 17\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\nYamamoto has been making the rounds with MLB teams, and per Heyman, he reportedly asked to meet with the Yankees for a second time.

The total commitments are now up to $82 million.\nTyler Glansow inks extension with Dodgers\nDate: Friday, Dec. 15\nSource: ESPN's Jeff Passan\nThe only question mark left in the Glasnow trade was the figures on the extension he'd wind up signing with the Dodgers. Now, the numbers are in, and the deal is set to be completed.\nPer Passan, Glasnow will be signing a five-year, $135 million deal with the Dodgers. Passan reported the deal begins in 2024, and could reach up to $145 million if the Dodgers pick up a $30 million option at the end of the contract. He also reported that unlike Ohtani's deal, there will be no deferred money.\nTyler Glasnow traded to Dodgers from Rays\nDate: Thursday, Dec. 14\nSource: ESPN's Jeff Passan\nAs had been reported for a few days, the deal between the Dodgers and Rays for Tyler Glasnow is coming to fruition. Los Angeles has reportedly acquired the right-handed starting pitcher, along with outfielder Manuel Margot, for RHP Ryan Pepiot and OF Jonny Deluca.\nGlasnow is expected to sign a contract extension with the Dodgers as a result of the trade. The 30-year-old is in the final year of a two-year deal he sinked with the Rays in 2023, and was set to be free agent in 2025.\nJack Flaherty signs with Tigers\nDate: Thursday, Dec. 14\nSource:ESPN's Jeff Passan\nJack Flaherty has a new home. The right hander is signing a one-year, $14 million deal with the Tigers, according to Passan.\nAfter undergoing shoulder surgery in 2022, Flaherty was traded from the Cardinals to the Orioles last year at the 2023 deadline. In total, he made 27 starts last year, posting a 4.99 ERA with 148 strikeouts in 144.1 innings.\nYoshinobu Yamamoto meets with Phillies\nDate: Thursday, Dec. 14\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\nThe Phillies have not been one of the more frequent names connected to Yamamoto, however the Japanese free agent reportedly met with the team. The starting pitcher has met with a number of teams, including the Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Red Sox.\nPhiladelphia re-signed ace Aaron Nola this offseason, bringing back the powerful duo of Nola and Zack Wheeler. Adding Yamamoto would immediately give the Phillies' one of the best rotations in baseball.\nCubs, Blue Jays the favorites for Cody Bellinger\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 13\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\nThe Blue Jays and Cubs were believed to be among the favorites to land Ohtani. But with the star two-way talent off to Los Angeles, the two are now believed to be the favorites to land Cody Bellinger, according to Heyman.\nBellinger would be returning to the Cubs, the team with which he rebuilt his value after a down year with the Dodgers. If he signed with the Blue Jays, he'd be bringing the powerful left-handed bat the team sought when it pursued Ohtani.\nDodgers send stars to meet with Yamamoto\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 13\nSource: Fabian Ardaya, The Athletic\nThe Dodgers added one Japanese star this offseason. They're now looking to add another. Los Angeles reportedly sent Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Will Smith to meet with Yamamoto, trying to convince the standout starting pitcher to join the National League superpower.\nSigning Yamamoto would be a major boost for the Dodgers, who still have a need at starting pitcher.\nRays-Dodgers working on a Tyler Glasnow trade\nDate: Wednesday, Dec. 13\nSource: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic\nThe Rays and Dodgers are reportedly working on a trade that would send starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow to L.A. Rosenthal reports that the proposed deal would also include OF Manny Margot going to the Dodgers, while the Rays would receive RHP Ryan Pepiot and OF Jonny Deluca.\nRosenthal clarified that the deal is not complete and changes are possible, but the base of the deal is Glasnow to the Dodgers.\nRowdy Tellez inks one-year deal with Pirates\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 12\nSource: Robert Murray, FanSided\nThe Pirates have agreed to a one-year, $3.2 million contract with Rowdy Tellez. The deal includes an additional $800,000 in incentives.\nTellez hit 35 home runs as a centerpiece of the Brewers' lineup in 2022, but he took a significant step back in 2023 after starting the season on a roll. Between first base and the DH role, however, the Pirates figure to give Tellez near-everyday playing time in hopes his power bat finds its form.\nGiants, Jung-Hoo Lee agree to six-year deal\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 12\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\nThe Giants have struggled to land big-name free agents over the last two offseasons, but they reeled in a pretty significant fish on Tuesday by inking Korean outfielder Jung-Hoo Lee to a six-year, $113M contract. Lee can opt out after 2027.\nLee is just 25 and was an on-base machine in Korea, batting .340 in his KBO career. While his power was inconsistent between seasons, Lee was a sought-after bat in free agency and drew heavy interest from the Padres as well.\nDodgers meeting with Yamamoto on Tuesday\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 12\nSource: Russell Dorsey, Bally Sports\nBally Sports' Russell Dorsey reports the Dodgers met with Yoshinobu Yamamoto on Tuesday, extending Yamamoto's free agent four.\nYamamoto has already met with four teams and still plans to meet with the Red Sox and Blue Jays in the coming days.\nRoyals finalizing deal with SP Seth Lugo\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 12\nSource: Anne Rogers, MLB.com\nThe Royals and starter Seth Lugo are finalizing a 3-year, $45 million contract, according to MLB.com's Anne Rogers.\nThe Padres stretched Lugo back into a full-time starter in 2023, and the 34-year-old posted a 3.57 ERA across 146.1 innings. Kansas City can use plenty of rotation help after a dismal 2023 season, so Lugo figures to be one of the Royals' top arms in 2024 and perhaps beyond.\nYamamoto to meet with Red Sox, Blue Jays\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 12\nSource: Mark Feinsand, MLB.com\nMLB.com's Mark Feinsand reports Japanese ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto will meet with both the Red Sox and Blue Jays in the coming days.\nYamamoto has already met with the Mets, Giants and Yankees, with the Dodgers also believed to be involved in the bidding.

{"title":"Unraveling Potential Reasons Why the Dodgers May Not Pursue Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout in Free Agency Despite Their Availability","context":"## Unraveling Potential Reasons Why the Dodgers May Not Pursue Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout in Free Agency Despite Their Availability\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels have gone through a tough year. After a heartbreaking 2023 season, they now have to cope with the impending exit of their star two-way star, Shohei Ohtani. The team is also open to trading their nine-time Silver Slugger hitter Mike Trout, should he request it. In a huge miss, a team that couldn\u2019t do well even with two of the league\u2019s biggest talents on their roster may lose said stars at the same time. Will they choose to stay in LA?\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nThe Halos\u2019 cross-town rivals, the Los Angeles Dodgers, have been eyeing the dynamic Troutani duo for a long time. However, despite fans\u2019 expectations, the Dodgers\u2019 Ohtani-Trout conquest might not take place\u2014and for good reasons.\nDo the Dodgers have the budget to afford Ohtani and Trout on the same roster?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nShohei Ohtani\u2019s next projected contract value is predicted to be around $500\u2013$600 million. If it goes through, he will break Trout\u2019s biggest MLB deal record of 12 years, $426.5 million. Now, we all know that the Dodgers have deep pockets; they have managed to maintain quite a costly lineup this season valued at $283 million. But can they afford two of baseball\u2019s biggest superstars at full value?\nNow, with Trout\u2019s $426.5 million tagline, the slugger has an annual salary of about $35.45 million. He still has seven years left on his Angels contract, so get him in blue, the Dodgers will have to pay $248.15 million plus any extension value. Shohei Ohtani\u2019s predicted $535 million for 11 years (according to a Sports Illustrated segment) will bring the Dodgers down to pay him a good $48.63 million annually.\nThe Dodgers already have six players whom they have to pay above $10 million a year: Freddie Freeman ($27 million), Mookie Betts ($25 million), Clayton Kershaw ($20 million), Chris Taylor ($15 million), Max Muncy ($13.5 million), and J.D. Martinez ($10 million). Among the top-paid players, Clayton Kershaw is exiting the team this season. That, along with a few other player offloads, will free up enough space in the Dodgers payroll to support two $25 million or three $10 million p\/a players on their team. Neither Trout nor Ohtani falls within that price range, so keeping both together at the same time would not be a feasible option for the Dodgers right now.\nPitchers or Hitters? Who Will the Dodgers Prioritize This Free Agency?\nThe Dodgers have been in dire need of pitchers for a few seasons. Their current highest strikeout rate by a pitcher in a single postseason is 137 SOs by Clayton Kershaw, followed by 119 SOs by Bobby Miller and 117 SOs by Julio Urias. With Shohei Ohtani\u2019s high strikeout rate of 167 this season, he\u2019ll be an invaluable addition to the team. However, there\u2019s a little hiccup that could keep that from happening.\nOhtani will not be available to pitch throughout the 2024 season due to an elbow ligament injury he\u2019s currently recovering from. Given the pitcher\u2019s unavoidable absence, it will not be advisable for the Dodgers to hire him until 2025. Yes, Ohtani does have magnificent hitting form as well. However, the team already has hitters like Freeman and Betts, who have scored 211 and 179 hits this regular season, respectively. Speaking of hitters, why will they still want Trout to join the team despite having better-than-average hitters on the team?\nWhy will the Dodgers sign an injury-prone Trout?\nMike Trout might have been absent for most of the 2023 season, but his career records boast the story of a legendary hitter who has given more than his salt\u2019s worth to his current team. He has bagged 1624 hits and 940 RBIs with an 85.2 WAR and .301 BA across his 12-year-long baseball career. Unfortunately, Trout has become a victim of an injury streak, starting in 2022. He got his hands, left groin, back, and foot injured five times in the entire season; in 2023, he faced two hand injuries in two consecutive months.\nDespite his injury-prone history, the more logical option for the Dodgers would be to choose Trout over Ohtani; the team will not be able to afford them both at the same time. Trout comes with a cheaper price tag of $35.45 million compared to Ohtani\u2019s projected $48.63 million. The Dodgers could use his All-Star form in between injuries if he still keeps getting them in 2024. With Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers would be wasting a year letting him play at-bat, with a high chance of getting him further injured and missing more pitching time. Isn\u2019t it better to have a consistently wounded soldier than risk losing an overperforming one in a game of chances?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nWhy would Mike Trout switch to another Los Angeles team?\nTrout has been pretty persistent about sticking with the Los Angeles Angels from the very start. The team has been transparent about not stopping him should he choose to play for another team, but he does not want to do that. However, it seems that the Angels will have a hard time affording a player like Trout in the foreseeable future, as they have to win a good number of games to stay in the playoffs and keep a steady income of revenue throughout the seasons. Considering their 73-game win record this season, that seems like a pipe dream right now.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nTrout is 32 years old, which means that he has already hit the MLB average retirement age of 30. He still has a lot left to give to the diamond for approximately 6 more years. If the Dodgers have the chance to draft them, should they go with Ohtani, Trout, both, or neither?

Read our privacy notice Thanks for signing up to the\nFootball email {{ #verifyErrors }} {{ message }} {{ \/verifyErrors }} {{ ^verifyErrors }} Something went wrong. Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nIt was the sequel Newcastle United did not want, the second cruel comeback in as many Champions League games. For some 45 minutes, including half-time, they could savour the sight of a table that showed them in second, permitting them to imagine a date with Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the knockout stages. And then, little more than half an hour, they were ejected from Europe altogether.\nChristian Pulisic\u2019s equaliser threatened to condemn them to the Europa League. Samuel Chukwueze\u2019s winner instead meant that spot goes to AC Milan. The group of death went down to the dying minutes, but Newcastle have perished. They had savoured a return to Europe but there will be no continental trips for them in the spring of 2024.\nAnd, after Kylian Mbappe\u2019s controversial 98th-minute leveller in Paris, they can rue the loss of another lead. Once again, they may feel entitled to believe they should have won, but for different reasons. For much of the night, they were rampant and had Milan reeling. Yet, last season\u2019s Champions League semi-finalists hung in the game, scored twice and hit the woodwork twice more. For Newcastle, a third consecutive defeat may come with the sense that their injuries came at a cost. Theirs was another colossal effort, a far better performance than at Everton or Tottenham, but while Eddie Howe had the luxury of one attacking substitute \u2013 in Alexander Isak \u2013 three replacements combined for Milan\u2019s decider: first Luka Jovic found Noah Okafor and he picked out Chukwueze, who placed a shot past Martin Dubravka.\nIt was a sign of Newcastle\u2019s determination to win, not to settle for the point and the Europa League place, that they were short-staffed at the back because centre-back Fabian Schar had charged into the Milan box in open play. Likewise, in a frantic finale, they almost conceded a third: with Dubravka out of his goal, Theo Hernandez almost scored from the halfway line and Fikayo Tomori hit the post.\nAs they wonder what might have been, they can reflect on the turning point of Pulisic\u2019s strike, around the time Warren Zaire-Emery drew Paris Saint-Germain level against Borussia Dortmund. Newcastle failed to clear as the ball ricocheted around their box before Olivier Giroud found Pulisic to poke in a shot. The American had been a target for Newcastle last January; how they must now regret the fact he joined Milan in the summer.\nThen, with 11 minutes remaining, Rafael Leao sprinted clear and shot against the post. If this had threatened to be the derby of the depleted, Milan had Leao back for the first time in a month. Newcastle had Callum Wilson able to start, but their goal came from a less regular source, with a thunderbolt from Joelinton.\nJoelinton thumped home Newcastle\u2019s goal (Reuters)\nOne of the great success stories of Howe\u2019s reign, the misfit forward who was reinvented as a talismanic midfielder gave Newcastle a deserved lead. Joelinton\u2019s rasping, rising shot from the edge of the box flew past Mike Maignan. He had taken Miguel Almiron\u2019s pass and teed himself up. His initial non-celebration may have reflected his own surprise at the unerring accuracy of his strike.\nTheirs was the right response to the disappointment in Paris, a stirring effort. At this level, Newcastle do not possess a talent advantage but they can seek to outwork anyone. They rattled Milan by running at them. It took two astonishing interventions to stop them scoring both before and after Joelinton\u2019s strike.\nAt 0-0, Fikayo Tomori made a magnificent goal-line tackle to stop Miguel Almiron applying the finishing touch to Joelinton\u2019s low cross. It was a remarkable rescue act but pressure told when the Brazilian struck. Another almost joined him on the scoresheet at 1-1.\nNewcastle saw their European dreams slip away (Getty)\nMaignan tipped Bruno Guimaraes\u2019 20-yard shot onto the bar. As Nick Pope had denied Milan victory in San Siro with a string of saves, Stefano Pioli\u2019s team could testify to the difference brilliant goalkeeping can make. Now they benefited from it. Newcastle had 17 shots, eight on target, but Maignan was only beaten once. Milan had two shots on target but Dubravka conceded twice.\nThe loss of the injured Pope may have proved pivotal. But perhaps seven-time winners, and a side who reached the last four last year, displayed greater knowhow. Maybe they simply had greater strength in depth on a night when Kieran Trippier and Anthony Gordon were taken off because they seemed exhausted.\nNewcastle can nevertheless depart the competition with heads held high. One win and five points seem meagre tallies for their contribution to the competition. They have proof it can be unforgiving, reasons to return. Their first Champions League campaign for two decades will surely not be their last for another 20 years. But it is over, and they are left to wonder about what might have been.\n\nThis article, authored by Richard Jolly, was published by The Independent - Sports on 2023-12-13 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":425}

The Dodgers and Cubs are among the top teams expected to be aiming to sign the two-time AL MVP, and plenty of others should continue to compete through the end to land him.\nHere's the latest on Ohtani's free agency pursuits.\nMORE: Projecting Shohei Ohtani's contract in free agency\nShohei Ohtani news: Latest updates, rumors for MLB free agency\nOhtani agrees to 10-year, $700 million deal with Dodgers\nDate: Saturday, Dec. 9\nShohei Ohtani announced Saturday that he has agreed to a contract with the Dodgers. It's a colossal 10-year, $700 million deal with \"significant deferrals,\" so while Los Angeles won't pay him $70 million per year, the franchise will be paying him beyond those 10 seasons.\nWhile rumors connected Ohtani to the Blue Jays on Friday, it's the Dodgers who hand him a record-shattering contract and pair the two-time MVP with two former MVPs in Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman.\nOhtani not headed to Toronto, at his home in Southern California\nDate: Friday, Dec. 8\nSource: Bob Nightengale, USA Today; Ben Nicholson-Smith, Sportsnet\nOhtani had a change of plans, apparently. Hours after MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported that the two-way star was headed to Toronto for a meeting on Friday, USA Today's Nightengale and Sportsnet's Nicholson-Smith reported that Ohtani is at his home in Southern California.\nThe Blue Jays are still finalists to land Ohtani but his landing spot is not official yet.\nOhtani headed to Toronto on Friday\nDate: Friday, Dec. 8\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nOhtani might not have officially picked a team, but he is headed to Toronto, per MLB Network's Jon Morosi.

Hoornstra, Dodgers Nation\nThe Blue Jays have reportedly won the sweepstakes for Ohtani. According to Dodgers Nation's J.P. Hoornstra, Ohtani has selected the Blue Jays. The official details have not been reported, though the report indicated it will shatter Mike Trout's record 12-year, $426.5 million deal.\nHowever, Sportsnet's Ben Nicholson-Smith reported Ohtani has not yet made his decision, and there is not a timeline, though he noted Toronto is a finalist.\nDecision from Ohtani 'imminent'\nDate: Friday, Dec. 8\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nThe wait could soon be over. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reported Ohtani is expected to make his decision soon, reporting it could come as early as Friday.

Roberts said Ohtani is \"clearly\" the Dodgers' top priority, adding that the team is confident the two-time MVP will pitch again. Roberts wasn't able to offer a timeline for Ohtani's decision.\nCubs losing optimism in signing Ohtani\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Bob Nightengale, USA Today\nThe Cubs have been viewed as one of Ohtani's likeliest destinations for a while. It appears that might no longer be the case. USA Today's Bob Nightengale reported one high-ranking executive believes the Cubs' optimism of signing Ohtani \"has now significantly wanted.\" The report stated that leaves the Dodgers, Blue Jays, Angels and Giants as the remaining finalists.\nOhtani has 'positive feeling' about Blue Jays\nDate: Tuesday, Dec. 5\nSource: Jon Heyman, The New York Post\nThe Blue Jays reported met with Ohtani on Monday, but even before he went to talk with the team, Ohtani reportedly had a \"positive feeling about Toronto,\" along with other cities and teams, including the Dodgers.

And New York Post's Jon Heyman reported Ohtani has already received several deals that have topped $500 million, which could mean he winds up being the first $600 million player in MLB history. He added there are believed to be five teams in the running for Ohtani.\nOhtani decision coming this week\nDate: Dec. 3\nSource: Jon Morosi, MLB Network\nWith the winter meetings set to begin in Nashville, it seems a resolution is near for Ohtani. MLB Network's Jon Morosi reports the superstar is \"likely to decide on a team within the next week,\" according to a source.\nOhtani race starting to clear up\nDate: Dec. 1\nSource: Jeff Passan, ESPN\nTwo days before the start of the winter meetings, the picture on Ohtani is beginning to clear a bit more. ESPN's Jeff Passan reported the Rangers, Red Sox and Mets appear to be out of the running for Ohtani, while the Dodgers, Cubs, Blue Jays and Angels remain in the mix. The Giants are considered to be an unknown.\nIn addition to the teams, Passan also reported Ohtani is expecting a contract somewhere between $550 and $600 million, which would be the largest guaranteed contract in North American sports.\nBlue Jays could alter roster with Ohtani signing\nDate: Nov. 30\nSource: Jon Heyman, New York Post\nThe Blue Jays are one of the teams believed to still be among the strongest in the mix for Ohtani. The New York Post's Jon Heyman reported there could be some changes if Ohtani signs with the Blue Jays, however, reporting that some rivals believe Bo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. could hit the trade block if Toronto lands the star.\nTrading the two infielders might seem counterproductive to signing Ohtani in the first place. Those two would be the biggest supporting bats in the lineup around Ohtani. However, both are free agents after the 2025 season, and given the added payroll of signing Ohtani, it's possible Toronto would view keeping the other two phenoms as too pricey.\n\nThis article, authored by Edward Sutelan, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":426}
{"title":"New Alzheimer\u2019s drugs bring hope of slowing disease for UK patients","context":"## New Alzheimer\u2019s drugs bring hope of slowing disease for UK patients\n\nPeople in Britain could benefit from a key medical breakthrough next year. They may be given access to the first drugs ever developed to slow the impact of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe first of these medicines \u2013 lecanemab \u2013 was recently approved in the US and Japan, where treatments using it have already been launched. A second drug, donanemab, is expected to follow soon, and next year it is anticipated that the UK medical authorities will consider both of them for approval in Britain.\nThe prospect has raised hopes that, after years of effort, scientists may be closing in on ways to directly tackle the UK\u2019s dementia crisis. About a million people are living with the condition in this country, and this is expected to rise to about 1.7 million by 2040 \u2013 with potentially grim consequences. Last year dementia took the lives of 66,000 people in England and Wales, and it is now the leading cause of death in Britain, with Alzheimer\u2019s accounting for two-thirds of cases.\nUntil now doctors have only been able to prescribe medicines that help patients manage their symptoms, so the arrival of the first drugs that treat the actual cause of the condition has been welcomed \u2013 although experts have warned that their use should be treated with some caution.\nAfter decades of research, these are the first drugs to improve patients\u2019 lives directly. If nothing else, they suggest we\u2019re on the right road to tackling Alzheimer\u2019s\n\u201cThe new drugs slow down the development of Alzheimer\u2019s by six months to a year and are useful only for those in the early stages of the condition, so they are certainly not miracle medicines,\u201d said David Thomas, head of policy at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK.\n\u201cHowever, after decades of research, they are the first to improve patients\u2019 lives directly, and that is a justifiable cause for excitement. If nothing else, they suggest we are probably on the right road to tackling Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\nThis point was backed by neurologist Cath Mummery, of the Dementia Research Centre at University College London. \u201cIt has been a very long, hard road, but finally we have something positive to look at. That is very welcome.\u201d\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is triggered by the buildup of a protein called amyloid in the brain, although symptoms may not appear for decades after this accretion has started. Scientists have tried for more than 20 years to find ways to stop amyloid from forming these plaques, in the hope this would stop the progression of the disease.\nLecanemab, which is produced by Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai, and donanemab, produced by Eli Lilly of the US, are the first medicines to achieve this aim \u2013 though they only slow but do not ultimately halt the disease\u2019s progression.\nGraeme Armstrong with wife Trina, who has a rare form of Alzheimer\u2019s.\nBoth drugs are to be considered for approval in the UK next year. The Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will first decide if they are safe and effective, then the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) will rule on whether they offer value for money.\nBoth medicines are expensive \u2013 lecanemab costs about $25,000 (\u00a319,700) a year \u2013 and are given by regular intravenous infusions. \u201cThat is a challenge from a health-service point of view, because you need to find the space and time to put someone in an infusion suite to treat them,\u201d added Thomas.\nHowever, the main problem facing doctors is the difficulty involved in pinpointing dementia not just in its early stages but even in its later phases. Most cases are first presented to GPs, who will then refer patients to memory clinics for a dementia test. However there are long waiting times \u2013 up to two years on average \u2013 for appointments at these centres.\nIn addition, diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia is usually based on pen-and-paper tests, followed by lumbar punctures and brain scans before a final diagnosis.\nAbout 65% of cases are confirmed this way. The remaining third of dementia cases are never diagnosed. Yet patients can only expect to receive treatments \u2013 including the new drugs \u2013 if their condition is identified.\nEleanor Mackenzie-Smith\u2019s father, Mike, has young-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. His first symptoms were spotted 17 years ago, when Eleanor was 11. \u201cHowever, it took over 10 years from the start of his symptoms and four separate tests between 2009 and 2017 to get my dad\u2019s final diagnosis, when he was 65. It was distressing not knowing what was happening. Too many families, like mine, have had to watch as dementia takes hold of our loved ones while we are left without a diagnosis and the support and access to treatments.\u201d\nIt took 10 years for Mike Mackenzie-Smith to get a diagnosis of young-onset Alzheimer\u2019s.\nAnother grim illustration of the problem facing patients is provided by Graeme Armstrong. His wife, Trina, began having trouble recognising faces and reading telephone numbers in 2006 and was told, after a CT scan three years later, that she had probably had a stroke \u2013 although her symptoms did not suggest such a diagnosis. It took another three years before she was diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy, a rare variant of Alzheimer\u2019s disease that affects the way the brain interprets information from the eyes.\n\u201cHad we had an accurate diagnosis four years earlier, Trina could have been placed on the correct medication, which may have been more effective and helped her day to day,\u201d Armstrong said.\nOne solution sought by doctors involves the creation of blood tests which could pinpoint the disease quickly and effectively. \u201cThese are under research, but we are several years away from having them in widespread use,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cMeanwhile, we have got to get the NHS to a state where it is much more focused and better organised in getting better and earlier dementia diagnoses. That will be crucial in our battle against the condition.\u201d\nMummery agreed: \u201cBy the time you have dementia, you will have had Alzheimer\u2019s disease developing in your brain for at least 20 years. Dementia is the latest stage; we need to pick up signals much earlier. So we need to be thinking about how to diagnose people at the very earliest stages of disease, when they may only have very, very subtle symptoms.\nWe are now exploring ways of helping drugs get into the brain much more efficiently, and that could have a major impact Cath Mummery\n\u201cOur current service isn\u2019t good for doing that, and we need to develop brain health clinics where we can pinpoint the disease much earlier, then help to build resilience against dementia in a patient when it is only in a very early stage.\u201d\nIn the long term, scientists also point to a number of recent developments which have raised hopes that it may be possible to tackle dementia more directly and effectively. One major challenge they have faced is the problem of getting drugs to pass through the blood-brain barrier, which controls the movement of ions and molecules from our bodies to our brains. That makes it difficult to get drugs into the central nervous system to tackle problems such as amyloid plaques.\n\u201cHowever, researchers are developing active transport methods for getting drugs across the blood-brain barrier,\u201d said Mummery. \u201cFor example, we are now exploring ways of helping drugs get into the brain much more efficiently, and that could have a major impact.\u201d\nSuch developments will take years to realise, scientists caution, and a great deal needs to be done in the short term to deal with dementia.\n\u201cIt is clear we have taken a step in the right direction but there is much more to do before we can have successfully dealt with these processes that are happening to our brains,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cIt is a challenge, and a very important one.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Robin McKie, Science Editor, was published by The Guardian on 2023-12-17 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":427}
{"title":"The 35 best couch co-op games for Nintendo Switch","context":"## The 35 best couch co-op games for Nintendo Switch\n\nMany games are huge. Others are endless. Some are so exciting that they swallow our news feeds whole. That\u2019s where Polygon\u2019s What to Play comes in: We curate the best, most innovative, and most intriguing games on every platform, so you can spend less time searching, and more time playing.\nThere\u2019s a lot to love about the Nintendo Switch, not least of which is the abundance of titles with local multiplayer features, making it a great console for game night with friends or a casual play session with a roommate. We\u2019ve collected some of our favorite titles that allow for good old-fashioned local play.\nIt\u2019s also my preferred play style, as the last few years have given me more excuses to stay in and try new games. Local multiplayer makes ass-kicking games much more approachable, thanks to friends respawning my character. I also love building something together in real time, like a farm in Stardew Valley, or causing communal chaos like with Untitled Goose Game\u2019s treacherous honking. Sure, couch co-op can also mean getting revived just to get ragdolled across spikes in Spelunky 2. But it sure beats dying alone.\nAnd if you\u2019re looking for more platform-agnostic couch co-op recommendations, here are our favorite local multiplayer games, games to play with a Valentine\u2019s Day beau, and a Dear Polygon column about couch co-op. Our last update added Escape Academy.\nFor two players\nThis modern-classic farming sim game takes its cues from the Harvest Moon series, and running a farm with your friends only adds to the fun. You can work together to plant and harvest crops or spend your days doing different activities, like fishing or mining. Local co-op is available for two players \u2014 just don\u2019t forget to build an extra cabin on your farm. (Up to four can play with online multiplayer.)\nThis Switch remaster includes both Portal and Portal 2, seminal games well worth the revisit. You\u2019ll explore and solve puzzles by using a portal gun; experimenting within the game\u2019s physics is even more fun with a friend in tow. (Plus, when playing local co-op, the number of portals that can be placed is doubled.)\nCongrats, you are the new CEO of a large corporation, and your wisdom is required to help employees stay on task. Good Job! has a lot in common with Untitled Goose Game. In this isometric game, you\u2019ll be given a list of tasks \u2014 like bringing a projector into the conference room. But no one said you couldn\u2019t do it by launching it like a projectile through the window.\nThis Wii U game\u2019s Switch port is full of charm. Play together in local co-op as Captain Toad and Toadette, and explore and solve your way through a series of bite-size puzzles. Each self-contained course has little nooks and crannies to pop in and out of, and Koopas to navigate around.\nIt\u2019s a lovely morning in the village and you are a horrible goose! Cause mayhem and honk to your heart\u2019s content in this charming game. With local co-op you and one friend can each be horrible geese, using teamwork to terrorize the townspeople. Honk honk HONK!!\nIn this melancholy game, you play as Stella the ferrymaster, who guides spirits into the afterlife. Meet wonderful characters and help them find closure. Spiritfarer combines exploration on the seas with management sim elements, as you build housing, kitchens, and more, and learn to farm, cook, and craft. Player two is Stella\u2019s cat Daffodil, who can do most management sim tasks \u2014 she just can\u2019t talk to characters, and thus, can\u2019t trigger quests.\nScrew playing as the plumber in the red hat \u2014 it\u2019s time to be his taller counterpart. In Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, you can play local co-op with player two as Gooigi (a spooky goo Luigi) after finishing the intro walkthrough and getting E. Gadd\u2019s briefcase. Platform your way through the haunted hotel to save your friends Mario, Peach, and numerous Toads.\nThis modern-day, punishingly difficult platformer has the beautiful look of vintage animation. The art direction and soundtrack are wholly unique, making the game a joyride from start to finish, despite the challenge. Mugman, Cuphead\u2019s sibling, can join on a local co-op journey.\nPlay as a Yarny (a living ball of yarn that looks like a small sprite) and solve puzzles with a friend by using your spare yarn to pull, yank, and swing. It requires quite a bit of teamwork. Where other local co-op games might allow players to wander and do their own thing, this game is all about solving puzzles using each other\u2019s momentum.\nKirby games tend to be perfectly chill and incredibly adorable, and this one is no exception. In Forgotten Land you and another player run, float, and fight through 3D levels. In addition to Kirby\u2019s classic inhale powers, Forgotten Land also gifted us \u201cmouthful mode,\u201d which lets Kirby stretch like a glove over enormous objects like cars and huge lightbulbs. (By the way, Kirby Star Allies is also fun with local co-op.)\nPlay as characters named \u201cNobody\u201d as you work together to attempt to cure the world of a poisonous blight, and figure out why you have no memory of your past life. But there\u2019s another twist: Instead of a classic perk tree, your characters will unlock various forms \u2014 like a turtle, ghost, knight, or ninja \u2014 each with its own set of moves. What\u2019s more, the forms can synergize with one another, making for some incredibly absurd skill combos.\nCat Quest 2\nThis criminally underrated action game puts you in the shoes of a cat fighting their way through the pun-filled land of Felingard. And player two gets to be a dog! Playing is a simple grind in this approachable and silly RPG. Fight your way through dungeons, meet necromancer cats, and try on lots of outfits.\nPlay as an automaton that needs a gem substance to survive, and fight against the clock to keep your friends from becoming \u201cunsighted\u201d and turning into shells of their former selves. This Metroidvania has an incredible map with three interwoven floors of levels, and tons of Zelda-like puzzles. A couch co-op buddy makes these challenges much more surmountable.\nThis pixel art Metroidvania has the feel of a great NES game, with its retro aesthetic and excellent platforming and battling. The definitive edition (which includes the original Shovel of Hope campaign), available on Nintendo Switch, supports local co-op for two players.\nThe Lego games are always a great laugh, and they have reliable couch co-op modes (see also: Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2). They\u2019re accessible, family-friendly, and give a silly spin to some of the most recognizable films of our time. The Skywalker Saga is no different, with Lego versions of a whopping nine movies from the behemoth franchise and 200-plus minifigs to unlock.\nA silly collaboration between Nintendo and Ubisoft became one of the sleeper hits of its release year. This squad tactics game pairs Mario and friends with their own doppelganger Rabbids against a veritable sea of evil Rabbids. While local co-op is limited to five specific challenges \u2014 so we wouldn\u2019t recommend buying it specifically for co-op play alone \u2014 these levels are especially fun. Working together changes the tactical dynamics.\nCrypt of the Necrodancer is the perfect combination of dungeon crawler and rhythm game \u2014 with some sweet tunes, to enliven the whole experience. But dancing through the game\u2019s levels is even more fun with a friend, even if having someone else there doesn\u2019t necessarily make it easier. You both still have to stay on beat!\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted an escape room experience but in a video game, Escape Academy absolutely scratches that itch. Up to two couch co-op players can go to this school for puzzle enthusiasts. Players find solutions and crack codes to avoid legitimately perilous fates \u2014 like a tower flooding with water as you climb. Hints (and red herrings) are everywhere. Are you smart enough to escape each room?\nFor two or more players\nSuper Mario Bros. has always been one of Nintendo\u2019s most beloved franchises, and Wonder is another banger. Super Mario Bros. Wonder brings together so many delightful ideas: platforming shenanigans, silly power-ups, and lots of map secrets. The best part? Four people can play local multiplayer, picking from so many classic characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Toad, Toadette, and more.\nI\u2019ve donated hours and hours of my life to this deceptively simple roguelike bullet-hell \u2014 min-maxing various buffs in order to avoid waves of mob attacks. But multiplayer changes everything. Having more reinforcements to fight waves of attacks means each player can try out unique combinations of weapons and buffs. Just make sure you and your teammates stay in the same screen; there isn\u2019t split screen.\nThough packing up and moving is a pain in the neck in real life, Moving Out 2 turns the experience into a goofy, whimsical group experience. Play as a member of the F.A.R.T. moving crew (yes, you read that correctly) attempting to move furniture, and other items, around some highly inconvenient spaces.\nNow more than a decade old, Diablo 3 is still a great local multiplayer choice, especially on the Switch. The action RPG, which felt bombastic when it first came out, has become a very comforting grind game that I get to share with friends. (Especially as Diablo 4 hasn\u2019t made its way to Nintendo Switch.)\nThis one is not for the faint of heart. Work with a friend to excavate cave levels, avoid the dangers within, and ration supplies. In local co-op, if one of you dies, you can bring them back to life by finding a coffin. Ragdoll physics \u2014 not to mention turkey riding \u2014 add challenge and humor to one of the best platformer roguelikes.\nThis edition of Rayman Legends has all of the platforming and hijinks that the series is known for. Play through delightful levels and time trials, and collect to your heart\u2019s content. Having multiple players is particularly helpful for respawning, as the game ramps up in difficulty in its later levels.\nSure, racing games and soccer games are fun on their own \u2014 but mashing the two together results in something bizarre and unforgettable. Rocket League asks what other games don\u2019t dare to: What if you played soccer? And what if you did that with rocket-powered vehicles?\nTowerfall Ascension is the gold standard for 2D arena games. Players are archers and must fight each other with well-placed arrows, or by stomping from above. Movement is a dream with dodging and dashing in the air, lending each character a spry and agile feel. Different multiplayer variants, like starting with just one arrow and having to scavenge for others, keep rounds feeling fresh.\nThis bestseller is a no-brainer for anyone looking to spend time with friends in a sandbox world. Mine, build, dig, fish, plant crops, and protect yourself from the monsters that come out at night \u2014 and most of all, survive.\nThis definitive remaster bundles Overcooked and Overcooked 2 (both excellent games) into one delicious package. Prepare orders for hungry customers while facing ridiculous odds \u2014 like cooking in a hot air balloon with cooktops that sometimes catch on fire, or while crossing a busy street.\nIf you\u2019re searching for that classic Super Mario feeling in a modern 3D world, look no further. (Or if you\u2019ve always wanted to play as Mario in a cat suit.) Play as Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Toad \u2014 each of them has a slightly different perk. Luigi can get a bit more air in his jump, while Toad is a bit faster.\nThe Mario Party series reigns supreme as a family-friendly, chill party time. In this board game-style title, players pick their favorite Nintendo character and then roll the dice to land on a spot on the board. Players compete in minigames, including a baseball-bat-swinging rhythm game, rowboat race, snow catching, and so many more.\nWii Sports\u2019 legacy will never be forgotten (nor will its banging soundtrack). Nintendo Switch Sports gracefully takes up the mantle of its predecessor, along with many of the same classic sports, like bowling, golf, and tennis. It also adds some new ones to the mix, like volleyball and chambara (a great complement to Wii Sports\u2019 boxing). Just make sure you have enough space around you so you don\u2019t accidentally hit your television.\nNo multiplayer Nintendo Switch list would be complete without mentioning the most recent edition of 20-year series Mario Kart. Though the game came out in 2017, it still reigns supreme, as far as kart racing goes \u2014 and it still gets new courses, like the recent addition of Mario Kart 7\u2019s Rainbow Road.\nScramble with your friends to operate a spaceship hurtling through outer space. Each of you can only pilot one of the ship\u2019s eight total control panels at any given time. We hope you like your partners, because you\u2019ll be shouting directions and trying not to lose it as you work together.\nThe premise is simple: Each of you is a piece of paper, and you can cut shapes out of one another in order to accomplish tasks. Some of these challenges involve working together to create a specific shape. Others require teamwork to shoot a ball into a hoop or fill up a basin with water. Bring your most levelheaded (or, alternatively, chaotic) friends.\nAnother Switch take on a stone-cold classic, Nintendo\u2019s fight-to-the-death brawler is stocked with all of your favorite characters. Play with up to seven other people and survive to be the last one standing.\nTMNT: Shredder\u2019s Revenge is a return to the halcyon days for any TMNT fan, and a truly excellent beat-\u2019em-up brawler. Players can choose between the four Turtles \u2014 Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael \u2014 along with April O\u2019Neil, Master Splinter, or Casey Jones.\n\nThis article, authored by Nicole Clark, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-20 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":428}
{"title":"Yankees Gear Up for 2024 Season After Horrendous Year, But Could Letting This Star Go Spell Another Big Mistake?","context":"## Yankees Gear Up for 2024 Season After Horrendous Year, But Could Letting This Star Go Spell Another Big Mistake?\n\nThe baseball season for the New York teams didn\u2019t turn out to be their most successful one. Both the New York Mets and the New York Yankees failed to make it to the playoffs and came under scrutiny as the highest spenders in the league. But the level of accounting has come higher for the 27-time winners because of the highest expectations. The management has comprehended the situation and is actively seeking to make changes for the 2024 season. Be it trimming the squad and releasing a few players, including superstar Gleyber Torres, they look to bring about changes. But given that they are already short on options, it brings up the question: Is the move justified?\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nAlthough it was a decent season for the second baseman, the lack of consistency brought Torres under scrutiny for changes for the upcoming season. Also, given he is currently in arbitration with the Yankees, it adds to his trade chances. The reason is that the team won\u2019t want to lose the opportunity to cash in some money from his trade. The decision appears promising as the team seeks a shift, but the data tells a different story. Gleyber Torres\u2019s Exit Becomes the Talk of the Town as the Yankees Look for a Rebuild The New York Yankees have been in the news since the league stage ended. First, because of the possibility of a third-party audit, which was later shunted out. Later, the comments from Aaron Judge brought a lot of attention to the workings of the team, conflicts, and divisions between the core four. Now it\u2019s the assumptions of changes with the idea of cutting down the $300 million budget for the next season. One name that is making the rounds for an exit is Gleyber Torres. Notably, the 26-year-old avoided arbitration ahead of the 2023 season and signed a $9.95 million contract. It was a brilliant move, given the requirements of the Bronx Bombers. Torres fulfilled it for most of the season to finish it on a high, scoring 90 runs, 25 home runs, and 68 RBIs at an average of 0.273 and an OPS of 0.800. Torres also finished at the top of the batting charts for the team, alongside captain Aaron Judge, clinching the most hits and recording an OBP of 0.347. The infielder also finished second in the fielding department behind the team\u2019s Gold Glove prospect, Anthony Volpe. The seasoned player made 80 double plays, with 563 chances created at a fielding percentage of 0.975. The performance from Gleyber has been crucial in a season filled with injuries on both fronts. But the Yankees are not favoring his services for the upcoming season. There are two reasons behind the interest of the Miami Marlins and the push for lower spending. As mlbtraderumors.com suggests, Torres is expected to earn $15.3 million next year; his trade could save the Yankees some money. The Marlins have been interested in him for a long time, and the Pinstripes can have a good deal for the outfielder. Considering the advantages, this appears promising. However, is it a worthwhile endeavor? Should the New York Yankees Trade Gleyber Torres Ahead of the New Season? Nothing has worked well for the New York Yankees this season. They had their worst finish in seven years, even after having all the resources. The Yankees are seeking a shift in their strategy, which has exceeded their initial expectations. This shift encompasses alterations in both offensive and defensive personnel, and surprisingly, it involves Gleyber Torres. Although it is a reboot button from Brian Cashman for a better 2024, should the Yankees refraining from including Torres? The answer is simple: they should indeed because of his worth as a player. It may sound huge as they expect Torres to earn $15 million, but it is not a big ask for the multibillion-dollar Yankees. The 2009 champions can easily fulfill this request without constraining their spending.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nPlus, Torres is the sole option for the Yankees at second base. With limited options available in the market, the team is in the circumstances to spend more. And if the Yankees are for other infielders, they may have to reshuffle to make their place in the squad. It will include the shift of Oswaldo Peraza from third baseman to second. However, Peraza could not do well this season, even after all the positives. His involvement in unique positions could be a risk for the team.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nMoreover, free agents Whit Merrifield and Adam Frazier have not done well. Given that the Yankees finished second last in total hits and had over 1400 strikeouts, losing a player with the best record in both parameters will not be ideal. Notably, Torres has a 14.6% strikeout rate, with only a handful of players recording a lower rate. He also covered a lot of bases this season to finish second to Judge. All these factors make him a player that the Yankees should keep as they look for a change in 2024.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nnot in the best shape, losing Torres could haunt the Yankees further. It will be interesting to see how the most successful team approaches this. Will they be able to find genuine replacements on the market? Only time will tell. His trading is not worth it for the Yankees, which will further reduce the options in the outfield. With rookies and the farm not compensating for the demand, it would be a big ask for them to fulfill.

{"title":"Simply Homes nabs $22M, leverages AI to tackle affordable housing crisis","context":"## Simply Homes nabs $22M, leverages AI to tackle affordable housing crisis\n\nThe United States has long had an affordable housing crisis, but it\u2019s been exacerbated as of late by a surge in mortgage interest rates and low inventory.\nThe problem is especially acute for lower-income families.\nOne Portland, Maine-based startup is out to help address the problem by buying single-family homes in blighted neighborhoods, renovating them and then renting them out to very low-income families, the elderly and the disabled (or Section-8 voucher holders). That startup, Simply Homes, has recently secured $22 million in funding to further its efforts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping to solve the affordability crisis for people who struggle with housing stability the most,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Brian Bagdasarian. \u201cWhile there are groups that have attempted to tackle programmatic buying of homes in the past \u2014 to varying degrees of success \u2014 the reality is no one is operating in our market, providing well-maintained affordable homes to the people most in need.\u201d\nIndeed, most iBuyers are focused on buying, renovating and either selling or renting homes in middle to upper class neighborhoods. And most home builders are \u201cout of touch and building homes that no one who needs affordable housing could ever afford,\u201d Bagdasarian told TechCrunch in an interview.\nThe opportunity to help people overcome poverty and improve their chances for social and economic mobility was what attracted Bagdasarian and co-founder and CFO Robert Kavanagh to build Simply Homes\u2019 model.\n\u201cChildren that are able to move into lower-poverty neighborhoods can see a 31% increase in lifetime earnings,\u201d Bagdasarian said.\nAnd the pair are firm believers that you can still make money and do good at the same time.\nFounded in 2020, Simply Homes spent its first couple of years developing its platform and associated models before buying its first home in January of this year. By the end of this month, the startup is expected to have 108 units, or homes, in its portfolio. Since its first-quarter launch, it\u2019s seen its revenue grow by more than 50% quarter over quarter.\nOver 80% of Simply Homes\u2019 tenant base are single parents who would need to work an estimated 150 hours a week to afford market-rate rent on a home, notes Bagdasarian. Utilizing HUD\u2019s HCV program through Simply Homes, these families are paying no more than 30% of their income for rent, claims Bagdasarian.\nCurrently, Simply Homes operates in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cleveland, Ohio. Its goal is to expand into Baltimore, Maryland and parts of the Midwest, including additional markets throughout Ohio and in St. Louis, Missouri, among other cities. The company looks for stable markets that aren\u2019t susceptible to wild fluctuations in the housing industry.\nSimply Homes operates in an operating company\/property company structure, with the operational company using its technology platform and operational teams to source, acquire, renovate and manage the properties. The property management company holds them long term.\nMany proptech companies have struggled, or outright shut down, this year, in large part due to the sky-high interest rates. But Simply Homes, according to Bagdasarian, factored in the possibility of high interest rates very early on in its model so it has been less affected by the macro environment.\n\u201cEverything is underwritten to a worst-case scenario. A lot of first generation ibuyers never underwrote interest rate risk. But we started with that,\u201d Bagdasarian said. \u201cWe made sure our large return rates were inclusive of high interest rates that still allowed us to operate profitably. The other piece of that is we have highly stable income \u2014 because the way that Housing Choice Voucher works is that the tenant pays 30% of their adjusted monthly income. The voucher covers the balance. So it\u2019s highly predictable income.\u201d\nInitially, the company set out to solve the automated underwriting part of the process for third parties, and then for itself by leveraging Bagdasarian\u2019s AI background and Kavanagh\u2019s real estate experience. Bagdasarian has two decades of experience in human process automation and machine learning, and previously was with HubSpot, having joined as part of the founding team of Motion. Kavanagh previously led the acquisition of Ireland\u2019s largest social housing portfolio, and spent 10 years as an investment banker at Jefferies and Cantor Fitzgerald in New York and London, specializing in infrastructure and ESG assets.\n\u201cWe know what we can rent the homes for because the housing authority (or HUD) gives us that information. This means we can underwrite \u2014 using that data and machine learning \u2014 very accurately, very effectively and very rapidly,\u201d Bagdasarian said. \u201cThis eliminates a lot of the friction that has kept other institutions out of the space and gives us this sort of first-mover advantage.\u201d\nSimply Homes collects the rent on its properties, which helps cover the cost of managing the properties. It takes a transaction fee, and a 3% fee on an ongoing basis to manage the portfolio.\nBesides expanding into new markets, the company plans to use its new capital in part toward developing a series of AI-powered virtual analysts that \u201crapidly\u201d interpret massive amounts of data that Simply Homes aggregates and leverages to make its acquisitions.\nGutter Capital and Watchung Capital co-led the company\u2019s recent $22 million funding round, which included participation from Village Global, Ambush Capital, RavenOne Ventures, Neil Parikh, Gabe Flateman, Luke Sherwin and others.\nJames Gettinger, managing partner at Gutter Capital, told TechCrunch that he believes Simply Homes is doing something \u201cthat very sorely needs to be done.\u201d\n\u201cBy rejuvenating the aging housing stock, they\u2019re able to make homes available to people who are affected by the affordability crisis the most,\u201d he said. \u201cOne facet of the housing shortage that I think doesn\u2019t get enough attention, frankly, is the fact that starter homes are no longer built. The average size of new construction homes has gone from something like 1,400 square feet 50 years ago to 2,200 square feet today. The downstream consequence of that is\u2026basically, none of the new homes that are coming on market are affordable to the majority of Americans..\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone who\u2019s addressing affordability for the bottom end of the market like this,\u201d he added.\n\nThis article, authored by Mary Ann Azevedo, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-07 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":430}
{"title":"Amazon\u2019s latest Echo Frames are more style than substance","context":"## Amazon\u2019s latest Echo Frames are more style than substance\n\nThe purpose of the Amazon Echo Frames is obvious: to provide quick access to Alexa no matter where you are because it\u2019s on your face. But generally speaking, that\u2019s not why anyone wants smart glasses, let alone a pair that costs $389.99 like the Carrera Cruiser model I\u2019ve been wearing for the past week.\nFor better or worse, most people\u2019s vision of smart glasses is informed by Tony Stark, James Bond, and other iconic sci-fi and spy movie characters: sleek, discreet devices that have some sort of hidden mixed reality display or the ability to capture the world around you. The original Google Glass cemented that image, while successors like the Snap Spectacles and the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have leaned heavily into content creation. But the Echo Frames hasn\u2019t really ever been quite that ambitious. Like the Bose Frames, Amazon\u2019s approach to smart glasses has primarily been as a pair of open-ear headphones that you can take calls on, listen to music with, and ask the occasional Alexa query. There\u2019s no camera, no screen, and nothing to clue anyone in that you\u2019re not just wearing ordinary glasses.\n6 Verge Score Amazon Echo Frames Carrera Cruiser $ 314.99 The Good More stylish and more options\nImproved battery life and audio\nCan use with multiple devices The Bad Bass still isn\u2019t great and audio leaks\nDoes less or sounds not as good as others in this category\nAlexa still isn\u2019t the best assistant when you\u2019re on the go\nPricey for the category $315 at Amazon How we rate and review products\nAmazon isn\u2019t straying too far from that formula with these third-gen Echo Frames. The big thing now is that they\u2019re lighter, the battery lasts longer, the bass is more bassy, and they look a lot more stylish than previous iterations. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough to turn the Echo Frames into a must-have gadget \u2014 but it\u2019s a half-step in the right direction.\nStrike a pose\nIt\u2019s a big deal that Amazon\u2019s latest Echo Frames look nicer than before. Style is one of the most underrated criteria for smart glasses, and put simply, you\u2019re just not going to wear something that makes you look like a dweeb. Everyone\u2019s face and vision is different, and a successful pair of smart glasses is going to account for that by offering a wide range of styles, colors, and fits.\nIt\u2019s a vibe.\nWith the third-gen Echo Frames, you can choose between clear, prescription, blue light filtering, and sunglass lenses. They also come in multiple shapes, including round, cat eye, square, rectangle, and \u201cmodern\u201d rectangle. These start at $269.99 for the most basic clear lenses, $299.99 for blue light filtering lenses, and $329.99 for sunglasses.\nThese are all subtler options, but if you like a flashier style, Amazon is also continuing its partnership with Carrera. That extra pizzazz comes with a heftier price tag. The Cruiser (the one I have) and Sprinter model will both set you back $389.99. The latter is more of a boxy, Wayfarer-esque frame and gives you the option of sunglass or blue light filtering lenses.\nI have a low nose bridge, so I had to keep pushing these up after a few seconds.\nBecause the Cruiser only comes with sunglass lenses, I wore these during my commute and on outdoor walks. They are a vibe. I\u2019ve been described as channeling Yeezy, a Kardashian reject, a card-carrying member of the Jersey Shore mafia, and a time traveler from the \u201980s. I most definitely have turned heads while on the street. I had fun wearing these, and most folks could pull this off so long as they put a little swagger in their step \u2014 but personally, this isn\u2019t the style I\u2019d pick for my day-to-day sunnies, mostly because they didn\u2019t fit my face well. While these are made of a lightweight acetate weighing 46.3g, I have a low nose bridge, and these were slipping down my face every five seconds. The other thing I didn\u2019t love about the Cruiser glasses was the build quality. While they look high fashion, they feel plasticky in my hands and not befitting of their nearly $400 price tag.\nForget the bass\nAs I said, these are less smart glasses than they are a pair of open-ear headphones. On that front, the Echo Frames are alright for the category but are nothing mind-blowing.\nBass is purportedly three times better on the new Echo Frames, but they\u2019re still not going to bring the thump of even standard AirPods. I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of Stray Kids lately, and Felix\u2019s TikTok-breaking rumbly baritone is absolutely lost on these. In God\u2019s Menu, the song\u2019s famous \u201ccookin\u2019 like a chef I\u2019m a 5-star Michelin\u201d line is reduced to zero-star Michelin. On a loud train, I couldn\u2019t even hear it despite turning the volume up to the max.\nThis isn\u2019t a problem limited to the Echo Frames \u2014 it\u2019s a common problem with any open-ear audio headphones. That said, the same song on the Meta smart glasses sounded a bit richer. These were a lot better for podcasts or less bass-heavy songs, but you still can\u2019t get away from the feeling like you\u2019re listening to something from a few feet away instead of right next to your ear.\nI don\u2019t love the charging stand, but battery life has been improved.\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a fair amount of audio leakage. No one asked me to turn things down while I was commuting. Trains and city noises are loud. But at the same volume in the office, all of my co-workers could hear that I was listening to something. They might not have been able to discern the song, but it was loud enough to be distracting.\nAs for call quality, these were good enough. I called a friend during an hour-long walk, and she was able to hear me despite beeping trucks and wind. In her words, I sounded \u201cecho-y,\u201d and she could hear a lot of the ambient noise around me, but at no point was she unable to hear me. I do like that you can pair the glasses to multiple devices and have them switch between the two \u2014 that\u2019s something the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses weren\u2019t really capable of. However, this is only useful if you\u2019re getting clear glasses, as you shouldn\u2019t be wearing sunglasses indoors while on your laptop.\nThe right side has two action buttons. The volume rocker is on the left side. You can also see some of the directional speakers and mics.\nThe controls are at least easy to navigate. On the left arm, you\u2019ve got a self-explanatory volume rocker. (Though, I found myself reaching for the volume rocker on my phone far more often. Habits are hard to break, especially if you often have your phone in hand anyway.) On the right side, there are two action buttons that you can use to take or decline calls, put the device into pairing mode, or mute Alexa. If you press the back action button twice, you can launch a personalized playlist on the music streaming service of your choice. For me, I\u2019d think that\u2019d be a list full of K-pop and sad indie artists like Phoebe Bridgers and Mitski. Instead, the glasses played a list full of artists I didn\u2019t know and songs that I would never listen to.\nLike I said, these are more headphones than smart glasses.\nAlexa on your face\nThe main thing that\u2019s supposed to set the Echo Frames apart is the fact that they have Alexa built in. My problem here is that Alexa has never been and still isn\u2019t a particularly good voice assistant when you\u2019re on the go. It\u2019s fine at answering odd queries, setting timers, and telling you the weather \u2014 but it\u2019s much better at controlling your smart home than replacing Siri or Assistant.\nIt\u2019s not that you can\u2019t do things. You can now use this to make non-Alexa calls and, if you have an Android phone, reply to text messages. Directions are also possible, but it\u2019s clunky. Alexa told me I\u2019d get a notification on my phone to start... but that meant tweaking my notification settings to a less preferred option. When I did get it working, it suggested I go to Bowling Green in Kentucky instead of the Manhattan train station five minutes away. Most things are still just easier (and faster) on my phone. As a result, I didn\u2019t have a lot of reasons to actually use Alexa on these glasses. That was only exacerbated by the fact that I had a pair of sunglasses instead of regular glasses.\nIt relies on your phone for a connection, and that\u2019s a pro and a con. So long as you have a stable Bluetooth connection and your phone has signal, you can use Alexa reliably while on the go. On the flip side, you don\u2019t have much offline usability on that front. Plus, you need to make sure the Alexa app is always open and running in the background.\nIt says to just ask Alexa, but I didn\u2019t find much to ask beyond the weather and timers.\nEven so, it\u2019s just weird to say \u201cAlexa\u201d in public. (You can change the wake word to Echo if that feels better, but for me, it did not.) This is an issue I have with nearly every pair of smart glasses with some kind of voice assistant. Earbuds are a visual and cultural signal that we all implicitly understand. If I\u2019m talking to midair with AirPods in, you can be confident I\u2019m on a call. Me talking to myself with no phone or AirPods in sight got me some odd looks from strangers \u2014 and confused looks from some of my friends.\nIn terms of notifications, I like that you have some control over when you get notified. There\u2019s a VIP Filter you can curate so that only select apps and contacts will notify you. The glasses will play a sound whenever you get a notification, and then you can pull your phone out to check. It won\u2019t read your texts, but I appreciate that. I don\u2019t love it when Siri takes 10 years to read out the URL to a funny link my friends send me, for instance. It does mean you have to be ruthless when setting up your VIP list, however.\nYou can set a VIP Filter to curate your notifications, but it\u2019s best to be ruthless here since you only hear a ping.\nFor testing purposes, I did try issuing a few Alexa commands while I had these at home. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn\u2019t trip up any of my Echo speakers. There is a feature where you can ask any Echo speaker you have to locate your Frames. That\u2019s nice, but at the same time, I doubt it\u2019s something most people will frequently use. As a lifelong glasses wearer, mine are always either in a case or on my nightstand because. I have a specific drawer for sunglasses. Plus, this feature relies on your glasses having a decent charge.\nSpeaking of charge, these held up well over the past week. My commute is around 60\u201380 minutes, depending how much the MTA wants to test me. I\u2019ve gotten about five hours of media playback and calls thus far and have about 30 percent battery left. Meanwhile, a roughly 50-minute call drained the battery about 20 percent. Charging from zero to 100 percent takes about 2.5 hours, though I\u2019m not a big fan of the charging stand\u2019s design. It took me a hot second to figure out that you\u2019re supposed to place them on the stand vertically so that the lenses are pointed straight up at the ceiling. The way the stand is designed, I\u2019d expected you\u2019d plop them in horizontally. I missed the charging case of Meta\u2019s smart glasses, which killed two birds with one stone and was a much more elegant charging solution overall.\nPay more for less\nIf you\u2019re a heavy Alexa user, I can see paying the $270 for the base model and maybe using FSA or HSA funds if you need prescription lenses. But while I like the look of the Carrera Cruiser model, this is not nearly $400 worth of tech and style, especially not when the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses start at $299 \u2014 a mere $30 more than the cheapest Echo Frames. Those get you better build quality, a surprisingly good hands-free camera for photos and video, the ability to livestream to Instagram, better audio quality, and a much better mic. Those get you the option of transition lenses, too, though the third-gen Echo Frames are at least on a similar playing field when it comes to style. Likewise, the Bose Frames Tempo and Soprano have a retail price of $249 \u2014 and can be found on sale for around $200. Those have similar battery life and better sound quality.\nAudio definitely leaks on these in quieter spaces.\nThese make some small moves in the right direction. Again, improving the range of available styles was a much-needed change. It\u2019s good to beef up the audio, but it wasn\u2019t enough of a change to make these stand above the competition or a compelling alternative to wireless earbuds. But perhaps most crucially, I wasn\u2019t convinced to use Alexa more than I otherwise would have. As it stands, I think Amazon\u2019s getting there with form. It\u2019s just not quite there with function.\n\nThis article, authored by Victoria Song, was published by The Verge on 2023-12-07 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":431}

Currently, two of them, on a rotating basis, act as the semifinal games for the CFP.\nHowever, that will expand to include quarterfinal games as of the 2024-25 season when the CFP expands to a 12-team format.\nHow does a team qualify for the NY6 bowl games?\nA selection committee ranks the best four teams in the country and selects them for the College Football Playoff semifinal games. Those teams compete for a chance to play in the National Championship.\nThe other four NY6 bowl games are typically given to champions from the Power Five conferences and the top-rated teams and champions from the Group of Five conferences.\nWhat is the College Football Playoff National Championship?\nThe CFP National Championship is the final game in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision season, crowning the country\u2019s best team. The winners of the two CFP semifinal games square off in this contest, usually slated for a Monday in early January.\nThe game, which started in 2014 after replacing the Bowl Championship Series, attracts millions of viewers.

Making your bets when the lines are first released gives you the best odds and potential winnings but with precious little information.\nYou might back a team that\u2019s clearly not going to win by Week 4.\nThe longer you wait, the clearer the picture becomes, thanks to data and team performance, but the odds tighten up because sportsbooks are using that same information to make adjustments. You\u2019ll have a more educated choice, but the odds will be less favorable and your payout smaller.\n\nThis article, authored by Travis Pulver, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-15 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":433}
{"title":"Dear Disney: If you want to last another century, lay off the legacy","context":"## Dear Disney: If you want to last another century, lay off the legacy\n\nWalt Disney Animation\u2019s newest movie, Wish, is the culmination of the studio\u2019s celebration of its own centennial. That project stretched throughout 2023, through projects like the short Once Upon a Studio, specialized merchandise drops centered around each decade the company has been around, and the rebrand of the iconic Disney castle logo. But Wish leans so hard on celebrating the better Disney films that came before it that it doesn\u2019t have much identity of its own. It\u2019s openly a nostalgia-fest, pretty much on par with the other ways the company celebrated its 100-year anniversary.\nIn 2023, Disney drilled in harder than ever on looking admiringly at its own history. And why shouldn\u2019t it? The company has a full century of beloved movies, characters, and storytelling to mine for big emotion. Even people who\u2019ve outgrown Disney probably still have residual fondness for at least one of the animated movies they watched in their youth. But nostalgia-bait isn\u2019t limited to Disney\u2019s big birthday celebration: It\u2019s basically what the company has been selling for decades now.\nWhile living in and echoing its own past has been profitable for Disney, it isn\u2019t sustainable. And ultimately, harping so hard on its own glory days is pretty antithetical to Disney\u2019s legacy. In order to move forward, it needs to shed the nostalgia \u2014 or at least not make it the company\u2019s primary selling point.\nNostalgia is safe\nFrom a moneymaking standpoint, it\u2019s easy to see why Disney sticks to legacy-linked projects: They\u2019re all but guaranteed to make bank. Disney\u2019s live-action remakes and sequels consistently get mixed to poor reviews, but they make hundreds of millions of dollars. People will pay to see their faves on screens again, or to try to share their happy childhood memories with their own children.\nAt least, they will until they get tired of the diminished returns. The live-action remakes might make a lot of money in the short run, but all they\u2019re really doing is reiterating what Disney has done in the past, without meaningfully adding to the original movies\u2019 legacy.\nRemember the Disney sequel era? When Disney pumped out cheap direct-to-home-video titles based on every beloved Disney movie from The Fox and the Hound to The Lion King? Disney tries not to. After John Lasseter took over as Disney\u2019s chief creative officer in 2006, he canned the whole DTV department a year later, reportedly denouncing the way cheaply made sequels diminished the Disney brand. Even though Disney loves to celebrate its past, the studio rarely references this era.\nEven with a much higher budget and flashier visuals, the live-action remake fad Disney has been riding for the past decade is still contributing to the feeling of nostalgia oversaturation. And the studio\u2019s many spinoffs and reboots don\u2019t help, either. Some of these legacy projects have been good, but even so, the sheer volume of them just doesn\u2019t seem built to last.\nOne of the most recent Disney live-action projects announced is a rendition of 2016\u2019s animated hit Moana \u2014 a great movie that hasn\u2019t even really had a chance to build its own legacy. The kids who watched it when it first came out are mostly still kids. But Disney is now assuming that anything it makes will have an instant legacy, without actually letting the nostalgia naturally brew on its own.\nDisney\u2019s brand management of Star Wars, Marvel, Fox, the Muppets, and a host of other properties only emphasizes this oversaturation. The Disney empire stretches far and wide these days, and characters like Baby Yoda and Tony Stark sit alongside Mickey Mouse and Cinderella in theme parks, on Disney Plus promotional material, and on Bob Iger\u2019s X header. Disney plays up \u201cDisney Magic\u201d as part of its brand. But when every major franchise in America is lumped together as Disney magic, what\u2019s left?\nInnovation is Disney\u2019s real legacy\nOver the past 100 years, Disney has taken some big, risky swings, and has fumbled many, many times. From the dark and dreary Black Cauldron, which almost bankrupted the studio in 1985, to the off-kilter adventure movies of the early 2000s, the studio\u2019s mold-breaking passion projects have often been megaflops. But at the same time, some of the company\u2019s most memorable movies have stemmed from these risks.\nThe original 1940 Fantasia was one of Walt Disney\u2019s most ambitious passion projects turned box-office failures, but the Sorcerer Mickey short is as iconic as the mouse himself. Lilo & Stitch was so damn weird that the filmmakers basically hid it from the rest of the company; it ended up making back more than three times its budget, and more importantly, turning Stitch into one of the studio\u2019s most memorable characters. And even The Little Mermaid, the film that kickstarted the Disney Renaissance, was a risk; a big Broadway-style musical of its type just hadn\u2019t been done in animation before.\nAfter all, Walt Disney himself famously pushed for progress and innovation, especially in the studio\u2019s creative endeavors, even when that translated into poor financial decisions. What\u2019s made his studio so special over the past century is how it\u2019s looked forward, trying new things even in the face of failure and taking chances that other production houses couldn\u2019t afford or risk. The company\u2019s biggest legacy isn\u2019t the princesses, the theme parks, or even Mickey Mouse: It\u2019s how all those elements started out as daring projects that no one else was doing.\nAnd yet Disney and its fans apparently keep forgetting that, and keep clinging to the past with such ardor that it does their idol\u2019s legacy a disservice.\nThere\u2019s a time and place for the past\nNostalgia isn\u2019t a bad thing, nor is it entirely at odds with Walt Disney. Even in his quest for innovation, Walt was a nostalgic guy who idealized \u201cthe good old days,\u201d to the point where he modeled the entrances of his theme parks after how his hometown looked at the turn of the 20th century. I, certainly, am not immune to Disney nostalgia. I love Disney. I have multiple Disney-themed plushies. I teared up when I watched Once Upon a Studio. I launched an entire yearlong content package so I could celebrate Disney.\nBut nostalgia is a potent ingredient, and it works best in the Disney recipe for success when it\u2019s on the side: in celebratory shorts, theme-park parades, and collectible merchandise. Not when it\u2019s the main offering. For most of the past century, Walt Disney Studios was a movie studio first, and a storefront, streaming service, and theme-park empire second.\nIt feels like that balance has shifted over the last decade. And if Disney wants to last another century, and make things that actually spark new nostalgia down the line, it should go back to embracing fresh, different ideas.\nHardcore Disney fans aren\u2019t always keen on new things. They cry out for a return to their favorites, the memory of watching a Disney movie for the first time. Maybe that means demanding animated Disney movies have proper villains again. Maybe it means asking for more musicals \u2014 or fewer of them. Maybe it\u2019s lamenting the loss of traditional 2D animation. Maybe it\u2019s specifically missing the animated musical sequences of the Disney Renaissance. There are even people who yearn for a return to the animal-focused movies of the 1970s. Whatever that Disney draw is, it\u2019s different for every single person.\nAnd because Disney fans have so many separate, individualized desires, it\u2019s impossible for the company to focus on meeting every single one of them. Besides, more often than not, even though people cry out for the good old days, what they\u2019re really missing is the feeling of discovering something new \u2014 that first viewing of a movie that will become a lasting favorite. Trying to check off all the items on a checklist that doesn\u2019t even really describe what people want\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make good movies. It barely makes tolerable ones.\nWith 100 years of creative life under its belt, Walt Disney Studios has a lot to be proud of. But Mickey Mouse didn\u2019t become a staple overnight. Before Mickey was an icon, before the Disney Princess brand was even a thing, before Disney owned a million other entertainment companies, Disney filmmakers were trying daring things, while making a lot of costly mistakes along the way. But each of those mistakes was an opportunity, a legacy of its own that helped usher in the great movies the studio is known for.\nThat\u2019s not a message that executives and shareholders want to hear. But you don\u2019t get to a hundred-year legacy by playing it safe. You need to have faith and trust in storytelling, in the creative minds behind the great movies, in the power of progress. And a little pixie dust doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\n\nThis article, authored by Petrana Radulovic, was published by Polygon on 2023-12-12 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":434}
{"title":"Twitch is the best way to watch sports, when you can actually watch sports on Twitch","context":"## Twitch is the best way to watch sports, when you can actually watch sports on Twitch\n\nTwitch is the best way to watch sports, when you can actually watch sports on Twitch\nShare All sharing options for: Twitch is the best way to watch sports, when you can actually watch sports on Twitch\nNeed a new way to watch sports? Twitch might be exactly what you\u2019ve been looking for.\nIt\u2019s no secret that fans have historically consumed sports through live events and cable TV, but as media consumption has shifted, many \u2014 especially in younger generations \u2014 have sought out sports content on social platforms.\nTwitch in particular has become a platform where sports streamers and fans have flocked. During the COVID-19 shutdowns in 2020, athletes and sports leagues around the world joined the platform to stream video games when live sports were temporarily on hiatus \u2014 and years later, some of them are still active. WNBA player Aerial Powers regularly streams herself playing games like NBA 2K and Apex Legends, while Argentinian former soccer player Sergio Ag\u00fcero uses his channel to livestream Kings League and Queens League games. Organizations like the NBA, the NFL, and the UFC have their own Twitch channels where they promote and share content. For instance, the UFC runs watch-along streams hosted by former mixed martial artist, boxer, and kickboxer Jens Pulver.\nPolygon is celebrating TwitchCon 2023 with a package of stories covering streaming trends and news from the show. Check it out!\nIn recent years, Twitch has introduced a TwitchSports channel as well as a stand-alone sports category to help users find live sporting events and sports-related content. On the stand-alone sports category page \u2014 which, as of publication, has 2.7 million followers \u2014 users can find creators commentating and analyzing various sports, reaction and watch-along streams, some live sports feeds, and streams of creators playing sports video games. Take a look and you\u2019ll see everything from motorsports and soccer to tennis, volleyball, and even pickleball.\nEnterpriseAppsToday reported that in 2023, Twitch\u2019s \u201cSports\u201d category registered around 8 million hours of watch time. YPulse survey research from April found that 66% of Gen Zers are tuning into platforms like Twitch to follow their favorite sports. \u201cIn contrast to the more spectator-oriented sports watching of earlier generations, Gen Z has evolved the experience into an interactive digital experience through social and streaming platforms,\u201d says Anastasia Pelot, YPulse\u2019s content marketing manager.\nWhile livestreams of major league games are less common to find on Twitch due to broadcast rights, some leagues \u2014 nationally and globally \u2014 have experimented with streaming games in recent years. The NBA signed a deal with Twitch in 2017 to stream minor league games while giving fans the chance to interact with each other. The two also teamed up in 2019 for a separate deal to exclusively stream USA Basketball games globally. When Amazon began airing Thursday Night Football games last fall, Nielsen reported a total viewership figure of 13 million for its first exclusive game, which included U.S. Prime Video subscribers who streamed on Twitch.\nTwitch creator EsfandTV, who requested to go by Esfand for this story, is a streamer with 1.2 million followers who follow not only for gaming content, but for his sports streaming as well. He says that broadcast rights are one of the aspects hindering Twitch from becoming a full-blown sports streaming platform. Leagues still own the rights when it comes to where sports are aired, and Esfand says they need to adapt if they want to reach young and international sports fans.\n\u201cThe NBA is king,\u201d Esfand says. \u201cWhen it comes to hockey, the NHL is king. But what\u2019s happening is these different leagues, they are the boss. They\u2019re the governing body. They have all the rights to everything and when it comes to content, they can be in control.\u201d\nEsfand says if done properly, a league can partner with a streamer that has a large audience and find a way to allow rights to reduce the barrier to entry for users. \u201cYou can\u2019t just block it out in certain markets,\u201d Esfand says. \u201cWhen I did a stream [of a football game], I think Canada couldn\u2019t watch. Most of Europe couldn\u2019t watch.\u201d\nSome leagues have partnered with streamers and have yielded successful results: LiveMode and FIFA partnered with Brazilian streamer Casimito to broadcast the 2022 World Cup on Twitch in Latin America, while the Men in Blazers podcast hosted its popular live watch-along shows for some World Cup matches in the U.S. Earlier this year, Casimito also struck a deal to stream the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup on his channel. The NBA also signed a deal in 2021 with Alexandre \u201cGaules\u201d Borba Chiqueta and Budweiser to stream games in Brazilian markets.\n\u201cThese are the things that, if they\u2019re done the right way, you are now attracting the younger audience who is not watching cable TV as much anymore,\u201d Esfand says.\nIn place of regularly streaming games, Esfand has found other ways to engage with fans on his channel. Esfand\u2019s Tailgate Tour, where he visits college towns and showcases college football culture \u2014 everything from the tailgating atmosphere to the energy inside the stadium \u2014 resonates strongly with young and global fans, especially those who might not be familiar with American college traditions.\nIn April, he livestreamed Esfand\u2019s Draft Night Extravaganza on Twitch. The broadcast coincided with the first day of the NFL draft and featured a mix of Twitch creators like Will Neff and Erobb221 as well as current and former NFL players including Austin Ekeler, Micah Parsons, and Kenny Vaccaro, where they provided analysis and commentary on draft picks.\n\u201cI have people that have been watching me for years playing World of Warcraft or doing something that isn\u2019t football, but they\u2019re actually huge football fans\u201d\nIn some cases, fans preferred Esfand\u2019s show to the traditional broadcast. \u201cI havent watched or cared about football in like 10 years but i still watched this whole stream and loved it,\u201d one viewer commented on YouTube, where the Twitch stream was uploaded after airing.\nAnother user wrote, \u201cI love all things football and I pretty much had the draft on TV muted while watching your stream.\u201d\nEsfand says he feels fortunate he\u2019s been able to stream more sports content on his channel over the last few years, to the point where people have recognized him solely for his football content. He adds that it\u2019s been interesting seeing fans evolve from those that were fans of his gaming streams to ones who are sports fans, or discovering gaming fans who are also sports fans.\n\u201cI have people that have been watching me for years playing World of Warcraft or doing something that isn\u2019t football, but they\u2019re actually huge football fans,\u201d Esfand says. \u201cA big part of Twitch is that people like watching streamers they can relate to. Because what happens is, it\u2019s not just about the streamer; it\u2019s also about the streamer\u2019s chat. Now they are getting involved in the community, whether it\u2019s just through chat itself or through Discord.\u201d\nAlex Casassovici, founder and CEO of Azarus, a company that works with online creators to enhance the streaming experience, says that livestreaming sports and sports-related content on platforms like Twitch creates a more intimate experience for streamers and fans alike.\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re looking at is either a very curated kind of managed channel, and more grassroots-like, creator-led experiences,\u201d Casassovici says. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly something that can be differentiated when it comes to streaming.\u201d\nTwitch seems to see value when it comes to investing in sports streamers. A few years ago, the platform launched the Sports Accelerator Program to support sports content creators wanting to get into \u201csports talk,\u201d like podcasts, talk shows, reaction streams, sidecasts, watch-alongs, and more, through live workshops and by providing opportunities to network and expand their viewership.\nU.K.-based Keira Megan, who goes by keirameganxx on Twitch and was previously part of the Sports Accelerator Program, has been on the platform for about a year and a half with a focus on soccer and motorsports like Formula 1. While Formula 1 has always been primarily popular in Europe, it\u2019s seen growth among new fans in the United States in recent years, thanks in part to docuseries like Netflix\u2019s Drive to Survive.\nWhile she doesn\u2019t stream actual races or games due to broadcast rights, Megan hosts watch-along streams for fans who want to hear her commentary.

They asked me three days later about a [soccer] match. They want to talk about it. I think Twitch is good for that. I think it\u2019s good for one-on-one.

{"title":"Creation of quantum dots wins 2023 chemistry Nobel","context":"## Creation of quantum dots wins 2023 chemistry Nobel\n\nListen to this story: Have feedback on the audio version of this story? Let us know!\nTypically, matter made of the same kinds of atoms arranged in the same way has the same properties. But tiny specks called quantum dots are special. They can contain the same molecules yet have different colors and other qualities depending on their size. The ability to make a whole rainbow of quantum dots simply by tweaking their size makes the dots highly useful. They light up TV screens and help doctors see inside the body. Now, the 2023 Nobel Prize in chemistry honors three scientists who discovered and created quantum dots.\nOne of those scientists is Moungi Bawendi. He\u2019s a chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. The second winner is chemist Louis Brus. He\u2019s based at Columbia University in New York City. The final winner is Alexei Ekimov. This physicist now works at Nanocrystals Technology, Inc., in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.\nThe trio will split a prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or about $1 million. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the honor October 4.\nChemist Moungi Bawendi (left), chemist Louis Brus (middle) and physicist Alexei Ekimov (right) have split the 2023 Nobel prize in chemistry. MIT, Columbia University, Nexdot\nA new kind of material\n\u201cQuantum dots are a new class of materials, different from molecules,\u201d said Heiner Linke. A member of the Nobel committee, he spoke at the award announcement.\nQuantum dots are each a few billionths of a meter across. At such a tiny scale, their qualities are governed by the weird laws of quantum mechanics. Those quantum laws rule that changing the dots\u2019 size alters their properties. That includes how the dots interact with light and electricity. It also includes their magnetic properties and at what temperature they melt.\nOne useful quality that changes with a quantum dot\u2019s size is its color. Usually, \u201cif you want to make different colors with molecules, you would choose a new molecule,\u201d Linke said. That is, a new set of atoms arranged in a different structure.\nBut changing a quantum dot\u2019s size can change its color without changing its molecules. Quantum dots give off fluorescent light of different colors when they are bathed in laser light. Smaller dots give off bluer light. Bigger dots give off redder light.\nDots of the same size made from different materials may give off slightly different colors. Quantum dots are usually made from semiconductors. Such materials include graphene, selenite or metal sulfides. By adjusting the sizes and materials of quantum dots, chemists can alter their properties for a huge range of uses.\nPossible after all\nScientists suspected that nanoparticles\u2019 sizes could alter their properties nearly a century ago. But at the time, it seemed impossible to actually make such particles. To do that, researchers would need a material with a perfect crystal structure. They\u2019d also have to be able to control the size of that tiny speck extremely precisely. So precisely, in fact, that they\u2019d have to sculpt the particle one layer of atoms at a time.\nThen, in the early 1980s, Ekimov and Brus each showed this could be done. The two did not work together. Ekimov created quantum dots with glass. Adding copper chloride to the glass produced tiny crystals. Ekimov then showed that the size of those crystals was linked to the color of the glass.\nBrus made a similar discovery. He showed that there was a link between size and color for nanosize particles floating in a solution or in a gas.\nThose discoveries stirred up intense interest in how such dots could be used. But making quantum dots for specific uses would require precisely controlling the dots\u2019 size.\nEducators and Parents, Sign Up for The Cheat Sheet Weekly updates to help you use Science News Explores in the learning environment Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\nA decade later, Bawendi devised a method to do just that. His technique allowed him to stop the growth of tiny crystals in a solution when they reached a desired size. Here\u2019s how it worked. He first injected chemicals into a solution that instantly formed tiny crystals. Then, he tweaked the temperature of the solution to halt the crystals\u2019 growth.\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply honored and surprised and shocked by the announcement this morning,\u201d Bawendi said October 4. He spoke at an MIT news conference. \u201cI\u2019m especially honored to share this with Lou Brus,\u201d Bawendi said of his mentor. \u201cI tried to emulate his scholarship and his mentoring style as a professor myself when I came to MIT.\u201d\nBawendi started working on quantum dots after meeting Brus. The two worked at Nokia Bell Labs, headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J. There, researchers needed high-quality quantum dots to study the physics of nanoparticles.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I wanted to make the best quantum dots possible for application,\u201d Bawendi said. \u201cIt was because we needed to make the best possible quantum dots to study them.\u201d It took years of trial and error to work out the method.\nIn this microscope image, quantum dots light up mouse intestines. Red and green represent proteins illuminated by fluorescing quantum dots. Provided by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Image by Thomas Deerinck and Mark Ellisman\/National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research\nApplications abound\nBawendi\u2019s work made it possible to manufacture quantum dots with specific sizes \u2014 and therefore specific properties. This opened up a world of possible uses for the dots.\nFor one thing, quantum dots can be used to subtly change the color of LED lights. This can dramatically improve the lights\u2019 energy efficiency.\nQuantum dots are also useful in medicine. They can be injected into the body and attached to cells from the body\u2019s immune system. Such cells swarm cancerous tissues. By tagging the cells with fluorescent quantum dots, surgeons can spot even hard-to-see tumors inside the body.\nQuantum dots can also be tuned to absorb different colors of light. So they could be used to build solar panels that soak up sunlight well in different conditions. The dots may even be used to build quantum computers. Such computers promise to run much faster than any normal computer ever could.\nThis year\u2019s chemistry Nobel is well-deserved, says Warren Chan. He\u2019s a biomedical engineer and chemist at the University of Toronto in Canada. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who built the foundation,\u201d Chan says of the winners. \u201cI\u2019m really happy that the field is getting credit for really changing the world.\u201d\nChan and his colleagues found one of the first uses for quantum dots in the 1990s. Their group used quantum dots to tag cells in lab experiments. But the Nobel committee doesn\u2019t just look at past impacts of a discovery, Chan notes. They also consider the effects a discovery may have in the future. And quantum dots could have a whole medley of uses not yet explored. Chan\u2019s team, for instance, is now using quantum dots to detect infections such as flu and HIV.\n\u201cI was absolutely thrilled to see this,\u201d says Judith Giordan. She\u2019s the president of the American Chemical Society. \u201cWe have three people recognized who brought this technology from a dream, a hope, a theoretical construct \u2026 all the way through synthesis and manufacture.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Tina Hesman Saey, was published by Science News For Students on 2023-10-04 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":436}
{"title":"Hottest seat on each NFC team: Buns burning for these four head coaches","context":"## Hottest seat on each NFC team: Buns burning for these four head coaches\n\nEven the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys \u2013 two of the NFL's best teams \u2013 have hot seats. No seats, however, may be more sizzling than those occupied by two head coaches in the NFC South, one in the NFC North and another (surprisingly) in the NFC West.\nHere is the hottest seat on each NFC team as determined by Yardbarker NFL writers.\nNFC East\nDALLAS COWBOYS | Cornerback Trevon Diggs: In September, Diggs suffered a season-ending ACL injury. His replacement, DaRon Bland, has wowed us with an NFL-record five pick-sixes. There's no way Bland can go back to slot corner in 2024, so the heat will be on Diggs next season as a probable replacement for Stephon Gilmore at left cornerback.\nNEW YORK GIANTS | Quarterback Daniel Jones: Out for the season with an ACL injury, Jones has no way to dissuade Giants ownership from taking a quarterback high in the QB-rich 2024 NFL Draft. New York can (and will) get out of his $160M contract in 2025.\nPHILADELPHIA EAGLES | Wide receiver Quez Watkins: Philadelphia\u2019s supposed No. 3 receiver has a measly four catches for 21 yards. While he missed five games with a hamstring injury, Olamide Zaccheaus and Julio Jones combined for 132 yards receiving and three touchdowns.\nWASHINGTON COMMANDERS | Owner Josh Harris: He oversaw the controversial \u201cProcess\u201d as owner of the Philadelphia 76ers. He\u2019ll need a better plan this offseason when \u201cI\u2019m not Dan Snyder\u201d stops working. At 4-8, the Commanders are floundering in his first season of ownership. \u2014 Bruce Ewing\nNFC West\nARIZONA CARDINALS | Quarterback Kyler Murray: The inconsistent Murray has five more games this season to prove to a new front office and coaching staff that he is the long-term answer at quarterback. If he doesn\u2019t show them what they want to see, the Cardinals have the draft capital (including two first-round picks) to land a franchise quarterback at the top of the QB-rich 2024 NFL Draft.\nLOS ANGELES RAMS | Wide receiver Cooper Kupp: At his peak, he was one of the best offensive players in the league, but age (30) and injuries (appearing in 16 of a possible 28 games the past two seasons) have hurt his production. He has been a non-factor over the past five games (12 catches for 127 yards) while young receivers Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell have stepped up.\nSAN FRANCISCO 49ERS | Head coach Kyle Shanahan: The 49ers have done almost everything possible under Shanahan except win a Super Bowl. Fair or not, not winning a title with a stacked roster \u2014 especially on offense (Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel, Brock Purdy, George Kittle) \u2014 would be a massive disappointment. His job is in zero danger, but his rep may be.\nSEATTLE SEAHAWKS | Quarterback Geno Smith: The Seahawks passed on drafting a QB in 2023 and re-signed Smith, but he has taken a significant step back. Entering Thursday's game against Dallas, his completion percentage was down from 2022 (69.8 to 65.4 percent) despite the impressive offensive weapons around him. Seattle has an out in his contract after this season that would only carry a $17.4 million dead-cap number, per Spotrac. \u2014 Adam Gretz\nNFC North\nCHICAGO BEARS | Head coach Matt Eberflus: The Bears have only one division win during Eberflus' tenure and his seven wins are the fewest by a Bears head coach through his first 29 games. In his second season as HC, the defense has improved, but positive results are hard to come by behind a lackluster offense ranked 19th in yards (323.2) and 21st in points per game (20.2).\nDETROIT LIONS | Defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn: The Lions finished near the bottom of the NFL in points against (31st and 28th) the past two seasons and are on pace to do so again for the third time in as many years under Glenn (24th, 23.5). Furthermore, the unit has regressed in 2023, with opponents averaging 29 points per game since Week 7 (five games).\nGREEN BAY PACKERS | Wide receiver Christian Watson: The popular choice to emerge as the team's No. 1 wideout, he has underachieved in his second season, outshined by fellow 2022 draftee Romeo Doubs (seven TDs) and rookie Jayden Reed (five TDs). Watson had his best game in Week 12 (five receptions, 94 yards, one TD), but was nearly invisible before that, recording 16 catches (257 yards) and two TDs over seven games.\nMINNESOTA VIKINGS | Running back Alexander Mattison: He has floundered in his first season as the starter, producing zero rushing TDs on a career-best 13.2 attempts a game and ranking 22nd among qualified backs in yards per carry (3.8). He's still getting more snaps than second-year RB Ty Chandler, but the Vikings will likely look for a replacement this offseason if Mattison doesn't show more. \u2014 Mike Santa Barbara\nNFC South\nATLANTA FALCONS | Quarterback Desmond Ridder: The Falcons have a golden path toward a division crown, but Ridder\u2019s two-interception performance against the Saints in Week 12 was another reminder Atlanta isn\u2019t a legitimate contender with him. He\u2019ll finish the season leading the Falcons, who will probably get a home playoff game, but the clock is ticking on Ridder\u2019s time as an NFL starter.\nCAROLINA PANTHERS | General manager Scott Fitterer: Owner David Tepper should have the hottest seat, but he isn\u2019t going to fire himself. Instead, when he runs out of people on the sidelines to fire, he\u2019ll take out his frustration on a GM (partly) responsible for constructing the least impressive roster in football.\nNEW ORLEANS SAINTS | Head coach Dennis Allen: New Orleans' 5-6 record against the league\u2019s easiest schedule is bad. What's worse, however, is running back Alvin Kamara\u2019s concerning claim after a 24-15 loss to the Falcons that the team doesn\u2019t have an identity. Allen \u2014 who has a 20-44 record as head coach of the Raiders and Saints \u2014 needs a playoff appearance or there could be big changes in New Orleans.\nTAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS | Head coach Todd Bowles: At 4-7, the Bucs are only a game back of first in the division, but they are fading fast, going 1-6 in their past seven games. The team\u2019s lapses on defense (363.7 YPG\/27th) \u2013 supposedly Bowles' area of expertise \u2013 are most concerning. \u2014 Eric Smithling\n\nThis article, authored by Yardbarker Staff, was published by Yardbarker on 2023-11-30 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":437}

It wasn't until 50 seconds into the fourth quarter that Las Vegas finally picked up the first touchdown, with Michael Mayer making a leaping grab in the end zone to put the Raiders up 16-9.\nIn such a low-scoring game, that touchdown felt, even as early as it was, that it could be a game-winner.

Mosley was injured on the play, and has to come off the field.\n10:56 p.m.: O'Connell tries a deep shot to Adams to start the drive, but the star receiver is double-covered. Jacobs gets Las Vegas back on schedule by racing his way up the middle for nine yards to set up a third-and-1, just stumbling short. He picks up that yard on a carry the next play to keep the chains moving.\n10:54 p.m.: Raiders will start at the 25 with 11:58 to play.\n10:51 p.m. Jets scoring play: The Jets offense stalls after a throw from Garrett Wilson on a trick play to Lazard misses, then a low throw from Zach Wilson to Cook that's missed as well. Wilson escapes pressure from the Raiders and manages a yard, but the call is to Zuerlein to boot the field goal. Raiders 16, Jets 12\n10:48 p.m.: Trading explosive plays now. First Jacobs with the big run, now Hall catches a screen pass, and he bursts down the left sideline for 35 yards to the Las Vegas 40. Then Garrett Wilson makes a wide-open grab for 13 to the Raiders' 28.\nBreece Hall just turned the screen pass into a 35-yard gain \ud83d\ude33\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #NYJvsLV on NBC\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https:\/\/t.co\/lfCP1NFAnO pic.twitter.com\/aCOdKjJEkr \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 13, 2023\n10:47 p.m.: Jets start at the 25.\n10:45 p.m. Raiders scoring play: O'Connell fakes a sweep to Jacobs and throws a touchdown pass to a leaping Mayer in the end zone. First touchdown of the game comes with 14:10 left. Raiders 16, Jets 9\nThird quarter\n10:41 p.m.: Mayer drops a pass on first down, then Jacobs explodes down the field, racing up 40 yards to the Jets' 13. Carter punches out the football at the end of the run, but it rolls harmlessly out of bounds. Jacobs takes the next carry for five yards to wind down the third quarter with the Raiders now at the Jets' 8.\n10:35 p.m.: Wilson to Wilson gains five to start the drive, but Zach is brought down the next play on a sack and the ball got loose. Mekhi Becton jumps on the ball to avoid disaster. Wilson tries to get the first down the next play with a deep shot to Taylor down the middle but it sails well over his head. New York punts, and Carter returns the ball 10 yards to the Raiders' 46 as Las Vegas again gets favorable field position to start a drive.\n10:34 p.m.: Gipson attempts a kickoff return, but is brought down at the Jets 13 for a short return.\n10:29 p.m. Raiders scoring play: Offense keeps trying to go through Jacobs, with him getting blown up for a loss of four before getting five yards on a toss to the right. But O'Connell way overthrows Adams, and the Raiders have to settle for the 40-yard field goal to tie the game with 2:36 left in the third quarter. Adams was furious there wasn't a penalty. All kicks so far tonight. Jets 9, Raiders 9\n10:27 p.m.: O'Connell rifles a quick pass out to Hunter Renfrow, who races up and gets near the line of scrimmage but is just inches shy of the line. The Raiders opt to go for it and hand the ball to Jacobs, who finds a hole on the right side and gets the necessary yardage to the Jets 23 for the first.\n10:26 p.m.: For the second time today, O'Connell takes a bad sack out to the Jets 42 that takes the Raiders out of field-goal range, but Jacobs catches a short pass and runs it up \u2014 ruled a carry since it was a lateral \u2014 for 12 yards to bring up a much more manageable third-and-6.\n10:25 p.m.: Following a rush of no gain by Jacobs, Meyers makes a catch in front of a few defenders and makes them miss to pick up eight yards. O'Connell then goes with a pop pass to Jacobs, who bursts to the right sideline for three yards and the first down to the Jets 34.\n10:19 p.m.: Quick three-and-out by the Jets, as Wilson steps up and fires an incompletion and Hall is brought down for a loss of a yard by Butler. After a false start to make it third-and-16, Wilson escapes out on the right side and manages to get 13 yards before stumbling and fall three shy of the first. Las Vegas gets an excellent return by Carter along the sideline, as he takes the punt from the Raiders 23 up to the Jets 46 for a 31-yard return.\n10:14 p.m.: O'Connell tries to throw a tight end screen to Mayer, but has to spike it as his tight end was well contained. Gipson returns the punt five yards up to the Jets' 15 as the Jets prepare for their next drive.\n10:11 p.m.: Impressive solo tackle by Quinnen Williams getting to Jacobs almost as soon as he gets the handoff in the backfield for a loss of three. Tre Tucker gets an end-around for nine yards to set up a much more manageable third-and-4. O'Connell scrambles for five to the left and gets the yardage, but for once, a penalty goes against the Raiders as a holding flag brings up a third-and-14 for the Raiders.\n10:05 p.m.: Conklin gets a nice reception that would have brought up a fourth-and-4. The Jets are flagged for holding, which is accepted by the Raiders rather than taking the punt. Wilson gets a quick pass out to Malik Taylor for six yards, and now the Jets will punt. DeAndre Carter returns the punt six yards from the Raiders' 25 to 31, where Las Vegas will start its first drive of the second half.\n10:04 p.m.: A low incompletion by Wilson to Wilson and a pickup of just two from Hall gets the Jets' drive off to a slow start. Wilson appeared to get a first down with a throw out to Gipson for 12 yards, but Carter is flagged for a chop block that vaults the Jets back to a third-and-21 at their own 14. Another rough penalty for the Jets, who now have six penalties for 68 yards.\n10:02 p.m.: The Jets will begin the second half from their own 25 on a touchback.\nSecond quarter\n9:45 p.m. Raiders scoring play: O'Connell misses Adams on back-to-back passes, and the Raiders opt to turn the ball to Jacobs for a yard before using their final timeout. Daniel Carlson drills the 54-yard field goal to make this a three-point game at the end of the first half. Jets 9, Raiders 6\n9:43 p.m.: This time, a brutal Jets penalty on defense. O'Connell gets a pass out to Mayer for five yards, but Bryce Huff is flagged for roughing the passer that moves the Raiders all the way to the Jets 37 with 21 seconds.\n9:42 p.m.: Raiders start a bit conservative with a run of six by Jacobs before O'Connell gets a quick pass out to Adams on the left side, giving the receiver space to pick up nine yards before going out of bounds to stop the clock with 32 seconds left in the half. He then dumps off a quick pass to Jacobs, who picks up eight before going out and stopping the clock at 26 seconds.\n9:39 p.m.: Conklin makes a catch up the middle for eight yards, but on the next play, Wilson tries to scramble out of the pocket and has to run for a loss of a yard. Wilson then fires incomplete to Allen Lazard, who was racing down the left sideline. Jets punt the ball into the end zone for a touchback.\n9:38 p.m.: Following a run of seven by Hall, Zach Wilson misses a pass attempt out to Garrett Wilson. Then the QB scrambles out to his left and takes off down the left sideline for 20 yards to the Jets' 41. He's now the team's leading rusher with two carries for 40 yards on the ground.\n9:36 p.m.: Jets take the fair catch at their own 14. They've got 1:52 to make something happen.\n9:34 p.m.: A pair of promising passing plays go for naught. Jakobi Meyers makes a few defenders miss on a nice catch for 13 yards, then O'Connell fires a strike to Adams for a pickup of 18 yards. But the Jets' pass-rush finally gets home as O'Connell is sacked, pressured into throwing out of bounds then sacked again. Raiders pushed from the New York 26 all the way back to the Jets' 46, and will now likely have to punt coming out of the two-minute warning.\n9:29 p.m.: Jacobs came into the drive with just three total carries, but he's now carried it five straight times for 20 yards. O'Connell then picks up the third-and-1 by sneaking it for three yards.\n9:27 p.m.: Three straight runs by Jacobs, punctuated by an impressive, shifty, five-yard run gets the Raiders the first down up to the Las Vegas 31.\n9:22 p.m.: Needing only a yard, the Jets' backs come up short on both attempts, with Cook and Hall both being bottled up at the line of scrimmage for no gain. Jets decide to punt the ball from their own 38, and it goes into the end zone for a touchback. Raiders back on offense from their own 20 with 7:18 left in the half.\n9:20 p.m.: Cook bounces out to the right, and gets out to the 29 for a pickup of 10. He follows that up by speeding to the left and racing up for nine yards to the Jets' 38 before he's brought down by Crosby.\n9:16 p.m.: A pair of runs by Jacobs nets the Raiders just one yard, and O'Connell's deep shot to Adams is well past his intended target. The Raiders go three-and-out, and after an out-of-bounds punt from AJ Cole, the Jets will start at their own 19.\n9:15 p.m.: Raiders will start from their own 25.\n9:15 p.m.: Robertson has been ruled out with a concussion, per the team.\n9:12 p.m. Jets scoring play: Wilson attempts a checkdown to Michael Carter, but the ball is tipped by Adam Butler. New York once again has to settle for a field goal. Jets 9, Raiders 3\n9:09 p.m.: Hall runs for a yard, then is stuffed for no gain trying to get to the outside by Crosby. The Jets use their first timeout before the third-and-goal play from Las Vegas' 12-yard line.\n9:08 p.m.: Stop if you've heard this before: good Jets play, bad Jets penalty. Hall ran for three yards up the middle for a touchdown, but Uzomah was flagged for holding a second time as he tried to block Maxx Crosby and free up space for Hall along the right side. Now a first-and-goal from the Raiders 13.\n9:06 p.m.: Garrett Wilson makes a leaping grab for seven yards before Zach Wilson makes a stellar run along the right sideline. He initially was ruled to be in the end zone, but review confirmed he stepped out at the 3-yard line, making it a 20-yard run from the QB. First-and-goal now for the Jets.\nStepped out at the 3, but Zach Wilson used his legs to get near the end zone \ud83d\udca8\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #NYJvsLV on NBC\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https:\/\/t.co\/lfCP1NFAnO pic.twitter.com\/DZKQE2yZvd \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 13, 2023\n9:05 p.m.: Raiders corner Amik Robertson had to be helped off the field and walked to the sideline. Appeared to be in the fencing response while on the ground.\n9:02 p.m.: Another big Jets play overturned by a penalty. Hall appeared to have the first down for 11 yards, but Laken Tomlinson is flagged for holding. Jets will face a second-and-19.\nFirst quarter\n8:58 p.m.: Hall picks up a yard to bring the quarter to an end.\n8:56 p.m.: O'Connell goes from nearly losing a fumble to throwing an interception right at Jordan Whitehead, who returns the pick out to the Raiders' 26. Raiders are challenging the interception, but since all turnovers are reviewed, their timeout is used.\n8:55 p.m.: Near-disaster to start the drive for the Raiders, as O'Connell muffs the snap under center. He falls on the ball to limit it to just a one-yard loss.\n8:54 p.m.: Raiders will start from their own 25 after a touchback.\n8:51 p.m. Jets scoring play: Wilson threads the needle out to Garrett Wilson, but the receiver can't hang on. Tyler Conklin makes a quick grab for five yards, but the Jets again have to settle for three from Zuerlein. Jets 6, Raiders 3\n8:49 p.m.: Now, Garrett Wilson's getting involved in the running game, taking an end around for 11 yards. However, C.J. Uzomah is called for holding that moves the play back to a second-and-18.\n8:47 p.m.: Garrett Wilson gets back into the passing game, first catching a quick pass on the outside for five yards, then taking a short pass from Wilson up eight yards to the Raiders' 32 for another first down.\n8:45 p.m.: After a pair of runs that picked up six yards from Hall, Wilson throws a deep pass out to Gipson down the right sideline, picking up 24 yards to the Raiders' 45. Jets again using big strikes to move down the field.\n8:44 p.m.: Jets will start their second drive at their own 25 with 6:15 to go in the first quarter.\n8:39 p.m. Raiders scoring play: That penalty winds up stunting the drive. Adams makes an impressive, one-handed grab for eight yards and Michael Mayer picks up seven on a grab over the middle, but he's stopped just short. The Raiders also settle for a field goal, this one from 41 yards out to even the game. Jets 3, Raiders 3\n8:38 p.m.: Right after the big play, Adams is flagged for offensive pass interference on a swing pass to Jacobs. That will move the Raiders back, and bring up a first-and-20.\n8:37 p.m.: Josh Jacobs' first carry is stuffed for only two. But the first big connection between O'Connell and Adams vaults the Raiders up to the Jets' 31 for 42 yards on a nice deep pass over the middle of the field.\nAidan O'Connell stumbled and still found Davante for 42 yards\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #NYJvsLV on NBC\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https:\/\/t.co\/lfCP1NFAnO pic.twitter.com\/qc06xFF0aa \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 13, 2023\n8:35 p.m.: DeAndre Carter returns the kickoff to the Raiders' 25 to start the drive.\n8:31 p.m. Jets scoring play: Dalvin Cook has an impressive seven-yard run, but on third down, Wilson's quick pass to Gipson is dropped. The Jets have to settle for three from Greg Zuerlein. Jets 3, Raiders 0\n8:30 p.m.: Odd play after the explosive. Wilson is brought down, and as he's going down, he tries to flip the ball out. It initially looked like it could've been a fumble, but it is called for intentional grounding. That will bring up a second-and-20 for New York.\n8:29 p.m.: On a play action, the Wilson-Wilson connection is an explosive one, as the receiver catches a hard pass over the middle and streaks down the right sideline before finally being brought down at the Raiders' 26 for a gain of 41.\nPlenty of room to run after the catch for the defending OROY \ud83d\ude24\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #NYJvsLV on NBC\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https:\/\/t.co\/lfCP1NFAnO pic.twitter.com\/eQjJRa6EAY \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 13, 2023\n8:28 p.m.: Zach Wilson to Garrett Wilson, with an impressive throw and catch threading the needle between a pair of defenders on the left side for six yards and a first down.

era ending after India loss, calls for more Tests\n\nAlyssa Healy has rejected any suggestion Australia\u2019s stranglehold on international women\u2019s cricket is slipping, saying their Test loss to India is barely a blip on the team\u2019s record.\nAustralia stumbled to their first Test defeat to India by eight wickets in Mumbai on Sunday, after being outplayed by the hosts in foreign spinning conditions.\nThe loss comes after one of the more difficult periods for the Australian side in the past six years, with the retirements of Meg Lanning and Rachael Haynes.\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\nAfter winning their fourth straight global ICC event earlier this year in the 50-over World Cup, Australia retained the Ashes via a drawn multi-format series in England in July.\nThat tour included losing four of six white-ball matches, with Australia\u2019s win in the Test enough to have them level on points with England and hold onto the trophy.\nThe current tour of India is not a multi-format series, but the defeat in the one-off Test marks Australia\u2019s first loss in a four-day game since January 2014.\nBut quizzed over whether the defeat suggested Australia\u2019s unprecedented period of dominance was ending, Healy was defiant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not even a blip,\u201d Healy said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt (Test cricket) is a format where we\u2019re not overly familiar with, in conditions that we\u2019re not familiar with.\n\u201cI see more positives out of this and than any sort of negativity.\n\u201cThere is always a lot of expectation and external noise about our team and how we\u2019re performing.\n\u201cThey are so used to seeing us winning, that I think, at times, they forget that we\u2019ve actually seen quite a lot of change over the last 12 to 18 months.\n\u201cThat kind of goes unnoticed external to our group.\u201d\nAustralia have spoken about shifting their mindset in white-ball cricket after the losses in England, pursuing a more attacking approach.\nThree looming ODIs against India in the next week and three ensuing T20s will be the first showing of that, with the hosts also a rising force in the white-ball game.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWithin our group we\u2019re really comfortable with where we\u2019re at, and the progression we\u2019re on,\u201d Healy said.\n\u201cUltimately there\u2019s a big T20 World Cup in Bangladesh towards the end of next year, that is a real carrot for us.\n\u201cThese are the sort of big trophies that we\u2019re wanting to win.\n\u201cAnd yes, every series in between now and then is important, but at the same time we\u2019re building towards that World Cup.\n\u201cMaybe you can ask me that (supremacy) question at the end of the six white-ball games to see how we\u2019re going and we can answer that.\n\u201cThese next six games will probably give us a better indication about how we\u2019re tracking but also what we might need to improve on.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHealy called for Australia\u2019s Test series in India to be extended to three matches their loss, their first in 11 Tests against India.\nThe hosts easily chased down 75 in the fourth innings on Sunday.\nAll out for 209 in their first innings, Australia looked far more confident in their second effort of 261 despite the wicket showing more signs of wear.\nAnd Healy believes three-Test tours of India would provide a better match-up between the two sides.\n\u201cIt would create a real contest over three games,\u201d Healy said.\n\u201cThat would be an unbelievable experience for our group, and probably a true test of of both sides\u2019 abilities.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe one-off Test, India playing in their home conditions, you\u2019d expect them to be heavy favourites.\n\u201cBut the way we tried to adapt and continue to learn throughout the four days was really impressive.\n\u201cWe would love to have another crack at it, show what we learned and put it into practice.\u201d\nHealy is realistic in conceding her wish is unlikely to be granted.\nThe last women\u2019s Test series of more than one match was way back in 2006, while India had not hosted any red-ball cricket for nine years before this summer.\n\u201cThe nature of the female game at the moment is it\u2019s very white-ball dominant,\u201d Healy said.\n\u201cTrying to fit it all in to the calendar and fitting all the white-ball games in seems to take precedence.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBut you take three one-day games out, and we could probably play two more Test matches.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s captain is also insistent this Test should have formed part of a multi-format series, in the same way most top-tier women\u2019s tours are now conducted.\nWhile one Test, three ODIs and three T20s will be played, each are individual contests rather than an overarching series in the same way the Ashes is decided.\nAustralia had taken the trophy used from the multi-format 2021-22 series against India to be contested, only to be told by authorities that system would not be used.\n\u201cI sit here disappointed that we couldn\u2019t win the Test match,\u201d Healy said.\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, we weren\u2019t necessarily playing for points, we weren\u2019t playing for overall series points for a trophy.\n\u201cIt does make it a little bit of a novelty in a sense.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe fact that it sort of feels meaningless to a sense is really disappointing to me. But in saying that we are disappointed that we couldn\u2019t get ourselves over the line.\u201d\n\u00a9 AAP\n\nThis article, authored by News, was published by The Roar | Sports Writers Blog on 2023-12-24 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":440}

Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\nThe NBA is home to the world\u2019s best basketball players and teams, with it being the pinnacle of the sport. Throughout its history, iconic figures like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan have left an indelible mark on the league. However, for the better part of the past two decades, players like Stephen Curry, LeBron James and Kevin Durant have dominated the NBA landscape. Their otherworldly talents have continuously captivated the fans across the globe. While LeBron James and Stephen Curry may have accumulated more championships and accolades, Kevin Durant, without a doubt, is universally acknowledged as the best pure talent of his generation.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nKevin Durant stands as one of the most exceptionally skilled players in NBA history. Across his illustrious 17-year career in the league, Durant has solidified his status as a transcendent superstar. His stellar performances over the years have endeared him to millions of fans. However, even with his exceptional talents, Kevin Durant regularly faces disregard from both the media and fans. This has made KD one of the most polarizing figures in basketball. Yet, when one considers the profound impact Durant has made on the NBA, the extent of the disrespect he encounters can seem perplexing at times.\nWhat makes Kevin Durant so polarising?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIt would be an understatement to say that Kevin Durant divides opinions. While some view him as the most skilled basketball player of his generation, others perceive him as a diva who rode the coattails of Stephen Curry to secure his two NBA championships. However, a careful consideration of Kevin Durant\u2019s game-changing impact and the multitude of accolades he has garnered throughout his illustrious career reveals a glaring reality: KD stands as perhaps the most disrespected icon of the sport.\nKevin Durant rose to prominence in 2007, when the Seattle SuperSonics drafted him with the No.2 pick. The NBA had never witnessed a player possessing Durant\u2019s unique skill set\u2014a 6\u201911\u201d forward renowned for his exceptional jump-shot and lethal three-point accuracy. He epitomized the concept of a \u201cUnicorn\u201d in its truest sense.\nMoreover, when one pays close attention to his stats, the disrespect becomes even more perplexing. Kevin Durant has amassed 27,393 points in the regular season, ranking 11th in NBA history. In the playoffs, he has contributed an additional 4,878 points, placing him 7th on the all-time list. Durant is a surefire future first-ballot Hall of Famer, boasting an illustrious resume that few can match. His accomplishments include two NBA titles, two NBA finals MVP awards, four scoring titles, and multiple selections to the All-Star and All-NBA teams.\nDurant\u2019s scuffles with critics\nWhile Durant may rank among the greatest NBA players in history, his vulnerability to criticism and thin-skinned nature has, on several occasions, has got the better of him. NBA legend Charles Barkley called Durant \u201csensitive\u201d in an interview with 60 Minutes. He said, \u201cHe\u2019s very sensitive. Great player. He\u2019s part of that generation who thinks he can\u2019t be criticized.\u201d\nDurant\u2019s susceptibility to criticism became glaringly evident when he utilized a burner account in 2017 to defend himself on Twitter. However, Durant was exposed when he inadvertently failed to switch accounts, posting a tweet through his verified account. Fans also criticize KD for his lack of leadership and his lack of titles since departing from the Warriors. Since his departure in 2019, Durant has not secured an NBA title. Despite forming a formidable trio with Kyrie Irving and James Harden in Brooklyn, their best result was a second-round exit in the 2021 playoffs at the hands of the Milwaukee Bucks.\nUSA Today via Reuters Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\/Reuters\nFans and media strongly disapprove of Kevin Durant\u2019s inclination to switch teams repeatedly, even when he receives substantial support from the organizations. After his Brooklyn experiment didn\u2019t work, KD requested a trade and, on last year\u2019s trade deadline, his wish was granted as the Nets traded him to the Suns. Despite having NBA stars like Devin Booker and Chris Paul as teammates, Durant once again fell short of winning a title with the Suns. Durant\u2019s inability to clinch an NBA title without Curry and the Warriors has heightened the narrative that questions his status as an icon of the game.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nThe decision that tainted Durant\u2019s legacy\nIn the 2016 Western Conference finals, KD-Russ led OKC Thunder faced off against 73-9 Warriors. After swiftly securing a 3-1 series lead, the Thunder seemed poised for an NBA Finals appearance. However, the Warriors orchestrated a remarkable comeback, ultimately winning the series in seven games. This meant that Durant would go trophy-less for another season.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn the 2016 offseason, Durant made a pivotal decision to join the very team that had defeated him in the finals.

Diego Herrera Carcedo | Anadolu | Getty Images\nAt the start of 2023, hopes were high that a much-vaunted Ukrainian counteroffensive \u2014 expected to be launched in the spring \u2014 would change the dial in the war against Russia. It didn't, and the prospect of a breakthrough in 2024 is also unlikely, military experts and defense analysts told CNBC. They predict intense fighting is likely to continue into the next year but say Kyiv's forces are unlikely to launch any more counteroffensives. Russia, meanwhile, is likely to focus on consolidating the territory it has already seized, particularly in eastern Ukraine. Away from the battlefield, military experts said that the trajectory the Russia-Ukraine war takes in 2024 will mostly be dictated thousands of miles away in the U.S., Ukraine's largest military supporter, and whether aid declines in the run-up \u2014 and following \u2014 the U.S. presidential election. \"War is an uncertain endeavor,\" retired Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Twitty, former deputy commander of the U.S. European Command, told CNBC. \"Russia can win the war, or the Ukrainians can win the war. And, as you're seeing things now, if you really think about it, what has been achieved this year? Very little has been achieved by Russia, and you can say the same thing for the Ukrainians,\" he said.\nUkrainian servicemen take part in a military training exercise not far from front line in the Donetsk region on June 8, 2023. Anatolii Stepanov | Afp | Getty Images\n\"We're in this situation now where if there's not a clear winner, there's going to be a stalemate, and there's going to be, perhaps, a future frozen conflict. What can tilt the balance, in my view, is if the Ukrainians are not resupplied and they're not re-funded and they don't get the equipment and people that they need. Then this war could tilt to the Russians,\" Twitty noted.\nExpectations not met\nA year ago, Ukraine's international military support was solid with NATO pledging to support Kyiv for \"as long as it takes\" as it defended itself against Russia's invasion launched in February 2022. Over the summer, however, the challenge facing Ukraine's forces was glaringly obvious as they struggled to break through heavily fortified Russian positions and lines of defenses along a swathe of the 600-mile-long front line across the southern and east of the country. After liberating a handful of villages in the summer, Ukrainian and Russian forces have been caught in largely attritional battles, with neither side making significant gains. Ukrainian military officials have conceded that hopes and expectations of a great breakthrough in the counteroffensive were not met. Still, Ukraine's leadership says that steep losses have been inflicted on Russian forces and that its forces have made vital progress in other areas such as the Black Sea with Ukraine's audacious attacks on Russian bases and assets in Crimea this summer prompting the Russian navy to withdraw a number of warships from Sevastopol, handing Kyiv a victory in the battle of the Black Sea.\nPanorama of the city from a bird's-eye view, shot on a drone, covered with snow on December 7, 2023 in Avdiivka, Ukraine. Libkos | Getty Images\nWeather conditions are deteriorating in Ukraine, with mud, freezing rain, snow and ice making offensive and reconnaissance operations challenging. Intense fighting continues nonetheless, and particularly around Bakhmut and Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine where Russian forces are conducting offensive operations and have made some recent, confirmed advances. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted last week that Russian forces have likely committed to offensive operations in multiple sectors of the front, during a period of the most challenging weather of the fall-winter season, \"in an effort to seize and retain the initiative\" before the Russian presidential elections in March 2024. In the meantime, the ISW noted in an analysis, \"Ukrainian forces establish and consolidate defensive positions to conserve manpower and resources for future offensive efforts.\" Ukrainian forces have adopted a more defensive stance as circumstances dictate; a senior army general warned last week that front-line Ukrainian troops face artillery shortages and have scaled back some military operations because of a shortfall of foreign assistance.\nAid and politics\nAnother year of war in Europe has undoubtedly drained Western military resources and the political appetite to maintain massive amounts of military aid for Ukraine. Ongoing funding for Ukraine is far from secure in 2024 given the fact that the U.S. presidential election could herald a seismic change in the attitude toward and support for Kyiv. Specifically, all eyes are on former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, who cultivated close relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during his presidency. There are concerns that, given Trump's previous good relations with Moscow and \"America First\" policy, aid for Ukraine could be shelved rapidly. Defense analysts agree that much of the outlook for Ukraine is dependent on the outcome of the U.S. vote. \"I think it's important to understand the extent to which Ukraine is reliant on the U.S. right now, because it's quite significantly more reliant on the U.S. than it is on the EU,\" Sam Cranny-Evans, defense analyst at the Royal United Services Institute defense think tank, told CNBC. \"If the U.S. election goes in a way that is not in Ukraine's favor, coupled with the fact that the EU is not really stepping up to the plate \u2014 it's ammunition production is so far off what it should have been by now to give Ukraine a hope of surviving and a hope of victory \u2014 it's not a very cheery prediction for 2024.\"\nGood chemistry: President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands during a joint press conference after their summit on July 16, 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. Chris McGrath | Getty Images News | Getty Images\nRumblings of discontent over continuing Ukraine aid have been heard in some Republican quarters for months now, as well as in Eastern Europe. Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker told CNBC he believes American and EU aid packages for Ukraine will be approved come January, saying he believed this funding would tide Ukraine over for another year, militarily. Volker said that aid packages must include more advanced weaponry for Ukraine, however, like F-16 fighter jets which have been pledged by Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. Ukrainian pilots are beginning their training on the jets now but it could be a number of months before they're deployed in Ukraine. The U.S. is not providing F-16s to Ukraine but has authorized allies to provide their own jets. \"A couple of things ought to change,\" Volker told CNBC. \"We ought to lift restrictions on the weapons we're providing. We still don't provide the longest-range missiles and we still have not delivered any Western aircraft in Ukraine yet. Those things have to happen. And I think we have to try to give the Ukrainians more of a technological advantage,\" he noted.\nThe United States has said that it will begin flight training for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\nVolker believes that a Trump presidency might not be the catastrophe for Ukraine that is feared, but said it would make future funding uncertain. \"I doubt that even if Trump were elected that he would abandon support for Ukraine overall, because it would be a disaster for U.S. interests, and it would appear to be a failure. You'd have these images of Russians overrunning places, and brutality and so forth, so I don't think he wants that. But it's not clear exactly what he would do to try to end the war.\" For his part, Trump has said that he'd be able to resolve the Ukraine war \"in one day\" if he was reelected, saying he'd convince the leaders of Ukraine and Russia to make a deal.\nMore stalemate or negotiations?\nUkraine's Defense Ministry said last week that its main goal in 2024 is to boost its domestic defense industry in the face of uncertain future supplies from its Western allies. It has also changed conscription laws, foreseeing the need to bolster its forces, which are dwarfed in size by Russia's but are more highly trained and equipped. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that the military had asked for up to 500,000 additional conscripts but said he needed to hear \"more arguments\" to support the sensitive and costly proposal. With both Ukraine and Russia investing heavily in the war, it's unlikely there will be any negotiations to end the conflict or agree to a cease-fire. Defense analysts argue that neither side would want to go into negotiations unless they're in a position of strength and able to dictate terms. \"In the case of a Republican winning the presidential election next year, especially if that's Donald Trump, who seems to be the front-runner, and [if] funding is decreased substantially, then there will be increased pressure on Ukraine to negotiate,\" Mario Bikarski, a Europe and Russia analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC.\nA Ukrainian tank drives along the field on December 7, 2023 in Avdiivka, Ukraine.

{"title":"Kyle Larson Breaks Down His Sprint Car Series Journey and How He Partnered Up With Dale Earnhardt Jr.\u2019s Former Pupil","context":"## Kyle Larson Breaks Down His Sprint Car Series Journey and How He Partnered Up With Dale Earnhardt Jr.\u2019s Former Pupil\n\nDespite being a full-blown title contender in the NASCAR Cup Series, Kyle Larson manages to run a pretty successful Sprint Car Series. The Hendrick Motorsports driver is the co-owner of the High Limits Racing Sprint Car Series, along with four-time World of Outlaws Series champion and brother-in-law Brad Sweet. The venture by the two motorsports athletes has been a success so far, and recently, one of their races pulled an extraordinary crowd, which included a rather popular figure in the world of motorsports, Dale Earnhardt Jr.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nJunior was present at High Limit Racing\u2019s Commonwealth Clash at the Lernerville Speedway on Tuesday. He and Brad Sweet used to have a working relationship, as the latter used to be a development driver for JR Motorsports in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. As per Larson, it was the former Cup Series driver who had requested a visit to the event and had also urged Kyle Larson to take part in the race, which he obliged. The 49-year-old was quite happy with his experience after the event, but before the action started, he conducted an interview with Larson and Sweet, where he asked about the origins of the competition.\nKyle Larson explains his goal of \u201cadding pressure\u201d to his competition\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nLarson has always been a fan of sprint car racing, so it really is no surprise that he decided to start a competition involving sprint cars. What is surprising is how he gets the time to look after his Cup Series title run and the competition at the same time. It really is quite commendable that he has been able to turn High Limits Racing into the success that it is today.\nSpeaking about how everything started with him and Brad Sweet, Kyle Larson said, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve always talked about having a series that\u2019s solely based around me or whatever, and I didn\u2019t really want that, you know. I wanted to help out the other racers really, and you know I got to. Really, my eyes opened to starting this deal when I started racing the late model, and you know, FloRacing has their Tuesday night late model series and, you know, pays 20 some thousand to win every Tuesday, and I was like, Why wouldn\u2019t that work in sprint cars?\u201d\nWhile others in Larson\u2019s position might have felt that being the owner of a competition would be too challenging to focus on their racing career, the Hendrick Motorsports driver welcomed it with open arms. He saw a business opportunity ripe for the taking, took his shot, and hit the mark.\nThe series obviously helps out both Sweet and Larson financially, given the fan following it has garnered, but it is also quite profitable for the drivers and the teams. The winning driver, who in this case was David Gravel, wins $50,000, and with crowds so big, it helps out the teams with merchandise sales.\nEvents like these also help to keep these smaller race tracks across the country in good shape. If a track isn\u2019t used or taken care of for an extended period of time, it will start to wear out and eventually become completely unsuitable for any kind of racing unless it is taken apart and rebuilt. But one of Kyle Larson\u2019s reasons for doing what he does with the High Limits Racing Sprint Car Series is a lot simpler, and he revealed that goal to Dale Earnhardt Jr. at the Lernerville Speedway.\n\u201cCan\u2019t Have Everything You Want\u201d- Dale Earnhardt Jr. Ruthlessly Trashes Home Track as He Endorses Wild NASCAR Rumors\n\u201cI was hoping this would add pressure to the weekend shows to raise their purses as well so I think we\u2019ve seen a big step in that this year and I think it\u2019s gonna continue forward so, I would say so far it\u2019s been successful,\u201d he added. Kyle Larson had taken part in the Lernerville race on Tuesday, only a couple of days after a hectic race in Texas, and it seems like he had brought some of that form into the dirt track race because he made a slightly similar mistake.\nCup Series hopeful has Texas deja vu at Lernerville\nWith just nine laps to the checkered flag, Kyle Larson was leading the race and seemed to take the victory and earn himself $50,000 in his own competition. However, much like what happened in Texas, Larson lost control of his car as he was trying to defend the lead of the race from co-owner Brad Sweet.\nUnlike Texas, he did not DNF and managed to get his car back on track, but his chance to win had gone. The Cup Series HMS driver could only finish in eighth place. A racer as competitive as Larson would have liked a win, especially after what had happened the Sunday before, but it was a good day for him as the owner as well.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nThe 2021 Cup Series champion is in the prime of his career and has a lot of years left ahead of him in NASCAR, but when he decides to hang up his boots, he will hope that the High Limits Racing Sprint Cup Series achieves a high level of national popularity and he will not have to take himself out of the racing business.\nWatch This Story: Dale Earnhardt Jr Reveals the Immediate Regret After Entering Bristol\n\nThis article, authored by Nilavro Ghosh, was published by Essentially Sports on 2023-09-28 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":443}
{"title":"What USMNT can expect from Julian Nagelsmann, Germany in first match for new manager","context":"## What USMNT can expect from Julian Nagelsmann, Germany in first match for new manager\n\nWith the United States set to test themselves against one of Europe's most powerful sides, the opponents are entering a transitional phase as well.\nGermany are considered one of the preeminent national team programs in the world, but recent years have humbled Die Mannschaft. They have been eliminated in the group stage of two straight World Cup tournaments, an unthinkable slip in stature given they had never been bounced from any World Cup that early in history prior to 2018.\nWith Hansi Flick unable to steer the team to safer waters in Qatar, Julian Nagelsmann has taken over as new Germany head coach.\nAt just 36 years old, Nagelsmann is a rising star, having spent three successful seasons at Hoffenheim followed by two years at RB Leipzig, which catapulted him to the managerial post at Bayern Munich in 2021. He steered the Bavarian giants to the Bundesliga title in his first season, but he was sacked by the club in March of 2023 amidst a furious league title fight.\nNagelsmann's dismissal at Bayern Munich came as a shock to much of the European football landscape, as the club had performed exceptionally in the Champions League and was still very much in the title race, sitting just a point behind Dortmund. Now, with a chance for redemption at the helm of the national team, Nagelsmann will see his time begin with a friendly against the United States.\nMORE: A look at the 23-man squad for Gregg Berhalter as USMNT play Germany & Ghana\nGermany squad, players for USA friendly\nJulian Nagelsmann will be very familiar with much of the 26-man German national team squad, as five players hail from his former club Bayern Munich, including critical midfield duo Josh Kimmich and Leon Goretzka, who were instrumental in his setup at Allianz Arena.\nAlong the back, Nagelsmann has oddly selected five center-backs compared to just two natural full-backs in David Raum and Robin Gosens, both left-sided players, possibly indicating a desire to play a three-CB system, although it's hard to know for sure as Nagelsmann preferred a 4-2-3-1 for much of his club managerial career.\nOne of the center-backs present in the squad is Mats Hummels, who has not been called in since 2021 and dropped for the entirety of Hansi Flick's time in charge. This came at the expense of Hummels' Borussia Dortmund teammate Nico Schlotterbeck.\nFirst national team call-ups were handed to Kevin Behrens of Union Berlin, Chris Fuhrich of Stuttgart, and Robert Andrich of Bayer Leverkusen. There's a choice for Nagelsmann to make up front, as Niklas Fullkrug has been prolific in his short national team stint, but Thomas Muller is an experienced veteran who is still performing at a high level.\nInjuries for Nagelsmann to work around include Serge Gnabry who is out with a broken arm, and Timo Werner who has been touch and go at RB Leipzig with a back problem.\nGermany predicted starting lineup vs. USA (4-2-3-1): ter Stegen (GK) \u2014 Kimmich, Rudiger, Sule, Raum \u2014 Gundogan, Goretzka \u2014 Sane, Musiala, Brandt \u2014 Fullkrug.\nGermany second-choice lineup (4-2-3-1): Leno (GK) \u2014 Gross, Tah, Thiaw, Gosens \u2014 Andrich, Kimmich \u2014 Hoffman, Wirtz, Fuhrich \u2014 Muller.\nGerman national team squad for USA, Mexico friendlies\nPos Player Club Caps Goals GK Oliver Baumann Hoffenheim 0 0 GK Bernd Leno Fulham (ENG) 9 0 GK Marc-Andre ter Stegen Barcelona (SPA) 36 0 GK Kevin Trapp Eintracht Frankfurt 7 0 DEF Robin Gosens Union Berlin 18 2 DEF Mats Hummels Borussia Dortmund 76 5 DEF David Raum RB Leipzig 18 0 DEF Antonio Rudiger Real Madrid 62 2 DEF Niklas Sule Borussia Dortmund 47 1 DEF Jonathan Tah Bayer Leverkusen 17 0 DEF Malick Thiaw AC Milan (ITA) 2 0 MID Robert Andrich Bayer Leverkusen 0 0 MID Julian Brandt Borussia Dortmund 44 3 MID Chris Fuhrich VfB Stuttgart 0 0 MID Leon Goretzka Bayern Munich 53 14 MID Pascal Gross Brighton (ENG) 2 0 MID Ilkay Gundogan Barcelona (SPA) 69 17 MID Jonas Hoffman Bayer Leverkusen 22 4 MID Joshua Kimmich Bayern Munich 80 6 MID Jamal Musiala Bayern Munich 23 1 MID Leroy Sane Bayern Munich 55 13 MID Florian Wirtz Bayer Leverkusen 10 0 FWD Kevin Behrens Union Berlin 0 0 FWD Niklas Fullkrug Borussia Dortmund 9 7 FWD Kai Havertz Arsenal (ENG) 39 13 FWD Thomas Muller Bayern Munich 123 45\nJulian Nagelsmann tactics, style of play\nThrough his time at Bayern Munich, Julian Nagelsmann preferred a 4-2-3-1 formation with Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka holding down the lynchpin central midfield spots.\nHowever, as the 2022\/23 season progressed and results weren't as easy to come by, Nagelsmann switched to a 3-2-4-1 formation. This allowed him to deploy the likes of Alphonso Davies and Kingsley Coman very high up the pitch to provide width, while letting Jamal Musiala and Thomas Muller cook centrally behind a striker.\nThat 3-2-4-1 formation is flexible horizontally, as it allows one full-back to push high up the pitch while the other slots in along the back line, and thus sees the two central No. 10 players alternate pushing wide or pinching in to compensate.\nThis tactical setup is becoming popular with top-tier coaches across Europe, and has been used at various stages by the likes of Pep Guardiola, Stefano Pioli, Mikel Arteta, Edin Terzic, and many others.\nIn either setup, the forward line will shift horizontally to allow a midfield player to drive into space, and given options once halted to either play into the crowded forward line or release a bombing full-back to the off side, both of which can stretch or confuse an opponent's defensive unit.\nHaving spent time in the Red Bull system, Nagelsmann also deploys a complicated press that, like Gregg Berhalter, starts with the lone central striker. The goal is to force the opponent to play the ball into overload traps out wide, or if the opponent plays centrally, a defensive midfielder would step up at the base of a diamond (with two midfielders on the sides and the striker at the top) which would overwhelm an opposition midfield trio.\nHow will Germany play under Julian Nagelsmann?\nThe question, now, is how all this will translate to the German national team.\nLooking at Julian Nagelsmann's first squad of 26 players, the biggest question is which formation he will play. There are no natural right-backs on the roster, meaning he will either have to pidgeonhole a center-back (Antonio Rudiger or Niklas Sule) out wide, sacrifice Josh Kimmich's presence in midfield to move him back, or move Pascal Gross back. None of those are ideal options.\nWhether Nagelsmann deploys a 4-2-3-1 or a 3-2-4-1, the tactical approach will likely remain the same.\nGetting the best out of young superstar Jamal Musiala will be one of the most important aspects of Nagelsmann's tenure, as Musiala has blossomed into a world-class talent at Bayern Munich, but the 20-year-old has just one goal in 23 international caps to this point.\nNagelsmann will also look to introduce a few overlooked players, starting with Robert Andrich who could factor into the midfield setup as a traditional No. 6, especially as Ilkay Gundogan enters the twilight of his career. The new boss will also want to raise Kimmich's level of play back to old heights, as the ever-present Bayern star has seen his level drop in recent years for both club and country but remains a special talent.\nGermany criticized for travel schedule vs USA, Mexico\nThe DFB has taken significant flak from the German press for their travel to North America to play the United States and Mexico.\nThere's likely some form of superiority complex involved, with those following the German national team surely miffed that a European giant is traveling across the globe to meet CONCACAF sides with far thinner World Cup resumes. However, a closer look at their travel schedule does invite some questions as to how they've made use of the international break.\nMost notably, the Germany squad will return to Europe just a single day prior to Borussia Dortmund's first match out of the break, which sees BVB play Werder Bremen on Friday, October 20. Bayern Munich have their first game back against Mainz on Saturday, as does much of the Bundesliga.\n\"I don't know if I'd be interested in playing against Mexico in America before [the Euros hosted] in Germany,\" said Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel prior to the international break. \"I don't know if anyone can explain this in a way that I can understand. I don't know who decided it, but it has been decided.\n\"There is a difference between a busy schedule and everything away from home and in different time zones. This is at the end of the endurance. No coach in the world at this level will say otherwise.\"\n\"I don't understand the trip to the USA \u2014 for a variety of reasons,\" said former Germany international Lothar Matthaus to German outlet Bild back in the summer. \"I would have tried to create a good atmosphere in Germany before the Euros. That's why I would be in all 10 European Championship stadiums for the friendly matches and would have shown myself there once as a DFB selection. That can create a mood. But what do we want in the US at this point?\"\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Bonn, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-06 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":444}

Read our privacy notice Thanks for signing up to the\nFootball email {{ #verifyErrors }} {{ message }} {{ \/verifyErrors }} {{ ^verifyErrors }} Something went wrong. Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nCole Palmer is a man on the move, from Manchester City to Chelsea, from perennial substitute to pivotal starter, from England Under-21 player to, perhaps, a senior international. It has been a few months of swift change. He is trying to get used to new surroundings, having swapped south Manchester \u2013 in his native Wythenshawe \u2013 for the South.\n\u201cThe most annoying thing? The traffic, that\u2019s the biggest thing for me. Everything else I am enjoying. It is hotter than Manchester as well,\u201d he said. Certainly Palmer feels hot property right now, albeit while exhibiting a certain coolness. He was calm enough to score an injury-time penalty for his new club against his old on Sunday, completing a 4-4 draw, and cheeky enough to poke his head into a City huddle when they were lining up a free-kick, to the amusement of Erling Haaland.\nPerhaps it summed up Palmer\u2019s inability to feel intimidated by anything that he marked his goal against City with a shrug. There was no getting carried away. \u201cI spent 15 years at the club,\u201d he noted. \u201cI can\u2019t really go and celebrate how I would celebrate if I have scored a 95th-minute equaliser because it would have been disrespectful.\u201d\nThe alternative explanation is that Palmer has scored so many major goals in the last few months that this was merely another. He struck in the Community Shield and the European Super Cup for City, against Arsenal and Tottenham for Chelsea. That big-match temperament may equip him for tournament football in an England shirt. So, too, his nerveless penalty-taking.\nPalmer in training at St George\u2019s Park this week (PA)\nHe has, in effect, anointed himself as the spot-kick taker for the \u00a31bn team, taking the ball at Turf Moor to open his Chelsea account. \u201cIt was just an in-game thing, really,\u201d he said, with a matter-of-fact stance. \u201cOnce I scored at Burnley, I just thought: \u2018I\u2019ll take them\u2019.\u201d If penalties have been the English disease, Palmer has no hesitation when asked if he would be willing to come off the bench as a specialist from 12 yards for a shootout. \u201cYeah, I would be,\u201d he said.\nHe is not daunted by the last penalty he missed, as a substitute in the shootout when City lost the 2019 FA Youth Cup final to Liverpool. He can only remember failing from 12 yards on one other occasion, \u201cwhen I was dead, dead young versus [Manchester] United,\u201d and a willingness to take responsibility is similarly apparent in open play. \u201cI think I am a player who always wants the ball, anywhere, to try and help the team get out of a difficult situation or create a chance,\u201d he said.\nIf he has created an opportunity for himself with his country because of his excellence at Stamford Bridge, it had not formed part of his thinking. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking of an England call-up when I first went to Chelsea,\u201d he said.\nNor, indeed, was it on his agenda as a boy, when his mother banned him from playing in the garden. \u201cI was always breaking her pipes,\u201d he recalled. He has come a long way since then; particularly in 2023. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s been crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe changes have happened so fast. From winning the Euros to signing for Chelsea then getting signed up here.\u201d\nPalmer chats with Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka (The FA\/Getty)\nHis part in England Under-21s\u2019 European Championship win may have caught Gareth Southgate\u2019s eye. His immediate decision was whether he had done enough to impress Pep Guardiola. There had been interest in taking him on loan, from Brighton and Burnley and RB Leipzig. City decided that he could only leave on a permanent deal and Chelsea forked out \u00a342.5m. \u201cWho knows what would have happened if I had stayed?\u201d Palmer mused. \u201cMaybe I would have played more, maybe not. But I think the decision to go to Chelsea so far is paying off.\u201d\nThat is an understatement. And if there seemed a risk involved in swapping the stability of City for the seeming madhouse of Stamford Bridge, there was evidence of more cool-headed thinking from a 21-year-old. Chelsea have been manic buyers but he said: \u201cI did look at how many players were there but I don\u2019t think people realise how many players they actually got rid off, as well.\u201d\nThe departures of, among others, Mason Mount, Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Joao Felix, meant there could be opportunities in the attacking midfield positions. \u201cI looked at the squad and thought: \u2018If I go there and know what I can do then I\u2019ll have the chance of playing\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thankfully it\u2019s happened.\u201d If there seemed plenty of traffic in the queue for places in Southgate\u2019s attack, Palmer seems to have accelerated past several rivals. Now an England debut could follow in the next week.\n\nThis article, authored by Richard Jolly, was published by The Independent - Sports on 2023-11-15 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":445}
{"title":"David Benavidez vs. Demetrius Andrade fight predictions, odds, undercard, expert picks, start time, preview","context":"## David Benavidez vs. Demetrius Andrade fight predictions, odds, undercard, expert picks, start time, preview\n\nWhen two great fighters have been avoided by top opponents for so long, it inevitably makes sense for them to fight one another in order to get to the top.\nThat's the working theory being undertaken by former two-division champion Demetrius Andrade (32-0, 19 KOs), who has spent most of his career doing the unfruitful chasing of big names like Canelo Alvarez, Gennadiy Golovkin and Jermall Charlo.\nAndrade, 35, will finally get his shot at the super elite, and potential recognition among the pound-for-pound best in the sport, when he faces former two-time super middleweight titleholder David Benavidez (27-0, 23 KOs) on Saturday in a 168-pound clash at the Michelob Ultra Arena at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Showtime PPV, 8 p.m. ET).\n\"Fighters don't want to fight but I'm glad David has nowhere to go,\" Andrade told CBS Sports last month. \"It only makes sense to fight me.\"\nFresh off a resounding decision win over former champion Caleb Plant in their March PPV clash, the 26-year-old Benavidez, who was born in Arizona to parents of Mexican and Ecuadorian descent, has seemingly been hand-picked by boxing's foundational Mexican-American fan base as the eventual successor to Alvarez.\nBenavidez, like Andrade, is hoping a breakthrough victory against such a tricky opponent will be the final rung on the ladder that needs to be climbed before finally getting the call to challenge Alvarez for his four-pack of world titles in the division.\n\"To be honest, I don't know what that man is doing,\" Benavidez told \"Morning Kombat\" last month when asked about Alvarez. \"I feel like every time I say something, people say that I'm just looking for a payday. I have been the mandatory fighter for the past two years. I won the title eliminator first and then the WBC interim, which guarantees you a spot. So, the fact that the fight hasn't happened is really crazy to me.\n\"This man is just making it worse for himself because I am gaining so much experience. I'm getting very comfortable and I'm not going nowhere. As soon as I get in the ring with Canelo, all of those belts will come to me.\"\nCan't get enough boxing and MMA?

Subscribe to Morning Kombat with Luke Thomas and Brian Campbell for the best analysis and in-depth news.\nDon't let the ambitious hopes of both fighters and their collective lust for one day sharing the ring with boxing's biggest star as a means to suggest they are overlooking one another.\nBenavidez may have previously been his own biggest enemy throughout a career that saw him become the youngest champion at 20 in divisional history back in 2017 only for him to twice be stripped of his WBC title (once for a failed drug test for cocaine and a second time mid-pandemic for missing weight). But the maturity he has shown in recent years has been noteworthy, as was the performance he put together against Plant where Benavidez entered in top physical shape and simply wore his smaller opponent out over 12 rounds.\n\"I'm trying to prove to the world that I'm the best super middleweight on this planet,\" Benavidez said. \"I'm going to definitely show that because I have had a tremendous training camp. I have been working for three months already and have been getting some great rounds of sparring. And this is the final Showtime [pay-per-view] so we have to go out with a bang.\n\"These are the type of fights that interest me because Demetrius Andrade is a great fighter, no doubt about that. But I get to test my heart and test my spirit in front of everybody. I know that when people make me reach deep down, the best of myself comes out. So, we are looking forward to this.\"\nWhat makes this matchup so interesting is that Andrade, a 2008 U.S. Olympian from Rhode Island, is the kind of Swiss army knife boxer whose colorful personality has never been able to offset the fact that opponents have always looked at him as high risk and low reward.\nAndrade is a lengthy southpaw who relies on speed and guile to awkwardly navigate the center of the ring without paying for the real estate thanks to his elite defensive skills. But to try and suggest this fight has been a long-time coming for Andrade would be an insult to just how difficult his professional journey has been as it relates to trying to attract big-name opponents.\nAlthough Andrade has looked great earning respectable wins at 154 and 160 pounds against the likes of Vanes Martirosyan, Brian Rose, Willie Nelson, Jack Culcay and Maciej Sulecki, the big names have routinely avoided him. Throughout the process, Andrade has also found himself perpetually stuck in promotional Siberia and admits to having considered walking away multiple times due to frustration.\nAll of that appeared to change upon his signing with top advisor Al Haymon's Premier Boxing Champions in late 2022. What followed was a wide decision win over Demond Nicholson in his super middleweight debut in January, on the undercard of the Gervonta Davis-Hector Luis Garcia PPV card, which set up an opportunity to face Benavidez once it was clear Alvarez wouldn't be part of his 2023 plans.\n\"People have avoided me and have not wanted to fight [but] if you put the very best in front of me, I'm going to be the very best and I'm going to elevate,\" Andrade said. \"That's just what it is.\" I did throw my hands up at one point because of the situation that I was in. Clearly, it was not working out and there needed to be a separation here and a divorce. That has been pretty much what I have had to do in order to be in this position where I am today.\n\"This is more in my hands now. There are no obligations to a manager or a promoter. I do have a solid team that I trust and work with but nothing is on paper. Free at last, free at last. Thank ole, almighty God that I am free at last.\"\nAndrade might be more well known for his ability to hit and not get hit but that hasn't stopped him from declaring his willingness to defeat Benavidez under any means possible, even if that leads him to stand in front of Benavidez and trade.\nIt's a prospect that Benavidez would prefer, of course, although he is well prepared to do the chasing if he has to, similar to how he broke down Plant eight months ago.\n\"If he is going to give me a war then I'm looking forward to it because I'm a warrior and I can't wait to go in there,\" Benavidez said. \"The way I go into every fight is to think that every opponent is going to be the best that they can be. He's a slick boxer so I am expecting him to be at his best but this is what I have done for a long time. I love figuring guys out and I have hurt everyone that I have been in the ring with.\n\"I am the smarter fighter and I am the faster and hungrier fighter.\"\nAndrade said he doesn't expect Benavidez to be anything but in the best shape of his career this weekend but wants to make one thing clear to critics and\/or oddsmakers, including those who have installed him as a 3-1 underdog: He is not Caleb Plant.\n\"Listen, people definitely get up for Michael Jordan, you know? So, I would assume [Benavidez] would get up to fight myself,\" Andrade said. \"But I'm not Caleb Plant, in no way, shape or form. There are sayings out there that we fight a like because we both box but we do not fight alike. I get to put all of my own questions out there and get my answers, as well. It will be my time to get up there and let the A game of Demetrius Andrade come out. I haven't been able to bring that out [in a while]. This will be two cats fighting each other rather than one cat fighting a mouse.\"\nThe other fight of note on Saturday marks the return of WBC middleweight champion Jermall Charlo when he takes on Jose Benavidez Jr., the older brother of David Benavidez. Charlo has been out of action since June 2021 as he has dealt with out-of-ring issues with his family and his own mental health. Now, he looks to knock off the ring rust when he takes on Benavidez Jr. in a 10-round non-title bout. Benavidez Jr. picked up his first win in five years in August.\nLet's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event.\nBenavidez vs. Andrade fight card, odds\nDavid Benavidez -440 vs. Demetrius Andrade +335, super middleweight\nJermall Charlo -700 vs. Jose Benavidez Jr. +500, middleweight\n\nSubriel Matias -350 vs. Shohjahon Ergashev +275, super lightweight\n\nHector Luis Garcia -290 vs. Lamont Roach +235, super featherweight\nBenavidez vs. Andrade info\nDate: Nov. 25\n\nNov. 25 Location: Michelob Ultra Arena -- Las Vegas\n\nMichelob Ultra Arena -- Las Vegas Start time: 9 p.m. ET\n9 p.m. ET How to watch: Showtime PPV ($74.99)\nPrediction\nThose who have followed Andrade's career close enough will realize that he does have the skill set to pull off the upset. The biggest questions surround whether he can take the kind of pounding that Benavidez's downhill style unleashes, especially in the second half when \"The Mexican Monster\" seems to only get stronger.\nOne of the most underrated aspects of Benavidez's game is how deft he can be blocking or avoiding counter fire while operating at close range and trading punches. While most would expect Andrade to rely on his footwork in the first half, he will need to be certain that he's banking enough rounds before Benavidez's inevitable mid-fight adjustment kicks in and his pressure increases.\nAndrade's power is more of the accumulative kind over the course of rounds and not of the one-punch variety, which will make it difficult to dissuade Benavidez from coming forward. And that's the key to potentially bringing an edge with you to the ring against him because Benavidez's style is so fan and judge friendly as a come-forward attacker that it's difficult to bank close rounds against him because he's not only typically the busier fighter, he's also the one landing the majority of the power shots.\nIf Andrade can't hurt Benavidez or confuse him so thoroughly that it forces him away from his game plan, the best he can hope for is a moral victory of going the distance as Benavidez takes one massive step closer to the Alvarez bout which will likely define his pro career.\nPick: Benavidez via UD12\n\nThis article, authored by Brian Campbell, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-11-25 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":446}

It was the finest display of Mayfield's season and one of the best of his career. It's also one of the greatest showings in recent Lambeau Field history; according to ESPN Stats and Info, Mayfield is just the sixth opposing QB to toss for at least 350 yards and four touchdowns in a single game there.\nPer @ESPNStatsInfo, Baker Mayfield is the sixth visiting QB throw for 350 yards and four TDs at Lambeau Field all time.

He's hit the 300-yard mark on 12 separate occasions. He's also showcased inch-perfect precision, having completed at least 75% of his passes 10 other times.\nHe's rarely done so together, though. Nor has he provided such a viable scoring punch in those matchups: Sunday represents just the fourth time Mayfield has ever notched at least four touchdown throws.\nIt was just the sort of act that the Buccaneers were craving.

He turned the frozen tundra into a canvas, splattering all sorts of different colors on it while taking brief respites to admire his work. Mayfield finished the day with 381 passing yards, four passing scores and a 78.6% completion percentage.\nIn terms of individual days, it was a career one for Mayfield. He recorded the second-most single-game yard and second-most single-game touchdown totals of his professional career. And he did all this against a side fighting tooth and nail with Tampa for a playoff spot.\nBaker today:\n\n22\/28\n381 YDS\n4 TD (0 INT)\n\nHis 3rd career 4-TD, 0 INT game; first as a Buc. https:\/\/t.co\/Grah9iB0gV \u2014 StatMuse (@statmuse) December 17, 2023\nMayfield did the brunt of his damage against zone coverage, whipping arrows beyond the Packers secondary time and time again.

Mayfield looked composed in the pocket, letting loose as he slung the hazel-tinted chamber in all sorts of different directions. He hit that much-vaunted 158.3 perfect passer rating, becoming the first visiting quarterback to ever record such a mark at Lambeau. And he did so in style, whipping whistlers beyond Green Bay surveillance with a variety of targets. Five different Buccaneers wide receivers recorded at least 40 receiving yards on the day.\nChris Godwin was Mayfield's favorite battery mate. He caught 10 passes for 155 yards, by far his best showing of the year. But even when Godwin wasn't open, Mayfield got creative. Whether it was Mike Evans, Rachaad White, David Moore or even Ko Kieft, it seemed that whenever Mayfield wanted someone to get the ball, he got it to them without a hint of discomfort.\nPerfect day in Green Bay for Baker Mayfield.\n\n381 yards\n4 TDs\n0 INTs\n158.3 passer rating pic.twitter.com\/yjsAD23tNp \u2014 NFL (@NFL) December 17, 2023\nHe sparkled at the league's most hallowed ground.

{"title":"Israel\u2019s startup ecosystem: down but not out","context":"## Israel\u2019s startup ecosystem: down but not out\n\nThe world is still coming to terms with Hamas\u2019 deadly attacks on Israelis last weekend \u2014 and everything else that has unfolded so far in the aftermath, including the barrage of retaliation strikes on Gaza.\nUndoubtedly, the ramifications for the technology ecosystem pale in comparison to the human toll that the fighting is taking, on both sides. But when considering how the wider region will weather the destruction, and one day recover, it\u2019s an important industry to consider. Please also read here about how this is playing out for Palestinians in Gaza and beyond. And a below, we show how a look at how the situation is playing out in the startup ecosystem in Israel sheds light on its impact to the country as a whole.\nIn such a small country, just about everyone knows someone who was directly affected by the attacks, or someone involved in the subsequent defense and retaliation \u2014 and often all three.\nTechnology is, without question, a giant part of Israel\u2019s economy. In 2022, it contributed more than 18% of the country\u2019s GDP, the most of any single sector, according to the latest annual report from the Israel Innovation Authority.\nA total of 14% of Israeli citizens work in high tech, which in a country of just 9.2 million people works out to about 1.3 million. The active number of startups in the country is 9,000 (third-highest in the world after the Bay Area and NYC) and these startups have collectively, in the last five years, brought $95 billion into the country by way of venture capital.\nCombining the business development of startups with larger tech companies in the country \u2014 Intel, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and many others have operations in Israel \u2014 they collectively exported $71 billion last year, 48.3% of the total amount exported across all industries.\nUndoubtedly, those numbers are all going to be significantly lower this year, not least because the disruptions of this war are coming directly on the heels of a major protest movement.\nThe tech industry led opposition to the government\u2019s bid for judicial reform. Even before the fighting started, it was voting with its feet, and some companies and investors are already refusing to do business in the country with the prospect of the reforms getting pushed through. (That effort, in turn, has been brought to a halt: People on the two sides of that debate are now standing together for what they see as the significantly bigger fight and threat.)\nEven before last weekend\u2019s assault, startup investment in Israel was way down from the prior year. As TechCrunch\u2019s Anna Heim reported in July, \u201cWith a provisional tally of $3.2 billion for the first half of the year, funding activity in Israel dropped by 73% compared to the same period in 2022, IVC data shows.\u201d Other countries and regions have reported similar declines in their private-market capital flows this year.\nAs the war enters its sixth day, many people are being called up to the reserves, or volunteering to help in other ways. With the tech industry skewing younger, it\u2019s estimated that anywhere between 10% and 30% of all of Israel\u2019s tech employees are getting mobilized. More than 500 VCs have pledged their support of the efforts, too.\n\u201cIn the spirit of peace and unity, we encourage the global venture community to support and engage with Israeli startups, entrepreneurs, and investors as they navigate through these challenging times,\u201d the signatories wrote.\nTo better understand the on-the-ground situation for Israeli entrepreneurs, we spoke to a number of startup founders, PR people who work with startups and investors. The predominant response was that the businesses have to continue to operate as best they can, to help ensure the economic viability of the country.\nMaking sure everyone is OK\nThe founders and operators that we spoke to stressed after they ensured the safety of their teams, they have gingerly started to approach how to resume work. It\u2019s not a simple formula.\n\u201cCurrently, the emphasis is on finding a balance between supporting Israeli team members, some of whom want to keep working to clear their minds a little from what\u2019s happening, and some who cannot even think of working,\u201d Omer Davidi, CEO & co-founder, BeeHero, an Israeli agritech startup, told TechCrunch. \u201cThe priority is to focus on core company operations, especially in the short term, as we await a clearer understanding of the unfolding situation,\u201d Davidi said.\nYonatan Cohen, co-founder and CTO of Quantum Machines, says that the war is clearly affecting people, but they are returning to work. \u201cI can\u2019t deny that we all had trouble concentrating on work during the first few days of the war, \u201d he said. He points out that several of his employees have been called to active duty, but those who weren\u2019t are beginning to concentrate on work again in spite of the circumstances.\nShuly Galili, founding partner at venture capital firm UpWest, says the situation is complex, but companies are doing their best to navigate the challenges of operating in war conditions. \u201cPeople are being called up,\u201d she said, adding that there are some startup denizens, who are in the U.S. and are looking to get back and serve, but responses to the war extend beyond military service. \u201cAt this point many who are not called to serve are volunteering to provide equipment, medical supplies and food. Many technical developers are building tech to manage logistics and help communities deal with the aftermath of the situation,\u201d she added.\n\u201cThe call for reserve duty has affected a notable percentage of our workforce. I\u2019d estimate that at least 10% of our citizens have either enlisted or volunteered for the army,\u201d said Kfir ben Shooshan, founder and chairman of scooter startup Inokim. \u201cThis has inevitably strained many businesses,\u201d he said.\nLazer Cohen, whose company Concrete Media works with many startups, says people are contributing however they can, but the businesses need to keep running, too.\n\u201cLooking at our clients and my agency, 10-25% of Israeli team members have been called up to reserve duty,\u201d he said. Others on the team are helping by donating blood, hosting survivors of the attacks, packing supplies for soldiers or covering for a team member who was called up.\nThe economy matters, too\nWhile everyone is concerned about the war and its fallout, startup founders and their investors also recognize the importance of keeping these businesses going. For most Israeli startups, the customer base is global and for many, their go-to-market teams are in the U.S. and hence not directly affected by the war. The current situation may slow down product development but won\u2019t directly affect sales in the short run.\nWhile customers have been understanding for the most part, Cohen says that companies are working to continue operating under difficult conditions.\n\u201cAs we come out of the initial shock and horror of the attack, many tech workers and executives see it as their duty to keep the tech industry up and running. Technology is Israel\u2019s biggest export and the main engine of our economy and with a long and difficult war ahead, it\u2019s crucial that we keep working and innovating,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\nSharon Seeman, a partner at YL Ventures, says that it\u2019s important that companies maintain communication with customers. \u201cEnsuring the continuity of business operations is vital for Israeli startups in maintaining their customer relationships,\u201d she said.\nWhat might be a more tricky situation will be when startups come around to the inevitable cadence of their existence: raising money to scale their operations, and then doubling down and scaling those operations. Should the region and country continue to be at war, how will that play out with would-be startup investors and the LPs of startup investors?\nOurCrowd founder and CEO Jon Medved believes that in the long run, the Israeli startup ecosystem will remain reslient. \u201cThere is no doubt that in the long run \u2014 a year or more \u2014 Israel\u2019s tech ecosystem will emerge from this war, stronger, bigger, with more investment and returns for investors,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s tech ecosystem has well proven its resilience in past conflicts with Hamas. Israel is focused on deep tech, semiconductors, AI, mobility, fintech, cybersecurity, quantum, agtech, the cloud, devops, clean energy and so much more and as the future unrolls, these areas will grow in importance and Israel will continue to play a leading role in all of them.\u201d\nOren Yunger, managing partner at GGV, says his firm will do what it takes to make sure that the Israeli startups in his company\u2019s portfolio don\u2019t go bankrupt due to the war.\n\u201cI can say with absolute confidence \u2014 even if we don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take and who\u2019s going to be affected \u2014 I am 100% sure that none of our companies will go bust as a result from this moment in time,\u201d he said.\nMike Butcher, Frederic Lardinois, Anna Heim and Kyle Wiggers also contributed to this report.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-13 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":448}

{"title":"Adobe: Thanksgiving US online sales nudge up to $5.6B; Salesforce: $31.7B spent globally","context":"## Adobe: Thanksgiving US online sales nudge up to $5.6B; Salesforce: $31.7B spent globally\n\nThanksgiving Thursday, when stores in the U.S. are closed and many are spending time off work, has become the de facto start of the holiday shopping season both for those looking to get bargains online and for online retailers to kick off holiday sales deals to meet that demand. But if there is a message from this year\u2019s Thanksgiving sales, it is that consumers are holding steady, but don\u2019t hold your breath for a growth boom.\nAdobe Analytics said that people in the U.S. on Thursday spent $5.6 billion online, which it calculates at an increase of just 5.5% on last year.\nSalesforce, which also calculates sales based on data collected by its Commerce Cloud division, noted that globally, online sales reached $31.7 billion with its U.S. tally at $7.5 billion \u2014 both up only 1%. Salesforce\u2019s calculations of average order value were equally modest. Globally, average orders were up just 2% to $103 per \u201cbasket\u201d while in the U.S. they were up a paltry 1% to $119.\nMobile devices had a standout year: Adobe said that some $3.3 billion was spent over mobile devices on Thanksgiving, up 14% and an all-time record for the day.\nSalesforce added that online traffic in general to e-commerce sites, which includes browsing, was up too, but again only in single digits of 4% globally and 6% in the U.S.\nThe two are actively tracking sales for today, Black Friday, and for the whole of the \u201cCyber Weekend\u201d \u2014 which not only kicks off holiday shopping but has a particularly strong showing in online sales due to people traveling to be with family. As a bellwether for the rest of the holiday period \u2014 traditionally the biggest period for retail sales in the year \u2014 the flat sales speak to another tough year for online retailers.\nAdobe Analytics is predicting $37.2 billion in online spend for the full five days, up just 5.4% year on year and accounting for 16.8% of all holiday spend. And Black Friday will see $9.6 billion in sales, up roughly the same, 5.7%, versus figures last year. (The published figures in 2022 were $9.13 billion.) Salesforce has not provided forecasts.\nFor some context on today\u2019s Thanksgiving figures, last year\u2019s published figures from Adobe were $5.29 billion, which actually represents an increase of just under 4%. (It\u2019s likely Adobe Analytics readjusted its final figures for last year, which is why we see a higher percentage of growth.) Today\u2019s 5.5% rate is definitely an improvement on last year\u2019s 2.9%. But it\u2019s nothing compared to the years preceding COVID-19, such as 2017, where we were seeing growth of 18% or more.\nInflation is making an impact but not as much as the worry around consumer spending, said Adobe, which said that spending is being led actually by more discounts to encourage buying, rather than less buying of more expensive products. That leads one to wonder what kind of impact that\u2019s having on retailers\u2019 margins.\n\u201cCyber Week is off to a strong start with Thanksgiving driving a record $5.6 billion in online spend as consumers took advantage of strong discounts and continued their shopping plans, virtually,\u201d said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. \u201cMobile shopping hit an all-time high, as shoppers took to their smartphones to get the best deals during holiday gatherings, further solidifying mobile\u2019s growing importance in e-commerce.\u201d\nAdobe Analytics\u2019 figures are based, it says, on 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million SKUs and 18 product categories. Salesforce says it taps data from 1.5 billion consumers in its research. (Both companies work with a number of giant and smaller retailers, so they have the infrastructure to provide this kind of intel to these customers on an ongoing basis.)\nBreaking out some of the trends in how people are shopping:\n\u2014 Overall, desktop sales are still exceeding other kinds of screens when it comes to conversions and number of items purchased, but mobile is the standout device in the evening hours, when it accounted for a whopping 59% of all online sales (likely because people were using that time to socialize and buy on the sly).\n\u2014 More on mobile: Salesforce said that for the day, mobile accounted for 79% of all online traffic globally and 82% in the U.S., and that mobile wallets were really making a mark for reducing some of the buying friction on the smaller devices. Apple Pay saw transactions up by 47% compared to 44% up for all mobile wallets overall. Social on mobile \u2014 think Instagram links, TikTok and Snapchat \u2014 has become an influencer in itself. These collectively accounted for 13% of all traffic referrals to sites. Notably, they are not where the purchases are being made for the most part, though.\n\u201cMobile traffic and sales are soaring as people are on the go once again this holiday weekend,\u201d said Salesforce VP and GM, Retail, Rob Garf, in a statement. \u201cConsumers are embracing mobile wallets to break down friction between discovering on social and purchasing on mobile.\u201d\n\u2014 Retailers are really pushing out discounts to get people more willing to spend money this year. Both Adobe and Salesforce said in the U.S. discounts were up by about 28%. Categories that saw dramatic markdowns included toys, electronics and computers, per Adobe\u2019s figures; respectively these saw sales up by 182% and 113% over last month.\n\u2014 Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) remains a popular option for paying upfront. BNPL drove $390 million in online spend, Adobe said, up 7.5% on last year.\nWe\u2019ll update with more data later, and with Black Friday figures as they start to emerge.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-24 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":450}
{"title":"\u2018Biggest win of my career\u2019: De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final","context":"## \u2018Biggest win of my career\u2019: De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final\n\nThe second of Sinner\u2019s Djokovic victories came in Italy\u2019s impressive Davis Cup semi-final triumph over Serbia, after saving three consecutive match points on serve, before besting the world No.1 again in the doubles. World No.4 Sinner, coached by Australia\u2019s Darren Cahill, is the first player to topple Djokovic twice in the same season since Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev in 2019. Italian teammates Lorenzo Sonego and Jannik Sinner will face Australia in the Davis Cup final. Credit: Getty However, if Popyrin can get the job done in the No.2 singles then Australia will, at minimum, reach the doubles with a live chance, and a good one, with 2022 Wimbledon champions Max Purcell and Matt Ebden to be unleashed. The query is whether Italian captain Filippo Volandri will turn to Lorenzo Musetti, who battled a leg issue at the end of his three-set loss to Serbia\u2019s Miomir Kecmanovic, or one of Lorenzo Sonego or Matteo Arnaldi.\nPopyrin won his only ATP Tour clash with Musetti \u2013 who has been as high as No.15 in the world \u2013 in a tight two-setter at last year\u2019s Miami Masters, but the emerging Italian claimed three of their four showdowns at the next level down. He is yet to play against Sonego, who Arthurs expects to play. \u201cI\u2019m assuming they will back in Popyrin because he played pretty well a couple of nights ago, and with his firepower \u2013 he\u2019s probably the key to the tie,\u201d Arthurs said. \u201cHe\u2019s showing all the signs of becoming a top-25 player in the next couple of years. His junior career suggested he was going to be a very good player, and it\u2019s unusual for someone to win the junior French Open and not go on to something big. Alexei Popyrin celebrates with Australian captain Lleyton Hewitt after his Davis Cup win. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThese moments can be a big springboard for someone like Alexei. He\u2019s a confidence player, and this is a very big moment \u2013 whoever he plays, Musetti or Sonego. But he\u2019s got to go out and embrace the moment, and he\u2019s the type of player who will enjoy it.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to give de Minaur a chance with his fighting abilities, but the way Sinner has played the last six months, you\u2019d have to say Sinner is the favourite.\u201d Loading Hewitt animatedly embraced Popyrin after his straight-sets victory over 171st-ranked Finn Otto Virtanen, but Australia\u2019s Davis Cup captain would be even more thrilled if he could repeat the dose against Italy. Australia could also turn to an alternative No.2 singles option, with Jordan Thompson and Purcell waiting in the wings. \u201cIt\u2019s everybody\u2019s dream to play for their country,\u201d Popyrin said. \u201cI looked up to Lleyton, looked up to all the older Aussie legends. To be able to put on the green and gold, to be able to go out there and play for your country, no matter the format, if it\u2019s this Davis Cup or the old Davis Cup, you give your all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nerves, it\u2019s pressure \u2013 you\u2019re playing for everybody back home. It\u2019s something that nothing will ever compare to ... it really was the biggest moment of my career to get the first live rubber win, to get one foot into the final. It was something that I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Loading Australia, who lost last year\u2019s final to Canada, has enjoyed a soft run on paper to this year\u2019s decider, eliminating the Czech Republic and Finland \u2013 with neither country boasting a top-30 singles player \u2013 but will have earned their 29th Davis Cup title if they account for Italy. Canada defeated Italy in the Davis Cup round-robin matches in September, but bowed out to Finland in the knockout stage without Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov, who have both battled injury and form. The final is due to start at 2am AEDT on Monday and will be broadcast on 9GEM.\nSinner ends Djoker\u2019s Davis Cup dream Novak Djokovic\u2019s dream of capping his great season by blasting Serbia past Australia in the Davis Cup final was blown up by Jannik Sinner\u2019s extraordinary double triumph over the world No.1. Instead, in the Davis Cup final in Malaga, Australia will face an Italy team running hot on the heroics of their golden boy Sinner, who beat Djokovic in both the singles and the doubles in the space of five exhilarating hours in their semi-final on Saturday (Sunday AEDT). Jannik Sinner saved three match points before going on to beat Novak Djokovic. Credit: Getty Images In one of the great Davis Cup rubbers, Djokovic had held three match points against Sinner and was on the verge of a completing a relatively workaday 2-0 victory for the Serbs.\nBut for only the fourth time in his unparalleled career, Djokovic was beaten from match-point up as Sinner roared back to complete his second victory over the master in just 12 days, winning 6-2, 2-6, 7-5. The 22-year-old Sinner, by now an irresistible force, then re-emerged to team up with Lorenzo Sonego and spray massive forehand winners around liberally as they outplayed a by now weary-looking Djokovic and Miomir Kecmanovic 6-3, 6-4. Djokovic had three match points in the singles rubber. Credit: Getty Images It was a crushing end to Djokovic\u2019s hopes of ending his triumphant season, which has featured three grand slam victories and an ATP finals showdown victory over Sinner just six days ago, with a second Davis Cup title. After telling fans to \u201cshut up\u201d earlier in the week, he again got irritated with the crowd in the doubles, pretending to be the conductor to the Italian fans\u2019 deafening chorus, but though he may be the greatest player who ever picked up a racquet, doubles looks an alien game to him.\nHis serve was broken in the first set and his court positioning left a big hole for Sinner to blast his forehand through the world No.1 and Kecmanovic, who had earlier worn down Lorenzo Musetti 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1 in the tie\u2019s opening singles. The tie, though, will forever be remembered for Sinner\u2019s comeback triumph in their third brilliant singles duel in less than a fortnight. This time, the Sinner of the Turin group stages re-emerged, the young titan reprising his victory of 12 days ago when he became the only man since Djokovic\u2019s Wimbledon final loss to Carlos Alcaraz to defeat the 24-time grand slam champion. Here he did something even more astonishing when, after soaking up immense pressure throughout the deciding set, he stared at 0-40 on his serve at 4-5. Yet the 22-year-old proved absolutely nerveless, firing down an ace to save the third of the three match points, and then immediately turning the tables by breaking Djokovic in the very next game amid wild Italian celebrations in the stands at the Palacio de deportes Martin Carpena.\nSinner then served out for a famous win, ending Djokovic\u2019s cherished unbeaten 21-singles winning streak in the Davis Cup and becoming the first man since 2019 to beat the Serb in singles twice in the same year. The drama between the two rivals wasn\u2019t over, as the two teams inevitably both drafted in their top singles players into the doubles decider. Sinner was again magnificent and still looking ominously fresh after more than four hours on court, with Djokovic\u2019s weak backhand into the net off the Italian\u2019s second serve in the doubles on match point seeming to sum up his disappointment. The beneficiaries of all this? Lleyton Hewitt\u2019s Australian side, who were happily enjoying a day\u2019s rest at their team hotel further down the Costa del Sol, watching the drama unfold on TV.\nWhile the Italy tie didn\u2019t finish until 8.15pm after a noon start, Alex de Minaur and co should be fresh for combat in Sunday afternoon\u2019s (Monday AEDT) final as they seek to lift the Davis Cup for the first time in 20 years. AAP De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final Lleyton Hewitt has declared his close-knit tennis band of brothers will give it \u201ca hell of a shake\u201d to bring back the Davis Cup to Australia after they roared into another final in Malaga. Following their 2-0 victory over Finland in Friday\u2019s semi-final, executed superbly without a dropped set in singles wins for Alexei Popyrin and Alex de Minaur, team captain Hewitt said he couldn\u2019t be prouder of their achievement in making back-to-back finals.\nAnd even though they\u2019ll be facing either a Serbian side led by world No.1 Novak Djokovic or an Italian team inspired by young superstar Jannik Sinner in Sunday\u2019s (Monday AEDT) final, the inspirational de Minaur was adamant: \u201cNo one really wants to play us.\u201d He delivered once more for Australia, taking an 11th victory in his last 13 cup singles matches, sealing Friday\u2019s (Saturday AEDT) win by defeating Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4, 6-3. Alex de Minaur stretches to return the ball against Finland\u2019s Emil Ruusuvuori. Credit: AP It had followed a superb win from teammate Popyrin, who defied jangling nerves to earn a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 victory over Otto Virtanen. It meant the Australians\u2019 crack doubles team of Max Purcell and Matt Ebden weren\u2019t even needed.\nIt will be Australia\u2019s 49th appearance in the Davis Cup final, as they seek the trophy for the 29th t28-time champions Australia, in a 49th final, seek a first win in the World Cup of men\u2019s tennis in 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019re a very solid squad, a lot of depth in every single position, and if we can get ourselves to a deciding doubles, we\u2019ve got an unbelievable pairing as well,\u201d de Minaur said. \u201cSo we singles guys have just got do our best to try and get a win and let the doubles guys do the job. \u201cHopefully we can go one better this year,\u201d he added, recalling the 2-0 defeat by Canada in 2022. De Minaur had been the hero on Wednesday, pulling out an extraordinary comeback win over Jiri Lehecka with Australia on the verge of defeat in their quarter-final with the Czech Republic.\nBut he was happy to pass the laurels to Popyrin, a late squad replacement who\u2019d been asked to take on the troublesome \u201csecond singles\u201d role by Hewitt. Loading \u201cAlexei hasn\u2019t played for Australia in a very long time [two years], had a massive match today against a very high-quality opponent and dug super deep,\u201d said de Minaur. Popyrin managed to deliver a rock solid game, making only 11 unforced errors to his erratic opponent\u2019s 25, to prevail in just under an hour-and-a-half. \u201cIt was probably the biggest win of my career,\u201d he admitted. \u201cTo win a match that means so much to us, it\u2019s an honour and something I\u2019ll never forget. Nothing compares to this.\n\u201cI thought I was ready but when I came out and heard the two sets of fans chanting so hard, but it was nerves that I\u2019ve never experienced before.\u201d Loading It wasn\u2019t easy. The pressure was on with Thanasi Kokkinakis, the injured teammate he\u2019d replaced, Purcell and Jordan Thompson having all lost opening singles ties in this year\u2019s competition, and Popyrin struggled too against a big-hitting 22-year-old going for broke. But after repelling a set point in the opening stanza, Popyrin\u2019s solidity in comparison to his increasingly erratic opponent helped silence a noisy contingent of Finnish fans, who\u2019d been hoping to cheer their underdogs to a first-ever final. De Minaur, cheered on by his excited mum, then didn\u2019t need similar heroics to Wednesday\u2019s as he overcame the loss of the first two games.\n\nThis article, authored by Ian Chadband, was published by The Age on 2023-11-24 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":451}
{"title":"A field guide to the vampire authors who were probably vampires","context":"## A field guide to the vampire authors who were probably vampires\n\nVampire fiction has a long and distinguished pedigree in English. From the moment that Robert Southey introduced the British Isles to the concept of the coffin-sleeping undead at the turn of the 19th century, the authors of vampiric stories have mirrored the changing face of the society that reads them.\nWe're spending a week diving deep into the stories behind your favorite vampires. Who says we only get to celebrate vampires at Halloween?\nAnd yet, scholars have largely turned a blind eye to one lingering question: Which of these authors were, themselves, nosferatu? Was night-stalking Lord Byron secretly a daywalker? Could it be that Anne Rice\u2019s innate understanding of deathless sexiness is itself a result of her fellowship in the camp of the undead?\nUntil we understand which writers have been secretly propagandizing for Dracular overlords, our understanding of the place of vampires in anglophone culture will never be fully complete. So in the interest of bettering the cause of human understanding and avoidance of unwilling resurrection, we present the following field guide to secretly vampiric authors, past and present.\nJohn William Polidori\nBest-known vampire book: The Vampyre (1819)\nWhile the concept of vampires goes back at least as far as Balkan folktales from the middle ages or earlier, its history in the English-speaking world began in earnest with Dr. John William Polidori\u2019s novel The Vampyre at the turn of the 19th century. The book itself has as high-class an origin as any bloodsucker book could ask for, having been born at a Swiss chalet, in the same spooky story contest where Mary Shelley hatched the idea for Frankenstein. The contest entry for another participant, Lord Byron, was the tale of an aristocratic Englishman who is secretly an ancient, unkillable force of evil. Being too lazy to actually write the story himself, Byron passed along the idea to his personal physician and party guest, Polidori, who spun it out into his novel three years later.\nPolidori had always had an adorably puppy dog-ish devotion to Byron \u2014 that mercurial, temperamental, but undeniably sexy man of the late-night hours. So it\u2019s not surprising to see the doctor\u2019s depiction of the book\u2019s vampiric main character, Lord Ruthven, take on a certain erotic charge. Ruthven is described as cruelly sadistic, mockingly contemptuous of others, yet desperately desired by those around him for reasons even they can\u2019t entirely explain.\nHe is, in other words, a pathetically obvious stand-in for Byron himself, and Polidori\u2019s almost unwilling attraction to his questionable friend marks him out as a classic human thrall of an undead overlord.\nVerdict: Not a vampire, but Byron\u2026 vampire all the way\nBram Stoker\nBest-known vampire book: Dracula (1897)\nThe real breakthrough moment for vampires in the English-speaking world came just before the turn of the 20th century with the publication of Bram Stoker\u2019s appropriately immortal novel Dracula. Stoker\u2019s story of a Transylvanian count who takes residence in the U.K. in order to launch a centuries-old plan of vampiric conquest and enslavement became the source of pastiches, spinoffs, and cliches almost from the moment it arrived. As a result, its influence codified many of the basic elements of vampire storytelling for the next half-century or more: the foreign, undead aristocrat whose cosmopolitan charm and suave allure stood in for English fears and paranoias about the allure of other nations and races; the bloodsucking conversion process (targeted, invariably, against either women or the more effeminate among the male set) that reads alarmingly like seduction; the tricks and traps of the vampire hunters that range from wooden stakes to garlic to sunlight to good old simple beheadings.\nStoker\u2019s own biography is almost the inverse of his noble-born immortal count, but it\u2019s still fittingly enigmatic for the writer of the seminal work of undead fiction. Born to a middle-class Protestant Irish family in the 1840s, Stoker\u2019s life grew progressively more bizarre: Among other things, he took a keen interest in the occult studies of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as well as the history and practices of the Freemasons. Cultivating a public reputation? Seeking inspiration for a never-materialized new hit story? Perhaps. Then again, it\u2019s just possible that somewhere along the way, Stoker had acquired a membership to the most elite secret society of all.\nVerdict: Vampire\nStephen King\nBest-known vampire book: \u2019Salem\u2019s Lot (1975)\n\u2019Salem\u2019s Lot, Stephen King\u2019s second published book after the breakout success of 1974\u2019s Carrie, concerns (obviously) a writer who returns to his childhood hometown in (obviously) rural Maine, only to discover gradually but gruesomely that the entire society is in thrall to the undead.\nIf the vampire stories of the Victorian era had used their monstrous antagonists as allegories for the deepest fears of the fading 19th century, King\u2019s novel was an encapsulation of post-Watergate suspicions that government corruption had infected all levels of the community. But just as notable as King\u2019s modernizing of the vampire novel is his decided and inarguable resemblance to creature of the night himself.\nIn addition to famously dwelling in the least accessible reaches of rural New England, and maintaining a schedule, lifestyle, and an ability to defy death that would make Rasputin blush (dude survived a direct hit from a car, just for starters), King has also been frozen in an ageless state that could fairly be described as \u201cnon-specifically ancient\u201d throughout his career. He\u2019s not only a vampire, but it could be reasonably argued that he\u2019s not even trying very hard to hide it. Still, given King\u2019s recent and high-profile stances against corporate power and in favor of trans rights, it has to be admitted that he makes a strong case for vampire kind.\nVerdict: Vampire (complimentary)\nAnne Rice\nBest-known vampire books: The Vampire Chronicles series (1976-2018)\nEver since the Victorian era, vampires in fiction have stood in for all the sexual urges, temptations, and repressed fears burbling below the surface of a repressive society. But until the late 20th century, subtext is where those messages stayed buried: charged little winks to audiences that may have led to genre success, but could never actually be stated out loud by any character on the page.\nIt would take until the 1970s for those themes to finally take center stage. Not coincidentally, it would take a woman to do it. When Anne Rice\u2019s Interview with the Vampire reached bookshelves in 1976, it was a watershed moment for vampire novels \u2014 the first time a mainstream book had prominently featured vampires that were gay, campy, and unapologetically fabulous.\nFor that alone, you might mistake Rice for a classic vampire-infected propagandist for the cause, but the case is a little muddier than that. Rice had a famously ambivalent relationship with the Catholicism of her youth, first turning away from it in favor of sexy gothic monster books, then embracing it in the early 2000s to pen a series of Christ-themed religious fiction, then finally rejecting the Church once more over its conservative social positions (\u201cIt\u2019s simply impossible for me to \u2018belong\u2019 to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group,\u201d she wrote on her Facebook page at the time). Even so, religious flirtation is canonically one of the few things a vampire can\u2019t tolerate even in small doses, so this is one case in which the jury is no longer out.\nVerdict: Not a vampire\nLaurell K. Hamilton\nBest-known vampire books: Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series (1993-present)\nLaurell K. Hamilton\u2019s vampire novels are like the final evolution of an undead Pok\u00e9mon. Where Anne Rice made vampires sexy but still took pains to remind readers that they were fundamentally the stuff of nightmares, Hamilton\u2019s Anita Blake series is more like the merrily obscene aesthetic of a 1970s grindhouse flick. Her characters bash, slaughter, and jump one another\u2019s bones (animated or otherwise), but it\u2019s all in good fun. With her books, the sexy and violent vampire has reached a Looney Tunes stage of madcap romp, and audiences can\u2019t get enough of it.\nBut does that make Hamilton herself a vampire? I\u2019d argue to the contrary. Nothing serves the vampire cause less than undermining the air of looming menace that they\u2019ve been cultivating since the 15th century. Vlad the Impaler worked for that nickname, dammit, and the last thing they need is for an airport novel to make a stake through the heart look fun. No, Laurell K. Hamilton isn\u2019t among the denizens of the undead. She\u2019s the one thing they\u2019ve come to fear this millennium: a good punchline.\nVerdict: Not a vampire\nTaika Waititi\nBest-known vampire work: What We Do in the Shadows (2014, 2019-present)\nWhile What We Do in the Shadows isn\u2019t actually a work of prose fiction, and Waititi isn\u2019t actually an author, who is to say what constitutes true literature, anyway? Regardless, What We Do in the Shadows, which Waititi co-created along with his fellow New Zealander Jemaine Clement (the two wrote and directed the original 2014 movie) is surely the most culturally pervasive piece of vampire-themed fiction to reach mass audiences over the past few years. Just as importantly, it marks the necessary next step in the inexorable movement of vampiric lore from creeping terror to sexy camp to outright comedy with only the faintest twist of terror to remind us of its origins. Two centuries after its English-language birth, the vampire genre has at last been metaphorically defanged. We humans have taken its blood and sucked it dry for our amusement.\nAnd what can we say about Taika Waititi? Here is a director and writer who started out charmingly likable, beloved by both audiences and critics; he was happily invited into our homes; rapidly wore out his welcome; and, almost before we knew what had happened, he has curdled into an odorous pestilence we couldn\u2019t seem to be rid of (when you lose the Chris Hemsworth demographic, you know you\u2019re in trouble). And yet, here we are, coming back for more, year after year, drawn to him by a force we are powerless to explain \u2014 when it comes to Our Flag Means Death, we are all Renfields. And what, after all, could serve the vampire cause better than to trick us into thinking the threat had passed? My friends, we haven\u2019t just found a vampire. We have found their king.\nVerdict: Dracula\n\nThis article, authored by Zach Rabiroff, was published by Polygon on 2023-11-09 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":452}
{"title":"The best surprise vampires in things you did not expect to see vampires","context":"## The best surprise vampires in things you did not expect to see vampires\n\nWe're spending a week diving deep into the stories behind your favorite vampires. Who says we only get to celebrate vampires at Halloween?\nYou know what\u2019s cooler than a vampire story? A story that\u2019s not a vampire story, but surprise \u2014 it has vampires.\nThe surprise vampire is a rich tradition, unfolding across many different media intended for all kinds of audiences. Sometimes it is a prominent part of a story that\u2019s made richer for the unexpected presence of a bloodsucker.\nSometimes it is subtle, an easily missable detail that rewards only the most observant. In the best version, the vampires are always there, in the background, waiting for you to discover them \u2014 just like in real life.\nHere are some of our favorite examples.\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3: Astarion\nIf Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 was your introduction to the Forgotten Realms of Dungeons & Dragons, you might be shocked to find out about a lot of stuff that\u2019s tucked away in the world\u2019s most famous tabletop role-playing game. The great thing about Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is how it centers all that weird stuff \u2014 like Astarion, a haughty elf that you can either play as or recruit to your party very early on, and guess what? He\u2019s a vampire! And dealing with his vampirism is a huge part of the game, should that be something you want to do.\nThe Matrix Reloaded: The Merovingian\u2019s Henchmen\nLike a lot of ideas in the Matrix movies, a seemingly throwaway line leads to a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it scene with wild implications for everything you\u2019re looking at. In The Matrix, The Oracle tells Neo that things that go bump in the night are in fact real, the result of a program misbehaving, an error in the virtual world of The Matrix. In The Matrix Reloaded, we meet some of those misbehaving programs in the form of the Merovingian\u2019s henchmen. The Merovingian\u2019s wife, Persephone, notes that they are very hard to kill \u2014 before she kills one of them with silver bullets. While the twin ghosts get significantly more screen time in Reloaded, the world of the films gets much more interesting when you realize that they are just two members of a whole assortment of ghoulies, and a superhuman kung fu god isn\u2019t the only cool thing a character can be in these movies.\nThe Elder Scrolls: Everywhere\nThe fantasy of the Elder Scrolls games often presents as very straightforward. With the exception of Morrowind, each of the games starts out as a pretty up-the-middle fantasy setting, with nary a twist of any kind. But a big reason Elder Scrolls games have an enduring fan base is down to the fact that beneath the surface, there is always weird shit to find. Like vampires! And in keeping with the open-ended role-playing philosophy the series espouses, you can also become a vampire \u2014 it kicks ass.\nPreacher: Cassidy\nPreacher, the comic book by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon \u2014 and its subsequent TV adaptation from Sam Catlin, Evan Goldberg, and Seth Rogen \u2014 starts with the basic assumption that God is real, and has walked out on the job. A lot of things are fair game at that point, namely angels, demons, and the like, but it\u2019s still a shock when you meet Cassidy. A brawling, hard-drinking Irishman that\u2019s already a load of fun when you meet him, Cassidy shoots up the power rankings when he sinks his teeth into a poor sap, because he\u2019s a vampire.\nSpider-Man: The Animated Series: Morbius\nHands down the ballsiest Spidey villain to adapt in a cartoon for children that censors wouldn\u2019t even let use the words \u201csinister\u201d or \u201ckill,\u201d Morbius \u2014 the Living Vampire \u2014 frankly had no business being in a Saturday morning lineup. The clever folks behind Spider-Man got around the strict content standards of their network with a loophole that might be even creepier than how vampires normally feed: by giving him little suckers on the palms of his hands that drain victims of \u201cplasma.\u201d\nHilariously, a creative application of vampirism would be how the show would later adapt another villain normally too violent for kids TV: Carnage, a serial killing symbiote who now \u201cdrained\u201d his victims\u2019 \u201clife force\u201d instead of cutting them to bits.\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse: Miguel O\u2019Hara\nMiguel O\u2019Hara, the Spider-Man of 2099, is one of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u2019s big enigmas. Comics readers will know plenty about his whole deal, but the movie doesn\u2019t really explain much \u2014 except for a brief scene where he\u2019s shown to have fangs, and an offhand reference that he is kind of a vampire? Sure, he\u2019s a jerk, but he\u2019s still kind of cool. It\u2019s kind of hard not to be cool when you\u2019re a vampire. That\u2019s kind of the whole quandary with vampires as a metaphor.\nAdventure Time: Marceline the Vampire Queen\nFor 11 episodes, Adventure Time was a show with lots of weird shit, but no vampires. Then \u201cEvicted!\u201d introduced Marceline the Vampire Queen, and the show changed forever. Marceline was key to what the show would go on to do so well: use its goofy sensibilities to tackle existentially dark and frightening things quite seriously without losing its edge, and play with familiar tropes to create a fantasy like no other. Now with vampires!\nSesame Street: The Count\nI don\u2019t really know why there\u2019s a vampire on Sesame Street. I love him, though.\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Vamp\nThe Metal Gear Solid games are kings of the nonchalant narrative curveball. It\u2019s a series that takes great care to ground itself in near-future militaristic realism and hard sci-fi, only to suddenly introduce a man made of bees and a cyborg ninja. Vamp is one of those curveballs, the member of a rogue special forces unit with a superhuman resistance to injury, the ability to run on water, and a taste for blood \u2014 with an eerie origin story for that hunger, to boot.\nThe Bone Clocks: The Anchorites\nDavid Mitchell loves to write books that start as one thing then end up as another. But he writes them knowing that people know he\u2019s famous for this, so he often turns these books into other things still. It\u2019s a real trip. The Bone Clocks, then, is a book about a psychic girl who gets into a bit of a pickle, only to learn about vampiric ghosts called Anchorites, who achieve immortality by murdering others. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t spoil the book for you. I just thought you should know about the vampires.\n\nThis article, authored by Joshua Rivera, was published by Polygon on 2023-11-15 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":453}
{"title":"The best gifts to level up a home theater","context":"## The best gifts to level up a home theater\n\nIf you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement .\nThe call of the couch gets stronger every year as new gadgets, movies, TV shows, and streaming services launch. As such, you may find yourself considering how to curate a space to watch coveted new (and old) releases that doesn\u2019t involve leaving the house, or paying for tickets and reserved seating. You\u2019ll still have to spend money on snacks, but not nearly as much.\nA high-quality home cinema setup summons the most compelling parts of the silver screen into your own living room. Whatever it is you want to watch, upgrading your home theater hardware and related accessories can enhance your viewing experience.\nLG C3 OLED TV\nA TV is the beating heart of the home theater experience, and the LG C3 is a compelling sell for cinephiles who want the best possible video quality. The C2\u2019s 65-inch OLED screen provides unparalleled contrast, and it has a 120 Hz refresh rate, which is great for making the most of gaming at a high frame rate via the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Like other high-end TVs, the C3 features Filmmaker Mode, which adjusts the picture and motion settings to display your favorite flicks as their director intended them to be seen.\nLG Sound Bar C (SC9)\nFinding the right soundbar to pair with your fancy TV can be a bit of a challenge. First, you need to decide what kind of features you want, then land on one that has a design that you like. Well, if you opted for the LG C3 OLED, you might as well get the soundbar that LG made to be the perfect companion in both regards. The SC9 soundbar and wireless subwoofer bolster the C3\u2019s phenomenal picture quality with amazing audio, including Dolby Atmos support. When purchased through LG\u2019s website, you\u2019ll get a mounting bracket to fasten the soundbar to your wall \u2014 perfect if you\u2019ve mounted your television, too.\nDisney Bundle Trio\nThe chances are good that you\u2019ve already found yourself aboard the streaming service carousel, juggling options such as Paramount Plus, Netflix, Max, and maybe more. If you want to slim down without losing out on great content, you can\u2019t do much better than the Disney Bundle Trio. Disney Plus\u2019 impressive catalog includes plenty of original content (and a bucketload of Marvel and Star Wars), but this deal gives you all that along with Hulu and ESPN, providing hours of sitcoms and sports.\nCrunchyroll\nCrunchyroll is the best streaming service for anime lovers or newcomers, with classics like JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure appearing alongside modern behemoths such as Jujutsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, and Spy x Family. You\u2019ll not only have access to an impressive catalog of quality anime with Crunchyroll \u2014 you\u2019ll also be privy to premieres shortly after their debut in Japan, such as the highly anticipated Attack on Titan finale.\nCrunchyroll Premium gift card $80 Prices taken at time of publishing. Give the gift of action, romance, and just about every other kind of anime genre for a year $80 at Crunchyroll\nChromecast with Google TV (4K)\nSmart TVs tend to come with a range of downloadable apps built in, but performance is often middling at best \u2014 even in high-end models. If you\u2019re looking for a compact and easy-to-use streaming device, it won\u2019t cost you much. The latest Chromecast is a great choice that provides 4K HDR playback and comes with a voice-enabled remote, which can help you get to your favorite movies and shows faster than fiddling with on-screen keyboards.\nVudu gift cards for watching movies at home\nVudu is like a digital Blockbuster, a storefront with a huge catalog of films that you can rent or buy, ranging from new releases like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem to beloved classics like The Nightmare Before Christmas. Unlike some other gift cards on the market, Vudu\u2019s don\u2019t expire, so you can take your time and save them for a rainy day. They also double as compelling gifts for the cinephile in your life.\nPanasonic DP-UB420\nStreaming has become the de facto way to watch your favorite movies, but sometimes you want the reliability and quality of a physical disc. And what better way to enjoy them than with a dedicated 4K Blu-ray player? There is no better way, dear reader. The Panasonic DP-UB420 is a model that won\u2019t break the bank, yet it can handle everything from CDs and DVDs to 3D Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray Discs, so it should cover your entire physical media collection.\nOne of the DP-UB420-K\u2019s most compelling features is its HDR Optimizer, which, once set up, tweaks your content to look its best on your TV, no matter if it\u2019s a high-end OLED screen or a run-of-the-mill LCD panel.\nRoku Streambar Pro\nIf you\u2019re in the market for both a streaming device and a soundbar, there\u2019s precisely one product we can recommend that can do both: the Roku Streambar Pro. By plugging it into your TV\u2019s HDMI port, you\u2019ll get great sound quality that defies its petite size, and its streaming capabilities are up there with the best of them, providing 4K HDR so all of your movies and TV shows will look their best. The setup also comes with a universal remote that features voice controls.\nVizio 5.1.2 soundbar with Dolby Atmos\nOne of the highlights of going to the cinema is the booming surround sound that envelops the theater. The Vizio M512a-H6, a 5.1.2-channel soundbar setup, attempts to replicate that feeling (and succeeds) at a much smaller scale in your home with a highly configurable package. While the soundbar unit looks like most others out there, it comes with built-in speakers that are aimed upward to bounce sound off your ceiling, simulating the effect you get in theaters. This, plus its two included satellite speakers, allows Dolby Atmos-ready content to sing. Plus, these speakers look great, with a sleek, low-profile design.\nCouchConsole\nCrumb-covered seats and missing controllers can cause frustration when you want to relax, which is why we recommend the CouchConsole, an organizational caddy to keep around your sofa. This snack- (and controller)-protecting companion has a modular design that can be tweaked to fit your needs, and it includes a convenient self-balancing cup holder to avoid dreaded beverage spills when you get a bit too excited.\nThe CouchConsole also features a charging port, so phones, remotes, and controllers can stay juiced regardless of the marathon movie session you plan on undertaking with your friends.\nNetgear Powerline 2000\nThere is nothing more infuriating than slow download speeds on your console, or getting hit with a severely pixelated image during the emotional climax of a film. If you primarily use Wi-Fi for your home theater devices, I might be describing your everyday reality, but it doesn\u2019t have to be like this.\nThe Netgear Powerline helps to mitigate these issues by creating a power plug-based tether between your router and your devices. Each Powerline adapter features an ethernet port, letting you use your home\u2019s electrical lines as an internet pathway. Clever! Just plug one in near your router and connect an ethernet cable, then use another adapter near the device that you want to hard-wire.\nGovee Envisual TV backlight kit\nIf you want to add drama and atmosphere to your nightly viewings, consider the Govee Envisual TV backlight kit, which uses a mountable camera to track what\u2019s on your screen to then project a matching light show behind the TV \u2014 almost as if the colors were bleeding off the screen.\nOnce you\u2019ve got it set up by attaching the camera to either the top or bottom of your TV, you can manage the LED lights with the Govee Home app, or trigger them via voice commands, thanks to Alexa and Google Assistant support.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Thwaites, was published by Polygon on 2023-12-13 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":454}
{"title":"Warner Music Group boss Robert Kyncl on AI, why labels still exist, and 2 other things we learned from his Q&A at the Code Conference","context":"## Warner Music Group boss Robert Kyncl on AI, why labels still exist, and 2 other things we learned from his Q&A at the Code Conference\n\nMBW Reacts is a series of analytical commentaries from Music Business Worldwide written in response to major recent entertainment events or news stories. MBW Reacts is supported by JKBX , a technology platform that offers consumers access to music royalties as an asset class.\nIn recent months, Warner Music Group CEO Robert Kyncl has been keeping a close eye on AI in the music industry \u2013 not surprising, given that he came to the music biz from \u2018Big Tech\u2019, namely YouTube, where he was Chief Business Officer.\nNor is it surprising, given his current role, that he has been pushing for price hikes at music streaming services.\nBoth of these topics came up during Kyncl\u2019s Q&A session at the Code Conference in Laguna Niguel, California, on Tuesday (September 26).\nBut what was maybe more surprising \u2013 for a techie like Kyncl, anyway \u2013 was his rational, level-headed explanation for why traditional music labels continue to be relevant, and continue to thrive, in the current music ecosystem.\nWith the arrival of digital platforms, including open ones like YouTube and SoundCloud \u2013 and with the proliferation of indie music distribution platforms like DistroKid and TikTok\u2019s SoundOn \u2013 it\u2019s inevitable that music biz observers from the world of tech like to speculating about the possibility that music labels could, in the long-term, be headed for irrelevance.\nIn a world where anyone can record music using a desktop audio workstation (DAW) and upload it direct to YouTube, or to Spotify via a distribution platform, labels have little left to do, the argument goes.\nKyncl offered strong a counterpoint to this argument at Code Media, drawing a parallel between music labels today and the advertising industry a decade or two ago.\nAt that time, he said, many predicted ad agencies were headed for the scrap-heap thanks to the arrival of Google\u2019s AdWords, which allowed any business to set up a customized ad campaign on Google services.\nYet ad agencies didn\u2019t go extinct. Today, \u201cthey\u2019re the largest customers of companies like Google,\u201d Kyncl told the audience at the Code Conference.\n\u201cIn the year 2000, when AdWords came out, everybody was predicting their deaths because all the brands [could] just go direct to AdWords and buy ads\u2026 However, what happened was lots of different platforms emerged. Lots of ad tech emerged, complexity increased exponentially, and brands needed help with that, and the agencies provided that value.\n\u201cAnd I see a very close analogy [between that and] our business. Music is incredibly broadly distributed. Everybody on earth listens to music. We\u2019re on every platform. And the complexity is high. And the more people can upload content, and the more people can be heard, the greater the noise, which means it\u2019s harder to cut through the noise and sustain a career.\u201d\nBut a label\u2019s value is not just about building an artist\u2019s career \u2013 it\u2019s about sustaining it once that career is established as well, Kyncl explained.\n\u201cWhen they become established, it is also hard to remain at the top,\u201d Kyncl said. \u201cSo their goals change. And again, we\u2019re there to help with that.\u201d\nHe added later that if you\u2019re a music artist, \u201cyou need a team. You need an army behind you\u2026. if you want a sustainable career, with repeatability and success.\u201d\nHere are three other things we learned from Kyncl\u2019s talk at the Code Conference\u2026\nCredit: Tatiana Shepeleva \/ Shutterstock 1) Music will feel the impact of AI before other industries do \u2013 \u2018within the next year\u2019\nKyncl predicted that the music business will be out ahead of other industries when it comes to exploiting the potential of AI, and it will also \u2013 out of necessity\u2013 be ahead on the issue of how to regulate and monetize the use of AI by non-rights-holders.\n\u201cMusic \u2013 because it\u2019s so broadly distributed and it\u2019s so well aligned with the internet, because it\u2019s short format, it lends itself to recommendations, it\u2019s on all platforms \u2013 is generally first in most transformations and most innovations. So it digitizes first,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhatever happened to the music industry 20 years ago is starting to happen in the movies and TV shows now. In the meantime, music emerged out of [digitization] better and stronger and more resilient. So, I would imagine the same will happen here, which is we\u2019ll likely be first.\u201d\nAsked when that sea change will occur, Kyncl said: \u201cI would say within the next year you will see lots of evolution around AI\u2026 What you will likely see is increasing quality at a very fast pace.\u201d\nKyncl drew an analogy between the explosion of AI use among members of the public and the explosion of user-generated content (UGC) a decade or two ago. Just as user-generated content often infringed on copyright, so too does AI threaten the rights of artists and music rights holders.\n\u201cI would say within the next year you will see lots of evolution around AI\u2026 What you will likely see is increasing quality at a very fast pace.\u201d Robert Kyncl, Warner Music Group\nIn Kyncl\u2019s view, the solutions put in place to address UGC form a \u201cblueprint\u201d than can be used to address AI-generated content on platforms as well.\n\u201cWhen YouTube was formed\u2026 people started to upload content, including copyrighted material, which, obviously, put YouTube into hot water with lots of different copyright holders. And I had the privilege of working through a lot of that and fix it up.\n\u201cBut we made we made a very important decision, which was to go above and beyond the law, and build a fingerprinting software that allowed us to track the copyright on our platform, and then have commercial relationship[s] with copyright holders to send them the money. Out of that we built a multi-billion-dollar business, which now is a multi-billion-dollar business per year. And it was an incredible new revenue stream for everyone. AI is that with new super tools.\u201d\nKyncl was referring to YouTube\u2019s Content ID system, which scours uploaded videos for copyrighted content (video and audio), then offers the copyright owner the option to monetize that video, or to request that it be taken down. The innovative system has essentially allowed YouTube users to upload content without paying much attention to copyright, while ensuring that copyright owners are paid.\nWhen it comes to the proliferation of AI, \u201cwe need to approach it with the same thoughtfulness, and we have to make sure that artists have a choice,\u201d Kyncl added.\nAnd he made it clear that, in his view, simply rejecting AI and fighting against it is not an option.\n\u201cYou have to embrace technology, because it\u2019s not like you can put technology in a bottle. The genie is not going back.\u201d\nBut he cautioned that the technology to develop a Content ID-style system for is \u201cnot yet developed, but\u2026 people are working on that.\u201d\n{Believe CEO Denis Ladegallerie might disagree. In comments earlier this year, Ladegallerie said that the tools to recognize and flag AI-generated content are just about ready to go, and he expects to see them implemented in the coming few quarters.)\n2) The streaming audio business won\u2019t experience the same problems currently hitting streaming video\nThe streaming video business is going through tough times.\nNetflix experienced its first-ever decline in subscriptions last year (though it has since roared back to health); the subscriber count of Disney+ appears to be in freefall; and talk is growing about ongoing consolidation of the many streaming video services that have come online over the past several years.\nAsked if the audio streaming business is likely to go through something similar, Kyncl\u2019s answer was unequivocal.\n\u201cNo. Music is much more resilient. So first, I think what happened in the last 15 years is incredible. They had literally zero people in the subscription model and now we have 700 million people in the world in the premium experience\u2026 which is incredible.\n\u201cAnd I think really credit goes to Daniel Ek for forging the path for everybody. And then companies like Apple and YouTube and Amazon following and building up the [music] business. It\u2019s pretty incredible what has happened.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to embrace technology, because it\u2019s not like you can put technology in a bottle. The genie is not going back.\u201d Robert Kyncl, Warner Music Group\nKyncl added: \u201cI think the opportunity ahead of us is twofold. One, the continued growth in emerging markets, and also the GDPs of those countries will be rising at the same time. So there\u2019s lots of growth there. And then there is the price elasticity optimization in mature markets.\u201d\nThat last point is a reference to the price hikes seen among all the major music streaming services over the past year or so, and the growing belief within the music industry that streaming price hikes will be sustained \u2013 as evidenced recently by Deezer\u2019s second price hike in a year.\nCredit: QuiteSimplyStock\/Shutterstock 3) The hot music rights acquisitions space is \u2018likely slowing down a bit\u2019\nThe second half of 2022 saw a notable slowdown in music rights acquisitions, a phenomenon that some blamed on higher interest rates and the reduced liquidity that came with them.\nAlthough there has been something of a rebound this year, in Kyncl\u2019s view, there is still a slowdown in this space \u2013 though that might be good for Warner Music Group.\n\u201cI think what happened was there was an opening where artists and songwriters were suddenly open to selling catalogs. which they were not open to before. And they just created this incredible tidal wave. And these things happen in waves, ebb and flow.\n\u201cSo I think it likely is slowing down a little bit, but that\u2019s okay. Because it makes the multiples come down a little bit more.\u201d\n\u201cI think what happened in the last 15 years is incredible. They had literally zero people in the subscription model and now we have 700 million people in the world in the premium experience.\u201d Robert Kyncl, Warner Music Group\nIn other words, Warner Music can go out and buy more if the multiples are low enough?\n\u201cOf course. We are in the business of buying catalogs, obviously. We have the publishing catalog of David Bowie, for instance, which we bought a few years ago. So yeah, we are in that business.\n\u201cWe are in the business of administering [rights], which means collecting revenue from thousands of platforms around the world; very complicated matters. But we\u2019re also in the business of ownership.\u201dMusic Business Worldwide\n\nThis article, authored by Daniel Tencer, was published by Music Business Worldwide on 2023-09-28 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":455}
{"title":"French soccer players back African mobile video network StarNews Mobile in $3M round","context":"## French soccer players back African mobile video network StarNews Mobile in $3M round\n\nAfrican mobile video network StarNews Mobile has secured $3 million in pre-Series A funding. StarNews offers African content creators a platform for monetizing their work through a subscription model. Currently, the service is available in six African countries, including Cameroon (where it started), Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Benin and Ivory Coast.\nFounder and CEO Guy Kamgaing launched the startup in 2017. His inspiration for this venture draws from his extensive 10-year experience in content monetization, particularly within the VAS (Value-Added Services) business. During this period, he actively participated in text\/SMS-based campaigns and monetization endeavors, which provided the foundation for StarNews.\nThe five-year-old mobile video network prioritizes offering monetization avenues for African content creators through distribution partnerships with major telecommunications operators like MTN and Orange. Content creators often face challenges in generating revenue due to limitations on existing streaming platforms. As a result, StarNews connects them to mobile users who often lack access to relevant content due to expensive mobile data plans and a shortage of services tailored to local markets. A win-win for both parties.\n\u201cI realized that while I could monetize jokes and horoscopes via telcos for several years, no one was monetizing content on the traditional platforms, especially in Africa,\u201d said the \u200b\u200bLos Angeles-based Cameroonian entrepreneur to TechCrunch. \u201cThere are thousands of creators online that don\u2019t make money on YouTube or other platforms. So it was just putting two and two together, saying, \u2018Well, this content is here that no one knows about and is very difficult to get the audience on YouTube and search, but I can help creators make money because I have a relationship with the telcos.\u2019\u201d\nMobile operators are pivotal in propelling content within Africa\u2019s media industry, with unmatched distribution capabilities. Collaborating closely with these operators is imperative for establishing a solid presence in the market. Over the past few years, these operators have been instrumental in driving data usage across the continent, simultaneously upselling their customers with in-house content or partnering with entities like StarNews. To draw a parallel, Kamgaing stated that you can think of Orange as the \u201cApple\u201d of Africa\u2019s telecommunications world and MTN as the \u201cGoogle.\u201d\nConnecting mobile subscribers to local content creators\nStarNews boasts an active subscriber base of over 4 million through its partnerships with MTN and Orange across six markets (it exited South Africa after a misalignment with MTN\u2019s strategy for engaging content creators) and a community featuring more than 120 content creators. This approach has enabled StarNews to organically expand its user base while securing nearly $8 million (including a $900,000 friends and family round, a $2 million seed investment and a $1.8 million extension) funding from an array of U.S., European and African VCs, including Investisseurs & Partenaires (I&P), Snap via its Yellow Accelerator program, LoftyInc Capital, Graph Ventures and Expert Dojo.\nThe platform is structured around channels, with each creator having a dedicated channel. Kamgaing says the company works closely with creators by providing financial support and assisting in content production; additionally, it guides the creators in their digital journey, offering support in digital acquisition. As previously highlighted, a significant portion of the company\u2019s user acquisition comes through telecom operators, as it\u2019s a seamless process for, say, MTN to send messages encouraging its customers to sign up to Star News to watch social media personalities, including music artists, comedians and influencers. For users, the sign-up process is streamlined for convenience, followed by a straightforward payment mechanism, allowing them to pay using their airtime; this works across six different networks, each offering users various bundles, weekly subscriptions and daily plans.\nIn addition to content produced by creators, StarNews features deeply hyperlocal content, spanning topics such as motorbike taxis in Cameroon or food recipes in Ivory Coast. The platform also hosts genre-specific shows, including the footballing competition African Cup of Nations and a program modeled after a singing reality competition, The Voice. StarNews leverages its partnerships with telecom operators to raise awareness and significantly boost user activations for these shows. For instance, in the 2021 edition of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON), the platform actively produced exclusive content straight from the event, resulting in the acquisition of 600,000 new users. Furthermore, the company sponsors concerts, and at one point, it attracted an impressive 500,000 subscribers by offering them the chance to attend a Fally Ipupa concert.\nThese initiatives highlight the power of strong partnerships, where telcos take the lead, followed by content creators or show organizers, Kamgaing, an ex-PwC consultant, remarked. According to him, this dynamic results in an influx of eager users to access the content or engage with the telco\u2019s activities while positioning StarNews remarkably well to oversee content distribution, monetization, and creation effectively.\n\u201cProduction without distribution is tough and tougher without monetization. There are a lot of people creating content, but they\u2019ll put it on YouTube and Instagram, platforms that control the distribution. There\u2019s no real monetization. We\u2019re able to have all three layers at the local level. We have offices in all the markets and the teams there are specifically working with creators on content production, which is unique,\u201d said the chief executive, while adding that the platform\u2019s content spectrum has expanded to establish significant partnerships with the likes of Sony and Universal in the region.\nOpportunity in Africa\u2019s creator economy sector\nAmong its markets, StarNews has observed the most impressive retention rate in Nigeria, a market that exhibits all the right metrics for exponential growth, according to Kamgaing. Acquiring users is relatively straightforward, and the platform enjoys strong user engagement and stickiness; moreover, monetization is thriving, he said. StarNews employs an internal metric to gauge monetization, known as the billing rate. This metric represents the number of individuals who have sufficient available airtime to pay for digital services; notably, the billing rate is three times higher in Nigeria compared to the Francophone markets.\nKamgaing revealed that the platform distributed $1 million to content creators last year while maintaining an average monthly payout of around $70,000 to these creators. The fresh injection of capital serves as a significant uplift for Africa\u2019s creator economy, an underserved sector in African tech (despite that startups like e-commerce-focused Selar are holding their own). This funding will equip the Los Angeles-based company, currently with 40 employees, to better support its creators and gradually enhance payouts in the coming years, a crucial step in bolstering the region\u2019s creative industry.\nAdditionally, in a press statement, Kamgaing outlined the startup\u2019s expansion plans, noting its intent to strengthen its dominant presence in Francophone Africa while quickly expanding across strategic markets like Nigeria and Ghana. StarNews is looking to be in 11 markets by next year, the chief executive remarked on the call.\nJanngo Capital, an Africa-focused venture capital firm, led the pre-Series A funding round. Other notable investors, such as soccer players Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni of Real Madrid, Jules Kound\u00e9 of Barcelona and Mike Maignan from AC Milan, all affiliated with athlete representation agency Excellence Sport Nation, participated in the round. Kamgaing, in the interview, highlighted the shared African heritage of these players, underscoring their connection to StarNews\u2019 mission and their genuine interest in engaging with the African audience and investing in startups across the continent. These French soccer players now join the ranks of investors like Blaise Matuidi, a former French international who has previously invested in Sudanese fintech company Bloom and currently heads Origins, a VC firm in collaboration with other soccer players who serve as limited partners.\nFatoumata B\u00e2, founder and executive chair of Janngo Capital, affirmed the firm\u2019s support for StarNews, accentuating the platform\u2019s unique positioning, strategic partnerships, technology and content. This support is rooted in the belief that StarNews is well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth potential of Africa\u2019s creative industry, which is poised for a fourfold expansion by 2050 and the possibility to generate up to $20 billion in GDP, she said.\n\u201cI am very excited and proud to back StarNews, the first media platform that supports African creators and tells the world the real African story,\u201d added Fernand Tchouameni, spokesperson and investment advisor for Aurelien Tchouameni. \u201cBeing of Cameroonian descent, I can also see StarNews becoming a bridge to connect with the African diaspora, and I personally look forward to being on it.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Tage Kene-Okafor, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":456}
{"title":"EU commissioner sidesteps MEPs\u2019 questions about CSAM microtargeting","context":"## EU commissioner sidesteps MEPs\u2019 questions about CSAM microtargeting\n\nThe European Union\u2019s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, has confirmed the Commission is investigating whether or not it broke recently updated digital governance rules when her department ran a microtargeted political ad campaign aiming to drive support for a controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM)-scanning proposal she\u2019s spearheading.\nBut at a committee hearing in the European Parliament today she deflected MEPs\u2019 enquiries for her to give more details about the ad campaign.\nThe governance regulation concerned is the Digital Services Act (DSA), which includes provisions relating to online advertising \u2014 including a prohibition on the use of sensitive personal data, such as political opinions, for targeting ads. While the ads in question ran on X (formerly Twitter) \u2014 which is already expected to be compliant with the DSA, having been designated by the Commission as a so-called Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) back in April.\nThe Commission itself, meanwhile, not only proposed this pan-EU law but is responsible for oversight of VLOPs\u2019 DSA compliance. So \u2014 tl;dr \u2014 if EU officials have used X\u2019s ad-targeting tools to break the bloc\u2019s own digital rulebook it\u2019s the very definition of an awkward situation.\nThe existence of the Commission\u2019s microtargeted ad campaign seeking to drum up support for its proposed CSAM-scanning law was spotted last month by technologist, Danny Meki\u0107. An article with his findings ran in Dutch newspaper, De Volkskrant, earlier this month.\nUsing public ad transparency tools the DSA requires VLOPs to provide, Meki\u0107 found the Commission had run a paid advertising campaign on X, targeting users in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal and the Czech Republic \u2014 countries that were not supportive of Johansson\u2019s CSAM-scanning proposal according to leaked minutes from a September 14 meeting of the European Council, a co-legislative body that\u2019s involved (along with MEPs) in determining the final shape of the CSAM law.\nPer Meki\u0107, the Commission\u2019s ad campaign, which apparently racked up millions of views on X, insinuated that opponents of the proposed legislation did not want to protect children \u2014 messaging he dubbed \u201ca form of emotional blackmail\u201d.\nThe ads included what he suggested is a misleading claim that the majority of Europeans support the proposal \u2014 but which is based on a survey that highlighted \u201conly the benefits but not the drawbacks of the proposed legislation\u201d. Other surveys, by research firms YouGov and Novus, that highlighted the drawbacks showed \u201cvirtually no support\u201d for the plan among the European population, his post also pointed out.\nGoing into more detail of the microtargeting used by the Commission, Meki\u0107 wrote: \u201cX\u2019s Transparency Report shows that the European Commission also used \u2018microtargeting\u2019 to ensure that the ads did not appear to people who care about privacy (people interested in Julian Assange) and eurosceptics (people interested in \u2018nexit\u2019, \u2018brexit\u2019 and \u2018spanexit\u2019 or in Victor Orb\u00e1n, Nigel Farage, or the German political party AfD). For unclear reasons, people interested in Christianity were also excluded.\n\u201cAfter excluding critical political and religious groups, X\u2019s algorithm was set to find people in the remaining population who were indeed interested in the ad message, resulting in an uncritical echo chamber. This microtargeting on political and religious beliefs violates X\u2019s advertising policy, the Digital Services Act \u2013 which the Commission itself has to oversee \u2014 and the General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR].\u201d\nDuring an exchange of views with the European Parliament\u2019s civil rights, justice and home affairs (LIBE) committee this afternoon, Johansson admitted the EU\u2019s executive is investigating the matter.\nInitially she had sought to dismiss criticism over the legality of the microtargeting \u2014 claiming in a tweet earlier this month (embedded below) that the campaign was \u201c100%\u201d legal.\nAsked by the LIBE committee about the discrepancy between her tweet and the existence of an investigation Johansson said she had been given \u201cnew information\u201d related to DSA compliance that merited looking into.\nAs my services have been directly accused of illegal acts\ud83d\udc47 I think it is import I step in:\n1. @EUHomeAffairs have followed the guidelines & the law 100%\n2. The promotion of our proposal is standard normal practice\n3. This proposal is about protecting children from sexual abuse https:\/\/t.co\/zSSAu3684P \u2014 Ylva Johansson (@YlvaJohansson) October 13, 2023\n\u201cWhen I made a tweet on the 100% legal [point] that was based on the information I had. But I have to be very open; then I got other information that there could be question marks on the compliance with the DSA \u2014 and I take this very seriously,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cIf that is the case then of course there has to be consequences on that. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we have to look into [it]. Of course we always have to comply with the regulation. There\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\nThe LIBE committee repeatedly pressed Johansson to provide detailed about the microtargeted ad campaign \u2014 but she declined to do so, saying she did not have any information about it and that it was for her \u201cservice\u201d, who she suggested had been responsible for the campaign, to answer. So there was no explanation about why, for instance, Christians had been explicitly excluded from the Commission\u2019s microtargeting.\nShe also avoided giving a direct response to accusations by MEPs that the use of political microtargeting by the Commission was anti-democratic \u2014 opting instead to mount a general defence of its right to promote its proposals. She also listed a number of other departments within the Commission she said had previously used ads to promote separate legislative proposals.\n\u201cI think that the commission should defend and explain and promote our proposals. We do that and we have done that. And I think it\u2019s a good practice to do so. Because we are we are taking stance and we should defend our stance,\u201d she told the committee.\nA number of MEPs pushed back \u2014 including by pointing out that there are more appropriate channels for the Commission to engage directly and transparency with co-legislators than opaque behavioral ad targeting on platforms like Twitter\/X.\n\u201cOne principle of democracy is that we have procedures because the end doesn\u2019t justify the means,\u201d opined MEP Sophie in \u2018t Veld. \u201cAnd European Commission has the right to be very attached to its legislative proposals but there are privileged channels for the European Commission to communicate with the two legislators and others \u2014 not an ad campaign on Twitter.\u201d\nDespite a lot of pushback, the committee was unable to extract any other lines from commissioner on the ad campaign. But at the end of the session she did agree to respond to it in writing with some missing answers \u201cas soon as possible\u201d (albeit, avoiding agreeing to do so by the end of the week, as one MEP had asked).\nCommercial influence\nWhile many of the questions directed at her over the 1.5-hour long hearing focused on the controversy that\u2019s sprung up around the ad campaign, parliamentarians also pressed the commissioner on a number of other issues \u2014 including concerns about the extent of commercial lobbying around the CSAM-scanning proposal.\nThis has been a topic of intense interest, especially following a report by investigative journalists published last month by BalkanInsight which looked at close contacts between Johansson\u2019s department and companies with CSAM-scanning and other child safety tools to sell.\nOne of the journalists involved in that investigation, Apostolis Fotiadis, had also been invited by the committee to participate in the exchange of views \u2014 and he took the opportunity to defend their reporting from direct public attacks by Johansson.\nIn a blog post ahead of today\u2019s hearing \u2014 which deploys a crisis-PR-esque headline claim of \u201csetting the record straight\u201d \u2014 she criticized the article as \u201ca series of insinuations looking for a home\u201d; claiming it paired an outline of \u201ca selection of meetings I had, of events I attended, or conferences I addressed\u201d with \u201ca conspiratorial tone\u201d in an attempt \u201cto create the impression of financial influence where there is none\u201d.\nFotiadis was asked by the LIBE committee about the accusation that the journalists had, essentially, been spreading disinformation \u2014 and specifically whether he believed Johansson and the Commission\u2019s response to it amounted to a restriction on media freedom. He responded by saying he did not think that was the case. But went on to express surprise at how the Commission had reacted to the scrutiny \u2014 to its instinct to deploy \u201cspin-doctor\u201d tactics to try to discredit the article, rather than engaging with the substance of the concerns being raised.\nThe Commission risks straying close to making attacks on journalists by using such tactics, Fotiadis warned \u2014 adding: \u201cYou cannot just dismiss everything by calling fake news\u201d \u2014 before also noting that Johansson\u2019s office had declined multiple interview requests ahead of publication of the article.\nResponding to a question from the committee about the reporting he said documents obtained by the journalists included email threads between Commission officials in Johansson\u2019s department, DG-Home, and a \u201ckey stakeholder\u201d advocating for the use of technology for CSAM-scanning \u2014 which indicated what he described as \u201cprivileged access\u201d that \u201cspeaks directly to cooperation\u201d and goes \u201cway beyond\u201d mere consultation or exchange of views on the proposal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an official chain discussing invitation, how the stakeholder would be able to allocate experts that would speak in workshops \u2014 first attended by representatives of the Member States, and then afterwards actually by ministers in the Council in a meeting chaired by commissioner Johansson. So when we say facilitate, it\u2019s obvious that the EU officials discuss what kind of experts will be available from this particular stakeholder to attend these meetings and to present the point of view, which seems to be a privileged access,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cAlso in the same email thread there\u2019s mention of EU officials being allocated to specifically attend the cooperation between the stakeholder and DG-Home on the proposal, which to our understanding is something that goes way beyond the level of consultations or exchange of views or exchange of opinions on the proposal and speaks directly to cooperation.\u201d\nThe committee took the opportunity to press Johansson about her contacts with companies and other lobbyists during the drafting of the CSAM-proposal, with MEPs saying they want clear answers to the allegations of commercial interest and heavy lobbying when the Commission was setting up and drafting the proposal.\nIn the event MEPs got some bare bones detail.\nAsked for a list of these contacts, the commissioner responded that she\u2019d met with Google six times; Microsoft, Meta and TikTok three times each; twice with Twitter (X); and once apiece with Apple and Amazon. She also said she\u2019d met with the child safety organizations Thorn (twice) and Brave Movement (twice); and with Tech Alliance and ICANN once apiece.\nIn wider responses related to concerns about how much commercial interest had influenced the Commission, Johansson highlighted her decision for the CSAM-scanning proposal to be \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d \u2014 meaning the draft regulation does not support any specific tech solution \u2014 with the suggestion being EU lawmakers had resisted lobbying by companies for a law that would explicitly favor their existing tech tools.\nShe also denied that only Thorn and Microsoft have technology \u201cthat is necessary for the scanning\u201d \u2014 claiming that\u2019s \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d.\n\u201cThere are no specific technologies mentioned [in the proposal] and I think this is an important part. So there\u2019s no specific technology that\u2019s been favoured in this proposal,\u201d she also told the committee, adding: \u201cSo many technologies are being developed all the time \u2014 while we are speaking \u2014 and they will continue to develop. So I think it\u2019s important that the legislation has to be technology neutral.\u201d\nEarlier this week a seminar organized by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), an advisory body to the Commission on data protection law, heard from more than 20 speakers across civil society, academia and industry expressing deep misgivings about the Commission\u2019s approach \u2014 including a warning from the EDPS himself that the EU could be at a tipping point for freedom and democracy if it does not turn back from the plan to do non-targeted scanning of private messages.\nJohansson had been invited to participate in the seminar but declined to attend. She didn\u2019t offer a direct response to the EDPS\u2019 concerns today but she did counter a number of arguments heard at the session earlier in the week \u2014 including refuting the suggestion that her proposal amounts to mass surveillance.\n\u201cMy proposal would not mean that all communication will be scanned. Compared to the situation today it will be much more limited,\u201d she claimed, referencing the temporary ePrivacy derogation that currently gives messaging firms a legal basis to scan non-encrypted content for CSAM (but is intended to be replaced by the proposed regulation which, critics contend, will force platforms to scan end-to-end encrypted content too). \u201cToday companies are allowed to scan if they search for child sexual abuse material. That\u2019s why we receive these 5.2 million videos and pictures and grooming attempts \u2014 70% from private communication. If my proposal is adopted, this will be limited.\u201d\nShe also emphasized how the proposal first requires in-scope platforms to deploy prevention measures to try to stop the spread of CSAM and\/or prevent abuse of their tools by people intent on abusing children. \u201cFirst comes prevention. Only if prevention is not enough, then you might be allowed to do detection \u2014 but only after a court decision,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo only those that really cannot deal with the problem with mitigating measures\u2026 and only after a court decision and only during a specific period they will be allowed to do the detection,\u201d she went on. \u201cWe will also limit the reporting so that we will also receive fewer but hopefully better reports.\u201d\nJohansson\u2019s arguments to MEPs that her proposal does not overreach also lent on the existence of other EU laws \u2014 such as the bloc\u2019s data protection framework \u2014 which she suggested will act as balancing checks on the scope of possible CSAM-scanning. \u201cIt\u2019s also important that we continue to comply with all relevant legislation. For example the GDPR and other requirements, there are no derogation from that in my proposal,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important \u2014 and I know that\u2019s been part of the debate \u2014 that it should not be a slippery slope,\u201d she added. \u201cThe proposal specifically prohibits using the detection technologies for any other purpose than the detection of child sexual abuse online \u2014 and only with verified indicators of child sexual abuse provided by the EU Centre.\u201d\nGiven her reliance on pointing to the existence of a wider EU legal framework doing the heavy lifting and protecting Europeans\u2019 fundamental rights as a strategy to assuage critics, and given she\u2019s also invoking respect for the rule of law as a buttress against the risk of content-scanning mission creep, it\u2019s doubly relevant that the Commission now finds itself in a bind \u2014 forced to investigate whether its own officials ignored legal requirements in a bid to covertly sweep past critics.\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-25 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":457}
{"title":"10 Minute School aims to democratize education for Bangladeshi students","context":"## 10 Minute School aims to democratize education for Bangladeshi students\n\nAccess to education in Bangladesh is filled with inequalities, say the founders of edtech 10 Minute School. Many rural areas don\u2019t have good learning centers and as a result, students travel to capital Dhaka to prepare for their university admission exams. That option, however, is only available to families who have the financial means.\nOriginally created as a YouTube channel, 10 Minute School (shortened to 10MS) wants to democratize access to supplementary education for K12 students throughout the country. The startup, which says it is the largest edtech company in Bangladesh, announced today it has raised a pre-Series A of $5.5 million, the highest seed-stage funding so far for a Bangladeshi startup. This brings 10MS total raised to $7.5 million.\n10MS offers live-streamed classes for K12 students, pre-recorded lessons, university admission test prep and personalized quizzes, among other content, that can be accessed through a smartphone app. So far, it has 35,000 recorded video lessons and over 82,000 quizzes, along with resources like model tests, ebooks and lecture notes that cover the entire national curriculum. 52% of its students are from rural and semi-urban areas outside of Dhaka, and 34% are girls (one of 10MS\u2019s goals is to address gender inequalities in education).\nThe company\u2019s new round comes from a combination of private and government investors. The funding was led by Conjunction Capital, with participation from returning investor Peak XV\u2019s Surge (formerly Sequoia Capital India), the Bangladesh government\u2019s sovereign venture fund, Startup Bangladesh Limited, CRED founder and CEO Kunal Shah, MyAsiaVC managing partner Sajid Rahman and several local angel investors.\nCo-founder Ayman Sadiq started 10MS as a YouTube channel in 2015. Sadiq, who has taught since 2012, was previously a teacher at a leading coaching center in Dhaka. During that time, he realized many of his students faced two obstacles: the cost of tuition and of traveling to Dhaka from their hometowns, which didn\u2019t have coaching centers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the naive idea came into being that I could record all the videos and upload them onto YouTube for free, so no one needed to come to the capital city and no one needed to pay anything,\u201d Sadiq says. He was also heavily inspired by online learning platforms like Khan Academy and edX. After hitting a following of 100,000 people on YouTube, Sadiq said he realized the idea was scalable.\nBetween 2015 and 2019, the YouTube channel took on sponsors, including telecom operators, electronics companies and FMCG brands, and produced more than 25,000 videos covering the entire K12 syllabus. Then the pandemic hit and sponsors began dropping out. Sadiq realized that in order to make his project sustainable, he would have to create a paid version. So 10MS produced its first premium product, a paid book and course.\n\u201cInterestingly, that paid book and course individually had more than 100,000 paid users,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that instantly gave us an idea of, okay, we can actually monetize some of our offerings and solutions and make a sustainable business out of it.\u201d\nThe fledging company started looking for investors, and in 2022, it raised $2 million in seed funding led by Surge, Sequoia India\u2019s (now Peak XV) scale-up program.\nNow that 10MS has raised its pre-Series A, it plans to invest in its tech capabilities, content and operations, says co-founder and COO Mirza Salman Hossain Beg. He added that 10MS\u2019 goal is to provide personalized learning experiences for students by using AI and it will bring in more engineers and product managers to support its tech development.\nAnother major area of investment for 10MS is content that fits with Bangladesh\u2019s evolving K12 curriculum. \u201cThe government in Bangladesh right now is going through a lot of massive changes in the national curriculum, and as a result of that, there will be a lot of new content to be created to support the new curriculum,\u201d Beg says.\n10MS is also currently exploring a hybrid online\/offline model, with centers for after school education, and creating a new vertical for its English material by building a separate sales team.\nInterestingly enough, the last Bangladesh startup to raise the highest seed-stage funding in the country was also an edtech. Shikho, which focuses on elementary school learners, raised a total of $5.3 million in seed funding as of March 2022. Shikho is one of 10MS\u2019s competitors, but Beg says 10MS has the advantage of being older and larger, and teaching a wider range of grades.\nWhen asked what\u2019s driving interest in edtech in Bangladesh, Beg said the country\u2019s educational system faces many challenges. \u201cWe have a huge student base of 42 million enrolled in the K12 system and the majority of students don\u2019t have access to quality teachers, quality content, because those who are actually living outside the capital city don\u2019t have good teachers in their area,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental problem that needs to be solved is access to quality content and teachers in a very affordable manner.\u201d Edtech has the opportunity to democratize access to education, reaching students on their phones wherever they are.\nIn an investor quote, Conjunction Capital managing partner Kirill Kozhevnikov said, \u201cThis marks our first venture into the Bangladesh market, and we are confident that this partnership will redefine the education landscape in the country.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Catherine Shu, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-12 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":458}
{"title":"'We know far more about the deep ocean than the moon or Mars,' says explorer Jon Copley","context":"## 'We know far more about the deep ocean than the moon or Mars,' says explorer Jon Copley\n\nThe deep sea has become a \"realm of myth and darkness,\" says ocean explorer Jon Copley. (Image credit: inusuke via Getty Images)\nOcean explorer Jon Copley has completed dozens of dives to the darkest corners of the deep sea. Yet he is still amazed every time he encounters the strange life forms that thrive there. Over the past 25 years, Copley has traveled to the world's deepest hydrothermal vents , to Antarctica's icy \"midnight zone\" and to spectacular undersea mountain chains across the planet.\nAs a professor of ocean exploration and science communication at the University of Southampton in the U.K., Copley dedicates much of his time to addressing the myriad questions and myths surrounding the deep sea. His new book \"Deep Sea: 10 Things You Should Know\" (Orion Publishing, 2023) takes a fascinating look at some of the harshest habitats on Earth.\nIn a video interview with Live Science, Copley described the latest discoveries and where deep sea research is heading in a warming world.\nSascha Pare: Four years ago, when I was a student sitting in your deep sea ecology lectures, you had just published your first book, \"Ask an Ocean Explorer\" (Hodder & Stoughton, 2019). That book had 25 chapters, each answering a question that people commonly ask you as a deep sea biologist. What did you set out to do in \"Deep Sea: 10 Things You Should Know\"?\nRelated: Bizarre, alien-like creature discovered deep in Atlantic Ocean has 20 gangly arms\nJon Copley: This new book answers the top 10 questions that I know people have about the deep sea and also tackles some of the myths and popular misconceptions that we sometimes hear. The shorter format is an opportunity to focus and update the information \u2014 there have been quite a few discoveries in lots of different aspects of deep sea biology since I wrote \"Ask an Ocean Explorer.\"\nWe know far more about the deep ocean and its inhabitants than about the moon or Mars, says Jon Copley. (Image credit: Giordano Cipriani via Getty Images)\nSP: Research has made great strides in recent years, I'm sure. What are some of the most exciting, new discoveries you discuss in the book?\nJC: We're finding out a lot more about how deep sea animals interact with each other and their environment. An area where we've seen a lot of interesting papers over the past five years has been in sensory ecology \u2014 realizing how animals perceive their environment, how they respond to that, how they avoid being seen by predators... It was nice to bring some of those together in a couple of the chapters.\nSP: Some of the chapters focus on dispelling misconceptions people might have about what's down there in the ocean. What, to your mind, is the biggest, most pervasive myth about the deep sea?\nJC: It's the idea that we know almost nothing about it. There's this very popular idea that we know more about the moon or Mars than the deep ocean. That's only really true for one very specific aspect of knowledge \u2014 having a detailed map of the terrain of its solid surface \u2014 because the moon and Mars are not covered in seawater, which blocks radar and means we have to use sonar in the deep ocean. Apart from that, we know far more about the deep ocean than those other places.\nSP: The deep sea has attracted a lot of attention recently in the advent of deep sea mining . How worried are you about that?\nJC: I think it's great that deep sea mining has made people care more about the deep ocean, but it hasn't actually started yet and research does not support some of the more hyperbolic headlines.\nRelated: More than 5,000 new species found in 'pristine' deep-sea wilderness. But they could soon be wiped out.\nThere's a lot of research focused on how we're going to manage mining, if it does go ahead. And there are some habitat types in the deep ocean that we don't need to do further research on, because we know they are so vulnerable. We know that we would risk species extinction at active hydrothermal vents, for example, because they're a tiny habitat globally \u2014 just 50 square kilometers [19 square miles] \u2014 with more than 400 animal species not found in any other habitat type. But I'm confident that we will see protection for active hydrothermal vents, because we scientists have been saying that for years.\nHydrothermal vents are some of the most vulnerable deep sea habitats and home to 400 animal species not found anywhere else. (Image credit: Universal History Archive\/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nSP: Deep sea mining is perhaps more manageable in terms of its impacts than other human activities. If not mining, what is the biggest human threat to the deep sea?\nJC: To my mind, it's climate change . And it affects the deep ocean in lots of different ways. The one that concerns me particularly is deoxygenation \u2014 the reduction in oxygen levels \u2014 because deep sea animals need oxygen and they get it from the seawater.\nOxygen is carried down by currents that form in the polar regions and sink and spread throughout the deep ocean. As a result of climate change, the ocean is getting warmer and that means it can't carry as much dissolved oxygen . When water is warmer, the metabolism of things living in the water runs faster and they use up oxygen more quickly, so that makes the problem even worse. And thirdly, we know that the currents carrying oxygen down to the deep ocean are weakening , because melting ice sheets are making the water fresher and blocking the formation of dense water than sinks.\nThose currents take centuries to complete their journey, which means the changes we have already made are going to carry on being felt for centuries. The deep ocean is already on track to have 10% less oxygen overall globally than it did in preindustrial times by 2400. It's hard to predict what the knock-on effects are going to be, but they are going to be widespread and they are coming.\nSP: You dedicate much of your time to communicating deep sea science with lay audiences. Why is that so important to you?\nJC: I enjoy talking to people about the deep sea because it's not somewhere we think about every day. We can go out at night and if we look at the sky, we might wonder about what's going on up there. But you can't glance into the deep sea in the same way, so it has become a realm of myth and darkness. Even the names of the deepest bits of the deep sea \u2014 the abyssal plains and the hadal zone \u2014 evoke that kind of underworld. It's nice to be able to shine a light on that for people and to highlight how our lives are connected to it.\nThe deep sea and the names we give some its features evoke \"some kind of underworld,\" says Jon Copley. (Image credit: A. Martin UW Photography via Getty Images)\nSP: Speaking of the sky, how does exploring the deep ocean inform the search for life outside our solar system ?\nJC: Deep sea exploration has shown us that the range of conditions under which life can thrive is far greater than we imagined. The idea that chemosynthesis \u2014 where life is powered by a form of chemical energy instead of sunlight with photosynthesis \u2014 could sustain whole populations of animal species was impossible, until we discovered hydrothermal vents and other, similar habitats.\nDeep sea vents also glow very faintly \u2014 too faintly for the human eye to see, but bright enough that microbes can use it as an energy source. Again, it expands our notion of what's possible in the cosmos, because you don't necessarily have to be that close to a bright star, potentially, to sustain life.\n\"Deep Sea: 10 Things You Should Know\" is available in the U.K. to order on Amazon .\nThis interview has been condensed and lightly edited for length.\nDeep sea creatures have evolved extreme strategies to cope with their environment.

{"title":"'They seemed primed to take over': How the Great Dying doomed the 'beast tooth' and set the stage for the dawn of the dinosaurs","context":"## 'They seemed primed to take over': How the Great Dying doomed the 'beast tooth' and set the stage for the dawn of the dinosaurs\n\nInostrancevia is a genus from the extinct group Theriodontia that appeared during the Middle Permian. (Image credit: Stocktrek Images\/Getty Images)\nThe excerpt below is taken from \"Our Fragile Moment: How Lessons from Earth's Past Can Help Us Survive the Climate Crisis\" (Hachette Book Group, 2023), by Michael Mann. It looks at how climate change following the Cambrian explosion caused the biggest mass extinction on Earth \u2014 dooming the creatures set to dominate and set the stage for dinosaurs to rule.\nThe mechanisms that can freeze the planet, as was the case with Snowball Earth can also lead to inhospitably hot climates, when enough carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere. Arguably the greatest extinction event of all time \u2014 called the Great Dying \u2014 appears to have resulted, at least in part, from a massive heat-inducing release of carbon into the atmosphere 250 million years ago.\nIs this ancient event a possible analog for a sixth, human-caused, climate-change-driven mass extinction today? In answering this question, we will at times work our way through some details of the science, but the payoff is that we will see not just that scientists are able to unravel such mysteries, but how they do it.\nIn the late Proterozoic eon, around 550 million years ago, Earth had thawed out from a series of major glaciations, perhaps even global snowball conditions. The end of the Proterozoic marked the beginning of a brand new era \u2014 the Paleozoic, which extended from around 540 million to 251 million years ago.\nThe first period of the Paleozoic \u2014 the Cambrian \u2014 saw a remarkable explosion in the diversity of life, known, appropriately, as the Cambrian explosion. Most of the life that exists today emerged during the first 10 million years of that period, including the first complex multicellular life and familiar groups such as mollusks and crustaceans.\nThe ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, which formed around 600 million years ago. (Image credit: Mark Garlick\/Science Photo Library\/Getty Images)\nAmong the reasons for this remarkable diversification was a sustained rise in oxygen from photosynthetic life. Higher levels of oxygen allowed for more diverse, multicellular organisms because they require oxygen in high enough concentrations that it can reach interior cells. The stratospheric ozone layer, which had developed during the Neoproterozoic era (1 billion to 538 million years ago), protected animals from the sun's damaging ultraviolet rays and helped populate the land. Some researchers even argue for a possible \"bottleneck\" effect, where the few life-forms that survived the Neoproterozoic ice ages (Snowball Earth or not) were able to rapidly fill emerging niches as Earth thawed.\nRelated: 'Once again, innovation and proliferation ended with catastrophe': The environmental disaster of plants taking over the world\nA major glacial event occurred at the end of the following period of the Paleozoic, the Ordovician, around 450 million years ago, as chemical weathering outpaced the volcanic emissions of gas and atmospheric CO2 levels dropped. The resulting cooling caused a buildup in ice mass on the large South Pole\u2013centered supercontinent of Gondwana. Sea levels dropped. Much of the coastal habitat that had been home to primitive mollusks and crustaceans disappeared. Some of the creatures scraped by, but about half of all existing genuses perished. Much as we can only wonder today what knowledge was lost in the ransacking of the Library of Alexandria, we can also ponder what sort of magnificent creatures born of the Cambrian explosion were lost. Welcome to the first of the widely recognized global mass extinction events. It will hardly be the last we encounter.\nThe most well-known extinction event ended the reign of the dinosaurs roughly 66 million years ago. But the deadliest extinction event took place at the end of the Permian period, roughly 250 million years ago. It is referred to in the scientific community as the Permian-Triassic (or P-T for short) extinction, but because an estimated 90% of all Permian species disappeared from the face of the planet, it has earned a nickname: the Great Dying. Marine organisms were hit especially hard, with 96% of species perishing. Gone were the trilobites so familiar to amateur fossil collectors everywhere \u2014 primitive arthropods that were the distant ancestors of the modern horseshoe crab. Having survived the earlier Ordovician extinction event, their own nearly 300-million-year moment had come to an end.\nA giant dragonfly from the Carboniferous period that was wiped out in the Great Dying mass extinction. (Image credit: Mark Garlick\/Science Photo Library\/Getty Images)\nNot only were the vast majority of marine invertebrates gone, but so were the earliest fish species. On land, more than two thirds of amphibian and reptile species and nearly one third of insect species were wiped out. Another iconic species, a giant dragonfly called Meganeuropsis with a nearly three-foot (0.9 meter) wingspan that is often included in artist depictions of the Carboniferous period \u2014 and to this day still haunts my nightmares \u2014 was now gone.\nThe P-T extinction event wiped out many of the groups that had dominated life on land, freeing up ecological niches to be filled by new organisms, including reptiles such as crocodiles and the earliest dinosaurs. Once again, there were both winners and losers. Who won and who lost, in this case, came down to geology and geochemical weathering cycles.\nDinosaurs, it turns out, were direct beneficiaries of the P-T extinction event.\nMidway through the Paleozoic, around 420 million years ago, we saw the emergence of plants with roots, stems, and leaves, which as we now know helped accelerate chemical weathering by producing acids that dissolve rock, helping cycle water from the soil back into the atmosphere. This may have led to a slow, steady decrease in atmospheric CO2 levels through the late Paleozoic. The spread of these vascular plants, however, also led to a new source of organic matter that could be buried on land or carried off in rivers for ocean burial. Increased burial of organic matter causes rising atmospheric oxygen levels because that organic matter is the product of photosynthesis, which splits up oxygen and carbon atoms. The carbon, once buried, is no longer available to cannibalize the liberated oxygen. In the Paleozoic, oxygen concentrations climbed as high as 35% (almost twice the current concentration of 21%).\nThose high oxygen levels favored synapsids, creatures with a high metabolism, featuring a single hole in each side of their skull that led to improved jaw function. They were part of a diverse group of four-legged terrestrial animals, including carnivores, insectivores, and herbivores, that first arose in the late Carboniferous and would evolve into the group we today know as mammals.\nSkull of a Rubidgeinae, an extinct subfamily of gorgonopsid therapsids. (Image credit: RMDobson\/Getty Images)\nBy the early Permian, they were the dominant terrestrial species. By the mid-Permian, another group of proto-mammals \u2014 the possibly warm-blooded, somewhat rodent-like therapsids \u2014 emerged and became the new dominant species. By the late Permian, they may have even developed fur. One group, known as Theriodontia (Latin for \"beast tooth\"), displayed a number of evolutionary innovations: A shift in the bones supporting the jaw allowed the jaw to open wider, and may have aided hearing as well. The skull and teeth became larger, the teeth more specialized, and the jaw more powerful. They seemed primed to take over. But it was not to be.\nEverything changed at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Levels of CO2 spiked. That led to massive warming. Plate tectonics by now had brought all the continents together into a single giant continent \u2014 Pangea \u2014 straddled across the equator. It was already difficult for maritime moisture to penetrate deep into the center of the continent. Rapid greenhouse warming made it even hotter and drier, according both to climate model simulations of the end of the Permian and analyses of the fossil river deposits from Pangean floodplains. The sudden drying would have led to the massive die-off of the tenuous, moisture-dependent forests that had arisen over the course of the Paleozoic. That meant less burial of organic matter on land, assisted perhaps by decreased carbon export to the deep oceans due to a collapsing marine food web. Atmospheric oxygen levels appear to have dropped precipitously as a result, reaching concentrations as low as 15% at the P-T boundary.\nPlummeting oxygen levels helped dinosaurs become the dominant group on Earth. (Image credit: Roger Harris\/SPL\/Getty Images)\nThe drop in oxygen was a further contributor to the mass die-off. The combination of greenhouse warming and low oxygen would have led to widespread hypoxia \u2014 a state where organisms simply cannot take in enough oxygen to support metabolism. That's where the dinosaurs come in. The proto-mammals that had come to dominance during the Permian \u2014 the synapsids and therapsids \u2014 had thrived off high oxygen levels. But as oxygen concentrations dropped, they were now poorly suited to their environment.\nEnter the diapsids, a wide-ranging group of tetrapod vertebrates that first emerged during the Carboniferous around 300 million years ago. They include the reptiles, birds, and now-extinct dinosaurs. What distinguished them from their relatives, the synapsids and therapsids, was the presence of two holes (instead of one) on each side of their skull. One subgroup of synapsids, known as archosaurs \u2014 which includes crocodilians and the earliest dinosaurs \u2014 exploited that innovation to develop a more efficient respiratory system that could make more effective use of the available oxygen. That gave them a leg up on the competition when oxygen levels plummeted at the P-T boundary. Dinosaurs, it turns out, were direct beneficiaries of the P-T extinction event.\nOnly a handful of proto-mammals survived. One group that did was known as Cynodontia (\"dog teeth\"). They were our ancestors, and the ancestors of all mammals. At first, they probably looked somewhat like a huge, scaly rat, growing to as much as six feet (1.8 m) in length. Truly a Rodent of Unusual Size if ever there was one. But by the end of the Triassic, they had shrunk to the size of modern-day field mice, hiding behind rocks from their reptilian predators.\nExcerpted from \"Our Fragile Moment: How Lessons from Earth's Past Can Help Us Survive the Climate Crisis\" by Michael E.

{"title":"The new, \u2018efficient\u2019 Spotify has a very different approach to podcasting","context":"## The new, \u2018efficient\u2019 Spotify has a very different approach to podcasting\n\nThis is Hot Pod, The Verge\u2019s newsletter about podcasting and the audio industry. Sign up here for more.\nIn pursuit of profit, Spotify looks to AI rather than original content for its podcasting future\nSpotify shareholders are thrilled with the company reporting an operating profit for the first time in a year, sending the stock up nearly 10 percent on the news. The revenue bump was in large part due to the streamer\u2019s $1 price increase earlier this year, but executives also pointed to the downsizing of the podcast operation \u2014 which included hundreds of layoffs and the dissolution of Gimlet and Parcast \u2014 as a contributing factor. The adage that \u201ccontent is king\u201d no longer applies, with Spotify increasingly focusing on tools that will scale the business rather than content that will attract listeners.\nIn a call with investors, CFO Paul Vogel said that after being a real \u201cdrag\u201d on profit margins in the past, podcasting will soon break even and turn toward profitability. CEO Daniel Ek echoed that sentiment. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly finding new ways to bring more efficiencies out of the business\u2026 We\u2019ve seen some improvements, but you should expect us to continue to look for more improvements going forward because that\u2019s just our modus operandi.\u201d\nWhile Ek and Vogel really hammered that \u201cefficiency\u201d theme (according to my transcript, they said the word more than 30 times over the course of the 50-minute call), what was left unsaid about podcasting spoke louder. In the past, they would excitedly tout how many millions of podcasts were on the platform, the latest new celebrity show, and the area\u2019s explosive growth. But as investors have run out of patience for the time and money such ambitions required, the company\u2019s leadership changed its tune.\nRather than emphasizing, say, its new revenue sharing deal with Trevor Noah or the reliability of The Ringer, Ek pointed to Spotify\u2019s new AI-driven translation product. He pointed to the automatic translation tool as a way of seamlessly scaling podcasts and increasing the amount of content in non-English speaking markets. He also expects AI will be a boon for podcast advertising, as well.\n\u201cCreating a great audio ad is something that\u2019s quite costly and quite expensive for marketers to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat generative AI has the promise to do is allow for that creative cost to come down\u2026 It [also] allows you to scale that creative in unimaginable ways. You can translate whatever creative you had into lots of different languages; you can use the same voice actor; but instead of producing one or two ads, you can have 1,000 or 10,000 or even 100,000 ads that are individually created to each user.\u201d\nI would take that with a grain of salt (we know Ek loves to dream big!!), but it does underscore the newest iteration of Spotify\u2019s podcasting business \u2014 leaner, less splash, and more scale. It doesn\u2019t mean that Spotify\u2019s contributions to podcasting will be insignificant \u2014 as one audio industry professional said to me, the translation thing could be a total game-changer for the medium (if it\u2019s not a complete dud). But we should not expect those contributions to come in the form of original content.\nThe main question I am left with after these results is where Spotify\u2019s licensing deals fit in. I wish during the call that someone had asked Ek about the plan for big-name talent like Joe Rogan, Alex Cooper, and Dax Shepard as their deals come up for renewal. On one hand, they have the scale (Rogan especially). On the other, they cost a chunk of cash (... Rogan especially). I will have more on this later this week, but it will be interesting to see how much Spotify and its investors can stomach spending on the biggest names in podcasting.\nWondery puts its podcasts on TV\nThat\u2019s certainly one way to get podcasts to the masses. Wondery, which is owned by Amazon, will make many of its podcasts available on three new channels on Freevee, an ad-supported video streaming service also owned by Amazon that was formerly known as IMDb TV (yes, Amazon owns IMDb, too).\nOn October 31st, Freevee will launch three dedicated Wondery channels: a flagship channel focused on entertainment programming like Baby, This is Keke Palmer, Business Wars, and American Scandal; Exhibit C, which will feature true crime shows like This is Actually Happening, Dr. Death, and Morbid; Wondery; and Wondery Sports, with shows including Don\u2019t Call It a Comeback and Gladiator. The visuals will be a mix of on-camera recordings, animations, and show art \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t bank on that being the main draw.\nIt\u2019s an interesting strategy for discovery, though I am not sure how replicable it is beyond Amazon. If it is successful, I could see a situation where other AVODs license podcast programming (it\u2019s certainly cheaper than video), but Amazon is in the unique situation where it owns the whole pipeline, so there is not much risk here.\nJoe Rogan Experience is the most-searched podcast, followed by Call Her Daddy and This American Life\nPodBam released a list of the 40 most-searched podcasts, and it is no surprise that Rogan is number one. The Joe Rogan Experience averaged 135,000 monthly searches on Google, followed by Call Her Daddy with 106,000 and This American Life with 81,000.\n\nThis article, authored by Ariel Shapiro, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-25 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":461}
{"title":"Concert movies are the future of pop music fandom","context":"## Concert movies are the future of pop music fandom\n\nConcert tickets are more expensive than ever. Inflation, Ticketmaster\u2019s monopolistic practices, and increased demand after COVID-related touring delays have coincided to create a perfect storm of ticket-buying agony. Tours were never accessible to everyone: Geography, economics, health and safety concerns, and physical or mental ability make stadium and arena concerts \u2014 held only in major metropolitan areas, and only in certain countries \u2014 infeasible and\/or unaffordable for large swaths of global pop music fandom. As fandom\u2019s role as a source of identity and community becomes more precious, and more people than ever want to see certain concerts, the barriers to attending live shows are rising \u2014 so it\u2019s no wonder that concert films are finding expansive new footing.\nTake Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, an almost three-hour filmed version of the pop star\u2019s ongoing concert tour. The movie is now the highest-grossing concert film of all time. That isn\u2019t just because of Taylor Swift\u2019s expansive fandom \u2014 it\u2019s a direct response to the difficulty of getting tickets to her shows. For fans, The Eras Tour offered up-close, intimate access to a show they never would have been able to attend otherwise.\nIn July, Pitchfork reported that the average cost of a ticket for the North American leg of Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was $3,801 \u2014 a 2,321% increase from her 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour, where the average resale price for North American shows was $157. Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour tickets are $19.89 for adults. And people buying those tickets don\u2019t even have to wait in the Ticketmaster queue of terror.\nIn February, one of the other biggest musical artists in the world, K-pop septet BTS, released a filmed version of their \u201cYet to Come\u201d concert, which had been a one-night-only performance for 50,000 lucky fans in Busan, South Korea. The concert film made more than $50 million worldwide, even though the show had previously been streamed via Korean platform Weverse, allowing a reported 49 million fans to watch at home.\nSeeing a concert film in a movie theater isn\u2019t the same as attending a live concert, but it isn\u2019t an inherently lesser experience, either. At least, it isn\u2019t for me, and I attended the Yet to Come concert both in person and in cinemas.\nThe concert film experience has value past its re-creation of a specific intersection of place, time, and performance. I went to theaters to relive the once-in-a-lifetime experience of seeing the show live, but the film version was also its own unique collective fan experience. While I don\u2019t think I need to expound on the glories of in-person shows \u2014 concerts are awesome, and BTS is very good at them \u2014 some aspects of the filmed version gave me new insight into my own live experience.\nIt also let me revisit it without any of the anxiety that often comes with a stadium concert experience. The logistics of getting 50,000 people into a 20-year-old stadium for the Yet to Come show weren\u2019t simple. By the time the members of BTS took the stage in Busan, most of us had been in line for hours with limited access to bathrooms, water, or information about what was going on.\nOnce the concert started, conditions in the 3,000-strong standing areas got intense, as fans pushed toward the stage, crowding people at the front and prompting BTS to alter plans to come down into the audience for their performance of their 2018 hit \u201cIDOL.\u201d This wasn\u2019t my first chaotic, stressful in-person stadium concert experience, and I doubt it will be my last. I\u2019m able and willing to make this trade for the chance to see my favorite musical group perform, but not everyone is, even if they could get tickets.\nWatching the movie version of Yet to Come, I was able to show up at the theater just 20 minutes before showtime. My BTS fan friends and I were all able to go together this time. And we watched the film in a theater full of fellow fans, BTS lightsticks in hand and BT21 Tata headband on head, giving us the same sense of fandom camaraderie as the in-person concert.\nI missed some of the freedom of the in-person concert experience, like being able to choose where to direct my attention across the expansive stage, bedecked with intricate sets calling back to different eras in BTS history. But the clarity and focus of the detail in the concert film helped even the score. At the film, I got a much closer view of the choreography and the BTS members\u2019 interaction, with a close-up camera intimacy I hadn\u2019t gotten in person. I was sharing those fandom moments not only with the other people in my cinema, but with the millions of other fans viewing the same concert film around the world. Yet to Come will stream on Amazon Prime Video starting Nov. 9, further expanding the number of fans who will be able to see it.\nFans usually assume the live experience is superior to the filmed version, but in a time when in-person community is harder to come by than ever and can sometimes mean pushing people\u2019s financial and\/or physical limits, a filmed concert can feel like a gift. BTS, Taylor Swift, and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 whose concert film Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9 hits theaters in December \u2014 all have massive fandoms. But we\u2019re geographically scattered, and often stigmatized by a mainstream culture that belittles female-driven fan culture. I go to a BTS concert to see BTS perform, but also to be among other BTS fans, who already understand why I care so much about a Korean boy band. We trade freebies and photocards, help each other set up our lightsticks, and share our favorite songs or members. Whether in a stadium in Korea or a cinema at my local mall, I go to these events to feel that sense of belonging.\nAttending a concert in person is sometimes used as a way to enforce a kind of fandom hierarchy, as if attending a concert in person makes you a bigger fan. It doesn\u2019t. Fans who are able to attend the stadium and arena concerts for the biggest musical artists in the world aren\u2019t necessarily more passionate. They just have a combination of luck and privilege that others lack. But concert films are leveling the field, dropping some of the barriers of price, location, and accessibility. They may not be the future of pop music for everyone, but they are increasingly looking like the future of pop music fandom. And that\u2019s a good thing. Pop music fandom is a way for us to find collective joy and connection in art, and I want anyone who wants in to be able to join the party.\n\nThis article, authored by Kayti Burt, was published by Polygon on 2023-11-07 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":462}
{"title":"From FAPE\/PEAC to PhilEd","context":"## From FAPE\/PEAC to PhilEd\n\nWe recently presented a paper at the 5th Paderanga-Varela Memorial Lecture entitled \u201cAlternate Service Delivery Systems: Health and Education.\u201d In that lecture, we looked at the Department of Health (DoH) and the Department of Education (DepEd) as service delivery systems, delivering healthcare and education respectively.\nWe concluded that the service delivery system of the DoH is far superior to the DepEd for two main reasons. The first is that the DoH has devolved its hospitals to the local government units while the DepEd has not. Secondly, the DoH has spun off its health financing into the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) while the DepEd has not. In this article we argue for the creation of the Philippine Education Development Fund (PhilEd).\nWhen Isidro Consunji, President of DMCI Holdings, Inc. was asked by his officers what the role of his Chief Financial Officer (CFO) would be, he gave a three-word answer, \u201cFund my dreams.\u201d\nLikewise the role of PhilEd would be to fund the education dreams of all Filipinos especially the neediest and most deserving.\nFilipinos have three dreams in education. The first is to enroll in a chosen course in the school of their choice. This dream will be funded by the School Vouchers Program which will now be transferred from DepEd to PhilEd.\nThe second dream, especially for Filipino parents, is to save enough money to fund the college education of their children, hence the prevalence of pre-need Educational Plans. Unfortunately, most of the pre-need companies went into bankruptcies causing financial ruin and emotional distress to their plan holders. There has been a massive market failure and so government must intervene. But intervention should not involve the government offering educational plans but rather in insuring these plans. Just as the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC) insures the bank deposits of Filipinos, so will the PhilEd insure their educational plans. Just like PDIC which is funded from the premiums paid by the banks, PhilEd will fund this program from the premiums by the educational plan companies. PhilEd will be ideally suited to do this as it could swap the failed educational plans with school vouchers from its repository of school vouchers.\nThe third dream is based on the realization of Filipino school graduates that their learning must continue even as they leave their alma maters. For in this modern age, the fount of personal knowledge must continuously be replenished. In healthcare, we have the Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) which continuously monitor and minister to our health. We need Lifelong Learning Organizations (LLOs) to continuously monitor and minister to our learning. HMOs exist in the Philippines. LLOs do not. In partnership with the international development agencies and the private sector, PhilEd will create this industry. The international development agencies will provide the technical assistance grants that will create the developmental and regulatory framework for the industry while the private sector will organize the LLOs. PhilEd will be the \u201cbastonero\u201d or project manager, managing the project as well as mobilizing government support and assistance.\nFAPE or the Fund for Assistance to Private Education was a part of the Special Fund for Education set aside by the American government in 1963 from the surplus funds authorized by the War Damage Act of 1962 and organized under Executive Order 156 issued by President Ferdinand Marcos on Nov. 5, 1968.\nFrom the initial seed money of $6,154,000 or P215 million (based on the 1968 peso to dollar exchange rate), the FAPE fund in 55 years had barely grown to P277 million. In contrast the trustees managing the fund have expanded their services, basically as service provider to the DepEd. As a consequence, it has been spun off as a separate organization, the Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC).\nOver the years, PEAC has evolved into co-implementing externally funded programs, namely the DepEd\u2019s Education Service Contracting (ESC), Teachers\u2019 Salary Subsidy (TSS), the SHS Voucher Program (SHS VP), the In-Service Training (INSET), and the Bayanihan for Basic Education (BBE) as well as implementing internally funded programs of assistance for private education in the areas of training, school quality assurance, school improvement programs, and grants programs.\nIn sum, the PEAC has been an effective instrument to operationalize \u201ccomplementarity\u201d between private and public schools as provided in the Philippine Constitution. It has also been an incorruptible partner of the education agencies in efficiently co-implementing national subsidy programs for students and teachers in private schools.\nWe propose that FAPE\/PEAC structure and organization be moved to PhilEd. Operationally this would mean folding into PhilEd, the roles and responsibilities of FAPE and PEAC as well as their financial resources.\nFolding FAPE\/PEAC into PhilEd would mean the transfer of the funds of FAPE amounting to P277 million as of May 31, 2022 as well as the assets and liabilities of PEAC amounting to P567 million as of May 31, 2022.\nThe DepEd programs presently being managed by PEAC and lodged in the DepEd budget such as the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) of P9.3 billion in School Year 2021-2022, the Senior High School Voucher Program of P20.3 billion in School Year 2021-2022, and the Teachers Salaries\u2019 Subsidy of P793 million in School Year 2021-2022 will now be lodged in PhilEd.\nThe present Board of Trustees of the Fund which consists of the Secretary of Education as Chairman with the Director-General of the National Economic and Development Authority, the three Presidents of the Association of Christian Schools, Colleges and Universities (ACSCU), the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP) and the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities (PACU) shall also constitute the proposed Board of Trustees of the PhilEd.\nThe management team of PEAC will be the incoming management team of PhilEd.\nInterestingly, PhilHealth, in addition to premiums collected from members as well as subsidies from local governments who have enrolled indigents in the program, receives a share of the \u201csin taxes\u201d collected from Tobacco and Sugar Sweetened Beverage. The justification for this is that tobacco smokers and sugar sweetened beverage drinkers impose an additional burden on the healthcare system of the Filipinos and so must contribute to their health services. In Fiscal Year 2022, this amounted to P74 billion.\nMoreover, under the Universal Health Care Law, PhilHealth receives 50% of the government share from the income of the Philippine Amusement Gaming Corp. (PAGCOR) as well as 40% of the Charity Fund of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). In 2022, this amounted to P188 billion.\nIn like manner, in addition to the school vouchers funded under the Expanded Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education Act, we suggest that PhilEd be allocated a share of the taxes imposed on our extractive industries. This is based on the argument that the depletion of our natural resources can only be justified if the taxes collected will enhance our human resources.\nLike PhilHealth, PhilEd could also be mandated to receive a percentage from the collection of documentary stamps which have recently been raised.\nFinally, PhilEd can be given access to the Special Education Funds of the local school boards of the Local Government.\nCongress enacted Republic Act 7875, known as \u201cThe National Health Insurance Act of 1995,\u201d which created PhilHealth. We are hoping some members of Congress would file a Universal Education Financing Law which would create PhilEd.\nDr. Victor S.

{"title":"Hipgnosis Songs Fund Chair, Andrew Sutch, to step down; all-important \u2018continuation vote\u2019 likely to take place on October 26","context":"## Hipgnosis Songs Fund Chair, Andrew Sutch, to step down; all-important \u2018continuation vote\u2019 likely to take place on October 26\n\nHipgnosis Songs Fund (HSF), the UK-listed music rights fund, looks likely to hold its all-important 2023 \u2018continuation vote\u2019 on Thursday, October 26, according to an announcement from the firm today.\nWhy\u2019s that \u2018likely\u2019 rather than \u2018definitely\u2019? Because there\u2019s still a possibility it might get bumped into November \u2013 the reasons for which we\u2019ll get into later in this article.\nThe \u2018continuation vote\u2019 will take place at HSF\u2019s Annual General Meeting (AGM), and will see the firm\u2019s shareholders vote on whether to keep the entity going as a closed-ended investment entity i.e. a publicly-traded bundle of music rights.\nHow will that vote go? Obviously we don\u2019t know yet \u2013 and there\u2019s the small matter of a $440 million transaction looming that could potentially influence things.\nEven so: one wonders if some new changes at HSF, announced today, are related to this \u2018continuation vote\u2019 \u2013 and whether or not they amount to concessions to help keep HSF investors happy and confident in the firm\u2019s long-term prospects\u2026 and voting \u2018yes, let\u2019s keep going\u2019.\nThe shareholder frustration: NAV vs. public market\nFirst, a bit of important context.\nThe fundamental revenue performance of HSF doesn\u2019t seem to be under scrutiny from shareholders: the company posted its best-ever revenues in the 12 months to end of March, while streaming \u2018pro-forma\u2019 revenue was up 14.8% YoY in calendar 2022.\nWhere HSF shareholders \u2013 as well as its management \u2013 are finding frustration is in the current gulf between the firm\u2019s \u2018operative Net Asset Value\u2019 (\u2018operative NAV\u2019) and its value on the public market (i.e. its share price).\nFor example: On September 14, HSF\u2019s market cap stood at approximately GBP \u00a31.125 billion, which represented a 40% discount on the firm\u2019s operative NAV of USD $2.316 billion as of the end of March this year.\n(Said \u2018operative NAV\u2019 was calculated by an independent valuer \u2013 Citrin Cooperman \u2013 using a discount rate of 8.5%.)\nThis is where the importance of that potential $440 million transaction comes in.\nAs MBW reported earlier this month, Hipgnosis Songs Fund\u2019s shareholders are currently considering a proposal to sell 29 of the company\u2019s catalogs to another Hipgnosis company \u2013 the Blackstone-backed Hipgnosis Songs Capital (HSC) \u2013 for USD $440 million.\nThat potential transaction is being managed for both HSF and HSC by two separate teams within their mutual investment advisor, Hipgnosis Song Management (HSM), which is run and part-owned by Merck Mercuriadis.\nWhen it announced its intention to explore the $440 million catalog sale to HSC two weeks ago, Hipgnosis Songs Fund confirmed that one of its motivating factors was that the transaction could potentially act \u201cas a catalyst for a re-rating of [HSF\u2019s] share price\u201d.\nAka: Increasing that share price to bring it up closer to the current operative NAV of the company.\nHSC\u2019s $440 million offer to acquire the 29 catalogs, HSF confirmed earlier this month, equates to a 26% increase on the amount HSF paid for those catalogs to acquire them in the past.\nThe $440 million price also reflects a +51% premium on the value of the 29 catalogs implied by Hipgnosis Songs Fund\u2019s public market cap for the 30 days ending September 13.\nWhat happened today?\nAmongst the news confirmed by HSF today (September 28) is that the firm\u2019s Chair of its board since 2018, Andrew Sutch, 73, is stepping down, both as HSF board Chair and as a director of the company.\nHSF says it\u2019s begun a process to recruit a new Chair; Sutch (pictured inset) will leave his post as and when this person is hired, or in any case before HSF\u2019s AGM next year (in Q4 2024).\nIn addition, Andrew Wilkinson, 72, has informed the HSF board of his intention to retire as a board director, which will reduce the company\u2019s board to five directors.\nHSF also confirmed a number of other new measures in a \u2018circular\u2019 to its shareholders today.\nThese measures included the fact that, if Hipgnosis Songs Fund shareholders vote to remain a publicly-traded fund (via that 2023 \u2018continuation vote\u2019) at the firm\u2019s next AGM, then another \u2018continuation vote\u2019 will be put in front of HSF shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting in January 2026.\n(The \u2018continuation vote\u2019 that will take place in Q4 2023 has been scheduled ever since HSF went public in 2018 \u2013 i.e. five years after it floated. The 2026 \u2018Continuation Vote\u2019, as newly-agreed, means another one is now being scheduled for around two years\u2019 time.)\nIn addition, HSF today confirmed some new amendments to its \u2018Investment Advisory Agreement\u2019 (IAA) with HSM.\nThese amendments would give HSM a 12-month notice period as HSF\u2019s investment advisor should the IAA be terminated at any point following the upcoming 2023 \u2018continuation vote\u2019.\nAnother clause in the new IAA: If HSF\u2019s share price stands at an average discount to \u2018operative NAV\u2019 of 10% or more across the month of January 2025 (with that NAV determined at the time of publication of HSF\u2019s interim report for the period to September 30, 2024), the HSF board says it intends to serve notice to terminate the IAA with HSM.\nHowever, HSF\u2019s board has also given itself the freedom to un-terminate the IAA during the entire notice period that would follow (e.g. if HSF\u2019s board serves 12-month notice on HSM at the end of January 2025, it would have until the end of January 2026 to withdraw its termination decision).\nOne factor potentially making the future termination of HSM as HSF\u2019s investment advisor less likely? MBW understands that, in such a scenario, HSM would have a first-refusal option to acquire HSF\u2019s copyright portfolio \u2013 and could potentially turn to Blackstone (i.e. the backers of Hipgnosis Songs Capital) to find the money to pull off such an acquisition.\nWhy the $440 million offer is connected to the date of HSF\u2019s \u2018continuation vote\u2019\nWhile HSF shareholders are considering the $440 million offer from HSC to buy the 29 catalogs, other non-Hipgnosis companies are also being invited to make bids for the same portfolio.\nThose bids are enabled by a \u2018go-shop\u2019 clause in the HSF\/HSC proposal that allows the HSF board to consider these non-Hipgnosis approaches for a limited period (until 11.59pm on October 23, to be precise).\nToday (September 28), HSF informed its investors that \u201ccredible third parties are already engaged in this go-shop process\u201d following its announcement on September 14.\nAs we\u2019ve previously reported, there are potential obstacles in the way of these third parties\u2019 bids. These include the fact that HSM (on behalf of HSC) has a \u2018matching right\u2019, meaning that if HSC decides to match the higher bid of a rival, HSF has to sell the catalogs to it \u2013 rather than the rival.\nIn addition, any \u2018superior\u2019 offer would have to exceed the aggregate cash net proceeds that would ultimately reach HSF\u2019s coffers should HSC\u2019s $440 million offer be executed. (Read more about this condition through here.)\nStill, it\u2019s a theoretical possibility that a non-Hipgnosis company swoops for the 29 catalogs from HSF, and gazumps HSC in the bidding process.\nIf a \u2018superior proposal\u2019 (versus the $440 million offer from HSC) is received during the \u2018go-shop\u2019 period, said HSF today \u2013 whether or not HSC uses its \u2018matching right\u2019 to beat it \u2013 it may be necessary to adjourn the HSF AGM (and therefore the 2023 \u2018continuation vote\u2019) into November.\nIn its note to shareholders today, the HSF board reiterated its belief \u2013 and Hipgnosis Song Management\u2019s belief \u2013 that HSF owns \u201ca unique portfolio of iconic, culturally significant songs that will deliver strong long-term value as they benefit from the structural tailwinds in the music industry\u201d.\nThe note added: \u201cFurthermore, the [HSF] Board believes that the Investment Adviser\u2019s approach to Song Management should enable the Company to outperform the wider music market. This has been evidenced by the 44% total return, including right to income, transaction fees and expected taxes, realised since acquisition on the [$440 million] Transaction.\n\u201cFurthermore, the Board and the Investment Adviser are committed to ensuring that this value is achieved for shareholders by a re-rating of the share price and are determined to deliver on the ongoing opportunity of the Company.\u201dMusic Business Worldwide\n\nThis article, authored by Tim Ingham, was published by Music Business Worldwide on 2023-09-28 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":464}

{"title":"What about the Mediterranean lifestyle reduces mortality? Scientists find out","context":"## What about the Mediterranean lifestyle reduces mortality? Scientists find out\n\nScientists unravel the factors of the Mediterranean lifestyle that lead to reduced mortality and how it can be adopted in non-Mediterranean populations.\nPicture this: Olive oil, tomato, garlic, and an abundance of fruits \u2014 a delightful communal meal followed by a short nap. Throw in some sun and moderate warm temperatures and you might find yourself transported to the idyllic Mediterranean.\nBut what if I told you that you bring the benefits of the Mediterranean lifestyle home with you, even if you live far from the region? Just like a cherished souvenir brought back from holidays.\n\u201cThe Mediterranean lifestyle represents a traditional way of living based on a plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and healthy oils (e.g., olive oil), moderated intake of fish, dairy and very low in red and processed meats or sweets along with food habits such as adding spices instead of salt,\u201d explained Mercedes Sotos-Prieto, assistant professor at the Department of Preventive Medicine, Public Health and Microbiology at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid.\n\u201cMeals are something that happens around family and friends,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe conviviality and social aspect are also characteristic. Physical activity is important in the context of community life, and adequate rest including the typical short mid nap or siesta.\u201d\nSotos-Prieto and researchers from the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid in Spain and the Harvard Chan School of Public Health in the USA are exploring the feasibility and impact of adopting the Mediterranean diet and lifestyle among non-Mediterranean populations using locally available products and within their own cultural contexts.\n\u201cWe are seeing the transferability of the lifestyle [outside the Mediterranean] and its positive effects on health,\u201d she added. The most significant perk? A 29% lower risk of mortality in both men and women.\nBreaking down the effects\nScientists stress that the Mediterranean diet should be understood more as a way of life than a mere dietary pattern with scientific evidence acquired over the last four decades establishing its benefits on life expectancy, quality of life, and the prevention of several chronic diseases.\nHowever, the challenge lies in deciphering which elements of the Mediterranean lifestyle contribute most significantly to improved health. Sotos-Prieto and her team designed and developed a Mediterranean lifestyle index called MEDLIFE using a questionnaire that calculated an individual\u2019s adherence to a Mediterranean way of life. This index considers three primary components: food consumption, dietary habits, and physical activity, including rest, social habits, and conviviality.\nThis type of analysis allowed the researchers to dissect the impact of each of these components, even drilling down to specific items like \u201chours of sleep\u201d or \u201csocializing with friends\u201d. Moreover, the MEDLIFE index could help capture synergistic effects of multiple components that may not be apparent when examining individual components in isolation.\nIn their study, the team evaluated the impact of a Mediterranean-like lifestyle over the course of ten years in more than 110,000 participants located in the UK.\nThe scientists found that adoption of the Mediterranean lifestyle was indeed feasible and could be adapted to local contexts, such as availability of ingredients, their affordability, local culinary traditions, and food preferences. Participants were found to have lowered their risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease relative to the general population.\n\u201cWe found that the three blocks of the MEDLIFE were independently associated with lower [\u2026] mortality,\u201d explained Sotos-Prieto. \u201cAnd within block 3 [physical activity, rest, social habits, and conviviality] we found that participating in collective sports, limiting sedentary activities, and having adequate hours of sleep (6-8 hours) were associated with lower mortality.\u201d\nHowever, there were some variables that could not be taken into account due to a lack of information. This was the case for olive oil consumption, a prominent component of the Mediterranean diet previously associated with protective roles in many chronic diseases. \u201cIt is probable that we are underestimating the Mediterranean lifestyle association,\u201d said Sotos-Prieto.\nTo nap or not to nap?\nThe siesta, a brief afternoon nap, is a traditional habit in Mediterranean countries. But scientists are undecided as to whether it is a healthy practice.\nIn the current study, specific napping habits were found to be associated with higher risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease. However, and similar to the case of olive oil consumption, the researchers say they did not have detailed information on frequency and duration of naps or sleep structure, such as how often and for how long, which they say weakens their conclusion.\n\u201cMoreover, reverse causation is also possible, with people napping because of subclinical conditions or other chronic diseases (for instance, if they had more prevalence of sleep apnea), especially since napping faces a stigma in Anglo-Saxon countries,\u201d said Sotos-Preito.\n\u201dPrevious studies have found a J-shaped relationship \u2014 a smile-like curve \u2014 between napping and cardiovascular diseases,\u201d said Sotos-Prieto. This type of chart illustrates situations in which low values of one variable (in this case, a short nap duration) lead to a decrease in the values of the second variable (incidence of cardiovascular events), while the trend reverses at higher values.\n\u201cShort naps, which range from 0 to 30 minutes, were associated with lower incident cardiovascular disease,\u201d said Sotos-Preito. \u201cAn inverse association between short naps and mortality and cardiovascular diseases was found in our previous publications.\u201d\nWhen asked for a definitive answer as to whether napping was indeed beneficial or not, Sotos-Prieto indicated that more research is needed in this regard.\nAdapting to the lifestyle\nThe challenge remains in how to put these results into practice in other countries with different, deep-rooted customs. Cultural adaptation of beneficial practices is essential to make the Mediterranean diet and habits more appealing and practical for diverse populations in non-Mediterranean countries.\n\u201cOne way to start could be to emphasize the use of fresh, local products and ingredients in Mediterranean-style meals,\u201d said Sotos-Prieto. \u201c[But] changing dietary habits and lifestyle is a gradual process, and affordability is also an important question.\u201d\nOther questions remain as to how governments should invest in introducing new healthy habits, which ones should be given preference, and how much change is it enough to start seeing benefits.\nThe task is not simple since culture can define anything from ingredients and recipes to different social habits and work-life schedules.

(She was not involved in the study.)\n\"Although foods rich in added sugar may stimulate the feel-good chemicals in the brain and become habit-forming, sugar itself is not addictive in the way cocaine or another drug may be,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"Consuming sugar and then reducing or eliminating it from the diet will not result in withdrawal symptoms or side effects as would happen from a true addiction,\" she continued.\n\"Food cravings are complex and tied into not just the nutrition profile of a food, but also the emotions and learned behaviors around eating.\"\nAPPLE A DAY \u2014 AND 4 OTHER GREAT FALL FOOD CHOICES THAT ARE HEALTHY, DELICIOUS AND FUN\nEmotions, stress, overall metabolic health, sleep habits and learned feeding behaviors all shape people\u2019s food choices, behaviors and responses, Palinski-Wade said.\n\"A food craving or binge-eating is almost always tied to an emotional response,\" she said. \"Chronic dieting, food shame, food accessibility and even early childhood feeding experiences can all be tied back to food choices and disordered eating habits.\"\nAlthough she believes that no single food is addictive, Palinski-Wade acknowledged that foods that are high in added sugar or added fats tend to be associated with the strongest cravings and desire.\n\"These foods often trigger the release of feel-good chemicals such as dopamine in the brain, leading to cravings and potentially addictive-like eating behaviors,\" she said.\n\"As you consume more and more of these foods, you build up a dopamine tolerance, meaning that you will have to eat even more of this food to experience the same pleasure response,\" Palinksi-Wade said \u2014 which can contribute to the development of cravings and loss of control over eating behavior.\nMore research is still needed to fully understand the relationship between food and addiction, the experts all agreed.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nThe University of Michigan study was a review and compilation of many other studies' data, Freirich pointed out.\n\"Ideally, to see if the type of food made a difference, you could run a controlled study with people consuming one meal plan with ultra-processed foods and another with minimally processed foods and then measure their reactions \u2014 thoughts about food, rated enjoyment of food, cravings and dopamine levels,\" she said.\nThose who are struggling with disordered eating , binge-eating or uncontrolled food cravings should work directly with a therapist or registered dietitian experienced in eating disorders, Palinski-Wade recommended.\n\"They can help you to better understand your behaviors and emotions around food and improve your relationship with food so that cravings and addictive behaviors can decrease,\" she said.\nAdditionally, Freirich recommended filling the majority of meals with minimally processed foods , as consuming more of these may result in eating fewer ultra-processed foods.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Lastly, speak to a dietitian about how to get started on changing your diet for your personal health goals,\" she said.\nFox News Digital reached out to the University of Michigan researcher for additional comments.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-10-19 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":467}
{"title":"Republicans still don\u2019t know how to talk to young voters online","context":"## Republicans still don\u2019t know how to talk to young voters online\n\nRepublicans still don\u2019t know how to talk to young voters online Vivek Ramaswamy struggles to gain an edge in the face of TikTok trolls\nIn an appeal to younger voters, Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 who proposed raising the voting age to 25 \u2014 launched his TikTok presence with an endorsement from Jake Paul, the YouTuber turned boxer who built a content empire by marketing to children.\nRamaswamy is one of the only Republican politicians making an effort to connect with Gen Z and young millennials, a demographic that overwhelmingly supported Democrats in the midterm elections. Despite the popularity and growing influence of far-right creators online, Republican candidates have historically failed to engage young voters on social media, if they try at all.\nWhile Democratic politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. John Fetterman\u2019s social media campaign strategies set the blueprint for politicians seeking internet fame, Republicans have neglected to adopt the digital fluency required to secure the youth vote. As the 2024 election approaches, Republican candidates may again fall behind in mobilizing voters on social media platforms.\nRamaswamy is also the only Republican presidential candidate to engage with TikTok, and is one of the few in his party to even have an account. His Silicon Valley roots as a biotech entrepreneur and millennial upbringing set him apart from the other candidates, but he faces an uphill battle in convincing Gen Z to like him, much less show up at the polls. Though his videos receive hundreds of thousands of views, his comments are also overrun with sex jokes.\nAnnie Wu Henry, the digital strategist behind Fetterman\u2019s TikTok stardom, noted that younger voters who are very online tend to value raw, unfiltered authenticity. They don\u2019t see that in many older politicians, and especially not in the Republican party.\n\u201cGen Z does not put up with bullshit,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThat\u2019s so much of what platforms like TikTok and Twitch cater to, and why they thrive on those platforms, because you can just pull out your phone and be talking while you\u2019re getting ready with the worst angle possible. Republicans in general, it goes against so much of how they act otherwise and young people know that.\u201d\nRamaswamy\u2019s TikTok strategy is puzzling; he appears to be trying to replicate the success of previous candidates who became social media stars over the course of their campaigns, but his TikTok presence conflicts with his own stances on social media and young voters. His communications director, Tricia McLaughlin, did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nLike many of his Republican colleagues, Ramaswamy has accused TikTok of being a threat to national security, and during a town hall days before he launched his account, described the platform as \u201cdigital fentanyl\u201d from China. He has also proposed barring anyone under 25 from voting, unless they serve in the military or pass a civics exam.\nHis first videos portray him as the one candidate who cares about America\u2019s youth. While his Republican colleagues have largely shunned TikTok, Ramaswamy is presenting himself as one of the Cool Politicians who will actually use it.\n\u201cWe have a generation of politicians that is badly out of touch,\u201d Ramaswamy said in his inaugural video, which did not describe his policy stances.\n@jakepaul Getting Vivek on Tik Tok because i believe our politicians of the future should connect with gen z and milennials on social where we all live and breathe. Its bizarre that in this day and age our presidents have no connection with us via social. Only the occasional tweets. Meet @Vivek Ramaswamy \u266c original sound \u2013 GenosPicks\nEstablishing himself as the millennial politician who\u2019s cool enough to use TikTok but anti-woke enough to play in the divisive culture war isn\u2019t working in Ramaswamy\u2019s favor, though.\nHis account, which has amassed over 50,000 followers in the weeks since he joined, has been barraged with comments either criticizing his positions or trolling him. He\u2019s been the butt of Gen Z\u2019s relentless comments about getting off to his content (the top comments on his videos are consistently jokes about edging). He also incited the wrath of witchtok creators, who filmed themselves casting hexes upon him and other conservatives.\nRamaswamy is raking in TikTok engagement \u2014 even if it\u2019s not how he intended \u2014 but Democrats are still dominating the Republican party in digital strategy. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Instagram Stories garnered her nationwide popularity when she campaigned in 2018, reaching further than her local constituency. In the years since, Democratic campaigns have increasingly prioritized social media strategy, establishing politician-influencers who wield content for votes.\nA 2022 midterm report by the Alliance for Securing Democracy found that in the Senate races, 47% of Democratic candidates had TikTok accounts, compared to 12% of Republican candidates. Of the major party House candidates, 30% of Democrats and 10% of Republicans were on TikTok, which as a platform was most prevalent in gubernatorial races.\nThough opposition to TikTok has been bipartisan, the crusade to ban the platform over national security concerns is primarily led by Republicans at the state level \u2014 a position that likely factors into the party\u2019s social media struggles with young voters.\nMehmet Oz, one of the few Republican candidates on TikTok, had the advantage of already having a large social media following when he announced his candidacy thanks to his popularity as Dr. Oz. But his TikTok presence consisted of reformatted TV ads, rants attacking his opponent, now-Senator Fetterman, and unrelatable videos that inadvertently portrayed him as wealthy and out of touch.\nThere have been Republican outliers who managed to build significant followings, but so far, none have managed to turn their social engagement into votes the way Trump\u2019s Twitter account did in 2016. Pennsylvania Sen. Doug Mastriano shunned traditional media during the race, instead relying on Facebook Live to build a far-right grassroots network that secured him the Republican nomination in the state\u2019s most recent gubernatorial race. He still lost to Josh Shapiro, whose campaign focused on reaching young voters through collaborations with Gen Z for Change, visiting college campuses and posting updates on BeReal.\nThere\u2019s clearly an audience for right-wing ideology online, as conservative influencers continue to build massive platforms, largely by provoking outrage. On Twitch, debate streams between creators across the political spectrum are wildly popular, and between May 2021 and May 2022, the site\u2019s Politics tag tripled in viewership. The platform itself is a haven for some figures on the far-right who have since been kicked off of YouTube.\nRepublican politicians, however, have failed to establish the rapport with young voters that their Democratic counterparts have. While X, the site previously known as Twitter, has become a conservative incubator, Republican politicians haven\u2019t taken advantage of the platform the way far-right influencers have.\nThat gap in digital fluency is most apparent in the way politicians approach new platforms. In 2020, Ocasio-Cortez encouraged viewers to vote in the upcoming presidential election by inviting the most popular streamers to play the pandemic\u2019s most popular game on her newly launched Twitch channel. Her \u201cAmong Us\u201d stream, which featured creators like Pokimane, Hasan Piker, Corpse Husband, Mxmtoon and other Twitch celebrities, was one of the most viewed streams in the site\u2019s history. Ocasio-Cortez has hosted multiple wildly successful streams since, from charity fundraising streams to discussing labor issues with viewers.\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) famously struggled with his own Twitch debut. Last year, he launched his channel with a 30-minute diatribe about the January. 6 Capitol riot, featuring former Trump speechwriter Darren Beattie. The stream peaked at just six live viewers. He left his chat room open when he finally went offline, which allowed Twitch users to bombard his channel with ASCII dicks. Between walls of lewd \u2014 but incredibly creative \u2014 text art, users bashed Gaetz and encouraged other viewers to read about the allegations of sex trafficking against him. (The Justice Department ultimately concluded its investigation without charging Gaetz.)\nLooks like Matt Gaetz foray into streaming on Twitch is working out pic.twitter.com\/S4GEDbgu8v \u2014 The Serfs (@theserfstv) September 30, 2022\nPlatform culture matters\nTo engage with users online, politicians must understand the culture of the platform. The streamers who appeared on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s stream brought their own fans, who may not have been politically engaged at all before their favorite creator introduced it to them. As a regular gamer herself, the representative is also up to date on the most popular games on Twitch; in 2020, it was \u201cAmong Us,\u201d but in her most recent stream, she played the cooperative puzzle game \u201cPico Park.\u201d Gaetz, on the other hand, fumbled his launch by treating his stream like a podcast recording, limiting the back-and-forth banter with viewers that makes Twitch so engaging.\n\u201cThe amount of media and content that we consume, political and cultural, where people get their information \u2026 It\u2019s getting more and more intertwined,\u201d Henry said. \u201cTo be effective ideologically, when it comes to campaigns and these wins that we want, we have to understand how these ecosystems work, and be strategically using them or else we risk being left behind.\u201d\nEngaging with voters online requires more than just working with popular creators. In Ramaswamy\u2019s case, an endorsement from Jake Paul only drove animosity from TikTok viewers. While his older brother, Logan Paul, has made the occasional social commentary on his podcast, the younger Paul has rarely engaged with politics or social issues. Jake Paul is generally disliked online for the running list of allegations against him, including sexual assault accusations.\nThe Paul brothers have a reputation of promoting anyone and anything for a paycheck, and when Jake Paul posted a political endorsement out of the blue, viewers immediately questioned how much Ramaswamy paid him.\nEven if Jake Paul was less despised online, endorsements aren\u2019t as valuable as they used to be. A paper published in the International Journal of Communication this year reported that mobilizing influencers to build support for political causes is more effective than using their endorsements to gain votes. Blatant endorsements lack personal connection, and create an \u201cauthenticity gap.\u201d Authentic creators are trustworthy, and in campaign strategy, that\u2019s more valuable than the size of their following.\nMartin Riedl, a University of Tennessee, Knoxville professor who studies social media and co-authored the paper, said that society tends to reward public figures for speaking out on social justice issues because there\u2019s more \u201csituational awareness.\u201d\n\u201cIf you use influencers in your campaign, it\u2019s important that they can authentically believe in what you promote,\u201d Riedl said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s not the case, that makes it really difficult for people to take your campaign seriously.\u201d\nAuthenticity reigns\nFacebook ads, celebrity endorsements and campaign trail rallies aren\u2019t enough to engage voters online. Neither is recycling press releases as posts. To keep up with the evolving culture, candidates are expected to be content creators as much as they are politicians, regardless of the social media platform they\u2019re using. Authenticity is currency online, even if it\u2019s manufactured by a team of strategists. Candidates don\u2019t need to have the innate knack for posting for successful campaigns, Riedl said, as long as they hire someone who does.\nGen Z voters are particularly resistant to flagrant pandering, and quick to shut down any forced pop culture reference as cringe. Cringe exists across party lines \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go to the polls\u201d still haunts the internet \u2014 but candidates don\u2019t need to rely on youth culture to build followings.\nMemeing throughout his campaign worked for Fetterman, Henry said, because that dry humor aligns with his background as \u201ca guy from rugged Pennsylvania\u201d who \u201cdoesn\u2019t try to act cool.\u201d Ken Russell, a Democrat who left the Miami City Commission to run for a House seat in 2022, leaned into the cringe with bait-and-switch thirst traps reminding viewers to vote. In another video titled \u201cAppealing to the youth vote,\u201d he recreated Steve Buscemi\u2019s \u201cHow do you do, fellow kids?\u201d to encourage voter registration.\nAudience engagement doesn\u2019t rely on forcing fun. North Carolina Rep. Jeff Jackson updates constituents on TikTok, breaking down topics like the government shutdown in concise explanatory videos without the frills of internet humor. Even though his content is less exciting, his account has over 2.2 million followers.\nAs an alternative to the politician-influencer, some campaigns are focusing on mobilizing creators who already have an engaged audience. Biden is not on TikTok, but his digital strategy team is building an \u201carmy of influencers\u201d to reach viewers who wouldn\u2019t typically keep up with the White House press corps. White House deputy chief of staff Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon told Axios that the administration is trying to not only reach young people, but \u201cpeople whose main way of getting information is digital.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be directly on the platform, having surrogates \u2014 whether those be influencers, celebrities, normal people \u2014 do the messaging, that\u2019s likely going to be reaching people at a more personal level anyway,\u201d Henry said.\n\u201cEveryone has a vested interest, for the most part, in what the president of the United States has to say, but if it\u2019s your friend, if it\u2019s this person you\u2019ve followed for five years, you have a vested interest that\u2019s a little bit more personal. Usually that\u2019s more effective.\u201d\nThe \u201cinfluencer army\u201d strategy could be legally and ethically murky when influencers are paid to spread political messaging, potentially skirting both federal campaign ad laws and platform rules. TikTok bans political ads, and in recent elections, cracked down on posting sponsored political content. Influencer marketing agencies on both ends of the political spectrum are ramping up their recruitment faster than the Federal Elections Commission can regulate the industry. This year, the conservative agency Influenceable has been recruiting Gen Z creators to rally behind far-right politicians and parrot GOP talking points, without disclosing their pay. The tactic irked some Republicans, the Texas Tribune reported, including a Texas state representative who called for an investigation into the company.\nGiven the resistance to Republican politicians in online spaces that attract young people, it\u2019s unsurprising that candidates may rely on shadowy agencies like Influenceable to do the work for them. Republican politicians have a reputation for botching even the most straightforward digital campaigns. In May, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis launched his presidential campaign on Twitter Spaces in an audio conversation with Elon Musk. The conversation started late and was so riddled with technical issues that it ended after just 21 minutes. Critics on both the right and the left described the launch as a disaster.\nConservative organizations have proven especially out of their depth when facing the wrath of extremely online social media users, who mobilize trolling for social justice. In 2020, TikTok users reserved hundreds of tickets for a Trump rally and never showed up, leaving the president to face swaths of empty seats. When a Texas anti-abortion group opened an anonymous tip form to enforce the state\u2019s ban on abortion after six weeks, Gen Z activists flooded the site with Shrek porn. This year, TikTok and Twitter users shut down the Missouri attorney general\u2019s tip form for reporting clinics that provide gender-affirming care. Within days of launching, the site was spammed with fanfiction, satirical anecdotes about kids getting \u201ctransed\u201d and fanfiction. The attorney general\u2019s press secretary blamed the site\u2019s downfall on activists \u201chacking the system.\u201d\nThe presidential election is more than a year away, but it may be too late for Ramaswamy to make any headway on TikTok, where the platform\u2019s young users still don\u2019t take him seriously. He recently posted a video about getting ready for the next Republican debate, and was hit with yet another wall of edging comments.\nEven if candidates like Ramaswamy did everything right \u2014 like having a platform that didn\u2019t alienate young voters and working with creators with more favorable reputations \u2014 they\u2019d still represent a party that many Gen Z and millennial voters aren\u2019t aligned with.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to be effective with a generation when a lot of your policy is attacking them,\u201d Henry said. \u201cIf all of your policy is highly unfavorable for that generation, that\u2019s a hard sell in itself, even if you\u2019re an effective communicator with all the strategy in the world, to sell someone something they don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Morgan Sung, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-02 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":468}
{"title":"Gag City is a viral win for Nicki Minaj","context":"## Gag City is a viral win for Nicki Minaj\n\nWelcome to Gag City, the pink metropolis inhabited by stans and brands alike.\nIn the days leading up to the release of \u201cPink Friday 2,\u201d Nicki Minaj\u2019s fifth studio album and sequel to her debut record \u201cPink Friday\u201d that dropped on Friday, Twitter was flooded with AI-generated images of pink-toned cityscapes. Gag City, the dreamy false utopia ruled by Minaj and her Barbz, broke through stan Twitter and became a viral meme that brand accounts immediately used for their own marketing \u2014 promoting Minaj\u2019s album for free.\nIs it an authentic stan-led campaign to build hype for Minaj? Is it a plant to game engagement for both the album and brands? What\u2019s clear is that the viral moment is a win for Minaj, manufactured or not.\nIt started in September, when Minaj teased the album\u2019s cover art online. The image features Minaj on a pink subway car, drifting through pink clouds with a futuristic (and obviously, pink) city skyline in the background.\nShe and her Barbz started referring to the album\u2019s release as \u201cGag City,\u201d NBC News reports, referencing gay slang for being so amazed that you\u2019re at a loss for words. One might be gagged by witnessing a stunning outfit change, or by listening to a perfect record, like \u201cPink Friday 2.\u201d Leading up to the release, stans started posted AI-generated images of a pink concrete jungle, joking that fictional characters and celebrities were arriving to Gag City in anticipation of Minaj\u2019s album. In one of the first, posted on December 1 according to Know Your Meme, a fan account shared an image of a pink plane labeled \u201cGagg City\u201d flying over a similarly pink skyline.\nIn the days before the release, Minaj told fans to \u201cprepare for landing\u201d and teased a description of her pink utopia. Barbz replied with AI-generated renditions of the descent into Gag City.\nLois Griffin, Marge Simpson, and Linda Belcher have arrived in Gag City pic.twitter.com\/ZIjqtPdhZu \u2014 Fin (@gofinurself) December 7, 2023\nBREAKING: Starbucks lemon loaf has arrived in Gag City pic.twitter.com\/KY68wp1Ocu \u2014 benji (@basicbenny) December 7, 2023\nnot the homophobic dog arriving in Gag City?! pic.twitter.com\/vYMBgm4vd4 \u2014 JB \ud83e\udea9\ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf49 (@JBfromDC89) December 7, 2023\nfun fact: katy perry is actually the first artist that ever recorded a music video in gag city (2010) pic.twitter.com\/ZIMZ59fuiS \u2014 fazpo\ud83e\uddad (@fazpo) December 7, 2023\nX (formerly Twitter) users began crafting elaborate narratives about Gag City\u2019s inhabitants and government. One posted an image of Barbz storming the Pink House, which another user described as the fandom\u2019s own January 6th. Another posted an image of pink-clad citizens protesting in the streets of Gag City, calling for Minaj to release the album\u2019s track list. Though some may believe that Gag City is a utopia, one account posted an image of a matronly Minaj handing out CDs of her album to impoverished children \u201con the outskirts of Gag City,\u201d implying that the pink society also has a class divide problem.\nGag City is also riddled with stan wars, as fans of rival pop stars posted images of their faves vying for Minaj\u2019s seat at the head of her city\u2019s government. In a nod to Greek mythology, one account posted an image of a Trojan horse decorated in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d disco motif.\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING: The Barbz have discovered a mysterious, metallic horse at the front gates of Gag City.

Chili\u2019s posted an image of rosy smoke billowing from its restaurant, which makes me wonder if air pollution exists in Gag City. Wheat Thins, Baskin-Robbins, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Pizza Hut, Red Lobster, Oreo, Bing (??), the Empire State Building and countless others posted their versions of Gag City.\nOn one hand, memes tend to die the minute brand accounts start co-opting them \u2014 nothing is more tiresome than seeing a fun joke turn into a corporate-friendly marketing ploy. AI-generated images are already ethically fraught, and critics have raised concerns over AI generators trained on artwork without the consent of the work\u2019s artists. Artists have also criticized brands for using AI-generated art instead of commissioning work from a real, human artist. Though using AI-generated art for commercial use is legal, as copyright laws pertaining to AI are virtually non-existent, it\u2019s generally seen as a shitty move by many in the art world.\nOn the other, it\u2019s free promotion for Minaj, and as a lifelong Barb who spent her adolescence running a stan account for \u201cPink Friday,\u201d I consider it a win.\nNicki Minaj is an artist who\u2019s been embroiled in controversy throughout her career, from posting bad takes about COVID vaccines to defending her husband Kenneth Petty, a convicted sex offender. She may be a brilliant artist, but her problematic history makes her far from the family-friendly public figure that brands are more likely to endorse.\nBut with Gag City, Minaj has brands doing all of her marketing for her. \u201cPink Friday 2\u201d is an artistic marvel in itself (though I am probably biased), but the free promotion that it\u2019s been getting as a viral meme is particularly astounding. Artists have spent the last few years trying to drum up engagement for their work by making their songs trend on TikTok, which audiences have started to resist. Gag City doesn\u2019t bank on being the viral song of the summer to drive streaming numbers \u2014 the bit is removed enough for non-stans to enjoy it, while still revolving around the album it\u2019s promoting.\nBrand Twitter tends to turn fun trends into advertising opportunities, taking organic community interactions and spitting out contrived versions clearly made to go viral. It may be grating, but in this case, it\u2019s working in Minaj\u2019s favor.

Not only does it earn easy-to-use cash back (at an abnormally high rate), but its redemption options are equally straightforward.\nPros Unlimited 1.67% return rate on all purchases\nSimple rewards structure\n$0 annual fee Cons No welcome offer\nNo bonus spending categories\nYou must already be a Fifth Third customer to qualify\nFifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card: Overview\nAPR:\nIntro: 0% introductory APR with balance transfers for the first 12 billing cycles after account opening. (After that, your APR will be 20.74%\u201329.99% based on your creditworthiness.)\n0% introductory APR with balance transfers for the first 12 billing cycles after account opening.

It\u2019s got a fixed 1.67% earning rate on all purchases with the option to redeem for either a direct deposit or a statement credit on your card. This super-simple approach may be a big draw for some\u2014but it can be a deterrent for others. Its one-dimensional approach means that it\u2019s impossible to get outsized value for your rewards.\nMany credit cards tack on up to 3% of your total overseas spending. The Fifth Third 1.67% Card waives these foreign transaction fees, so it\u2019s a good companion for international trips. It also doesn\u2019t charge an annual fee, which means it can continue to benefit your credit profile even if your credit card strategy evolves away from using the card regularly. A big factor that makes up your credit score is \u201clength of credit history,\u201d which is determined by the average age of your accounts. By keeping the card open, your length of credit history will grow even if you don\u2019t use it (though you should swipe it once every six months to avoid account closure due to inactivity).\nFifth Third is a bank that operates primarily in the Midwest\u2014but it has branches from Illinois to West Virginia to Florida. If you don\u2019t live in an area where it has physical locations, you may likely have never heard of it.\nHere\u2019s why that\u2019s important: If you don\u2019t have a Fifth Third checking or savings account, you\u2019re ineligible to open the Fifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card. Only those with a previous relationship with the bank will qualify.\nFifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card: Rewards\nThe Fifth Third 1.67% Card offers a unique fixed return rate for all purchases: 1.67% uncapped. Sounds random, but it ties in with the bank\u2019s \u201cFifth Third\u201d motif (5\/3 = 1.67). This is an above average return for a no annual fee cash back credit card with a flat earning rate. More common are offers between 1% and 1.5%.\nThe card technically earns \u201cRewards Points,\u201d that can be redeemed at a rate of 1 cent per point. When you make a purchase, your points earnings will be rounded (up or down) to the nearest whole number. For example, if you spend $6, you\u2019ll earn 10.02 points. This will be rounded to 10 points.\nDoes Fifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card offer a new customer bonus?\nThe Fifth Third 1.67% Card doesn\u2019t currently offer a welcome bonus to new members.\nHow to redeem Fifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card rewards\nWhen it comes to using your rewards, the Fifth Third 1.67% Card doesn\u2019t have many tricks up its sleeve.\nStatement credit\nWhen you earn points with the Fifth Third 1.67% Card, you can use them toward a statement credit on your card to offset your balance. You can do this immediately after the rewards are posted to your account.\nMany cash back credit cards require you to earn a specific amount before you\u2019re eligible to redeem them ($25 is a common threshold). This card does not.\nDirect deposit\nAlternatively, you can request a direct deposit into your Fifth Third checking or savings account if you don\u2019t currently have a balance on your credit card, or if you\u2019d like to use your funds in some way other than lowering your credit card debt.\nAutomatic redemptions\nIf you want to spend as much brain power redeeming your points as you do earning them (i.e., none), you can enroll in auto-redemption which will empty your full rewards balance into your account each month.\nAdditional benefits\nThe Fifth Third 1.67% Card\u2019s ongoing benefits aren\u2019t jaw-dropping, but few no annual fee cash back credit card benefits are. Here\u2019s what you can expect:\nCell phone protection: If your cell phone is lost or stolen, you\u2019ll receive up to $800 per claim (maximum two claims or $1,000 per 12-month period) with a $50 deductible. All you\u2019ve got to do is use the card to pay your monthly phone bill. This is excellent for a no annual fee credit card.\nIf your cell phone is lost or stolen, you\u2019ll receive up to $800 per claim (maximum two claims or $1,000 per 12-month period) with a $50 deductible.

Mastercard ID Theft Protection: Mastercard will monitor the internet (including the dark and deep web) to find any of your sensitive information, including compromised credentials. This is a benefit that all Mastercard credit cards customers have.\nIs the Fifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card right for you?\nIt\u2019s true: Many other credit card rewards programs have a higher potential value than the Fifth Third 1.67% Card. Earning airline miles, hotel points, or transferable rewards that can be converted to travel loyalty programs can literally be worth exponentially more. The caveat is that these programs take a lot of research and experimentation to maximize.\nThe Fifth Third 1.67% Card is for those who don\u2019t have a master\u2019s degree in credit card rewards\u2014and aren\u2019t interested in putting in the effort. With this card, you can guarantee that you\u2019ll get a solid return every time you swipe the card. There are no catches (except perhaps the fact that you must have a Fifth Third checking or savings account to qualify).\nCredit cards similar to Fifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card\nThere are plenty of other cash back credit cards that can compete with the Fifth Third 1.67% Card, many of which don\u2019t require you to have a previous relationship with the bank to secure an approval. Here are some of the best credit cards to consider if the Fifth Third 1.67% Card just isn\u2019t doing it for you.\nCapital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card vs. Fifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card\nThe no annual fee offers an unlimited 1.5% cash back return. This is slightly below the Fifth Third 1.67% Card, but it makes up for the deficit in other ways.\nFor example, you\u2019ll earn 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. You\u2019ll also earn $200 after spending $500 in the first 3 months from account opening. The card even offers six months of free Uber One membership through Nov. 14, 2024 (otherwise $9.99 per month).\nCiti\u00ae Double Cash Card vs. Fifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card\nThe no annual fee earns 1% back when you make a purchase and 1% back when you pay off that purchase. That\u2019s 2% everywhere, which is notably higher than the Fifth Third 1.67% Card.\nThe card doesn\u2019t earn a welcome bonus. And its benefits are comparatively slim. For example, it doesn\u2019t waive foreign transaction fees and it doesn\u2019t offer cell phone insurance. If the extra 0.33% in earnings doesn\u2019t offset these shortcomings, the Fifth Third 1.67% Card is likely your better option.\nFrequently asked questions\nIs the Fifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card worth it?\nThe Fifth Third 1.67% Card is worth it for anyone who values simplicity above all else. It\u2019s got a solid return rate for all purchases\u2014and because it doesn\u2019t incur an annual fee, you\u2019re guaranteed to make a profit (as long as you stay away from other fees like APR and cash advances).\nHow does a Fifth Third cash back card work?\nThe Fifth Third 1.67% Cash\/Back Card offers a fixed 1.67% return for all purchases. You can redeem them as a direct deposit into your Fifth Third checking or savings account, or you can request that a statement credit be applied to your card.\nWhat is the APR for the Fifth Third 1.67% Card?\nThe Fifth Third 1.67% Card comes with a 20.74%\u201329.99% variable APR.\nPlease note that card details are accurate as of the publish date, but are subject to change at any time at the discretion of the issuer.

With a $0 annual fee, it offers a flat cash back rate on all purchases, and there\u2019s no limit on how much you can earn in rewards.\nPlus, it offers new cardmembers 15 months at 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers completed within the first 60 days of opening an account, giving you more than a year to make payments without interest.\nHowever, the card isn\u2019t particularly useful if you travel often. It charges foreign transaction fees, and it lacks the travel benefits that other cards offer.\nAmerican Express Cash Magnet\u00ae Card: Rewards\nUsing the Cash Magnet Card to earn rewards is simple: you\u2019ll earn an unlimited 1.5% cash back on every purchase you make. The only transactions you won\u2019t earn rewards on are the following:\nBalance transfers\nCash advances\nPurchases of traveler\u2019s checks\nPurchases of prepaid cards or reloading card balances\nPerson-to-person transfers, such as Venmo transactions\nOne important thing to note: American Express doesn\u2019t allow cardholders to earn rewards during a billing period if the cardmember hasn\u2019t paid the minimum payment due by the due date.\nDoes American Express Cash Magnet\u00ae Card offer a new customer bonus?\nIf you are a new customer, you can qualify for a $200 statement credit if you spend $2,000 in the first 6 months of card ownership. Once you\u2019ve reached the spending threshold, American Express will credit the $200 to your account as a statement credit. However, it can take eight to 12 weeks after reaching the spending requirement to receive the credit.\nThe bonus on the American Express Cash Magnet\u00ae card is relatively low\u2014it\u2019s possible to find cards without annual fees that offer higher bonus amounts\u2014but the bonus offer gives customers more time to reach the spending threshold.\nMany cards require cardmembers to reach the spending threshold within three months, so unless you spend a significant amount of money each month with your card, you\u2019re unlikely to reach the spending requirement.\nWith the American Express Cash Magnet\u00ae card, you have six months to reach the spending threshold. Even if you only use the card for routine expenses, such as utility bills, streaming services, gas for your car or groceries, you could likely reach the spending requirement within six months and earn the $200 cash back bonus.\nHow to redeem American Express Cash Magnet\u00ae Card cash back rewards\nIf you have the American Express Cash Magnet\u00ae card, you can redeem your cash back rewards for statement credits to your account.\nThere is no minimum required to redeem rewards. Rewards will be in the form of a statement credit of $1 for every reward dollar you redeem. For example, if you have 50.50 reward dollars, you can redeem those rewards for a $50.50 statement credit.\nStatement credits will be applied to your account within three days, but statement credits cannot be used toward the minimum amount due. Unless the statement credit reduces your balance to $0, you\u2019re still required to make the minimum payment.\nAdditional benefits\nCompared to the benefits of other credit cards, the American Express Cash Magnet\u00ae Card is more limited. However, it does offer the following perks:\nAmerican Express Experiences: With American Express Experiences, you get access to exclusive ticket pre-sales and cardmember-only events.

With no annual fee and 1.5% cash back on every purchase, it\u2019s a no-frills, no-hassle addition to your wallet.\nBut if you love to travel, you\u2019ll likely need another credit card. Other options offer more comprehensive travel benefits, such as reimbursing you for TSA PreCheck fees or travel interruption\/cancellation insurance, and you can find other cards that don\u2019t charge foreign transaction fees.\nCredit cards similar to American Express Cash Magnet\u00ae Card\nIf the American Express Cash Magnet\u00ae Card isn\u2019t the best choice for you, consider these alternatives:\nAmex Blue Cash Everyday vs. \u200b\u200bAmerican Express Cash Magnet\u00ae Card\nThe Blue Cash Everyday\u00ae Card from American Express is similar to the American Express Cash Magnet\u00ae Card in its fees and APR offers, but it has a different rewards structure.

But it has a very different rewards system than the Amex card; rather than earning a flat cash back rate, you can earn 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in combined quarterly purchases in various categories throughout the year (then 1%).\nIt takes a little more work to take advantage of rotating spending categories. But if you tend to spend money in the different categories\u2014such as restaurants, Amazon purchases or gas\u2014you could earn more cash back rewards with the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back card. Plus, Discover will match all of the cash back you earned during your first year as a cardmember.\nFrequently asked questions\nIs the Amex Cash Magnet Card hard to get?\nAmerican Express doesn\u2019t disclose its minimum credit score requirement for its cards. But generally, you need to have good credit\u2014according to Equifax, that means you need a score of 670 or higher\u2014to qualify for the Amex Cash Magnet Card or other American Express cards.\nAmex does have a card pre-qualification tool you can use to find out the likelihood of getting approved without affecting your credit score.\nWhat is the limit on the Amex Cash Magnet Card?\nSome cards list their minimum spending limit in their terms and conditions, but American Express doesn\u2019t list the minimum for the Cash Magnet Card.

{"title":"Could CRISPR cure HIV someday?","context":"## Could CRISPR cure HIV someday?\n\nScientists have been experimenting with how to use CRISPR to treat and potentially cure HIV since the gene-editing tool was developed.\nIn an ongoing clinical trial , researchers are testing whether just one dose of a new gene therapy that might effectively cure human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infections is safe in humans.\nThe therapy, named EBT-101, involves using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to treat HIV. This potential treatment strategy has been studied in animal models since the development of CRISPR-Cas9 in 2012. However, this is the first time such a gene-editing treatment for HIV has been tried in humans. The latest data from the trial suggest that EBT-101 is safe at the doses tested, but we don't yet know if it cures HIV.\nAccording to the United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS (UNAIDS) , approximately 39 million people globally were living with HIV in 2022, and there were about 630,000 AIDS-related deaths that year, making HIV a continued public health burden. There is no vaccine or easily accessible cure for HIV, although a handful of people have been effectively cured through intensive stem-cell transplants.\nThe EBT-101 trial \"is an important step forward in the development of this technology to treat human disease and infection, including HIV,\" Thomas Hope , a professor of cell and developmental biology at Northwestern University who was not involved in the work, told Live Science in an email.\nBut how likely is it, really, that we could use CRISPR to cure HIV someday?\nRelated: We could end the AIDS epidemic in less than a decade. Here's how.\nHow CRISPR could (theoretically) cure HIV\nHIV infects immune cells that are normally used to fight infection in the virus's host. The virus uses an immune cell's machinery to insert its own DNA into the host's genome, allowing the virus to replicate. If an HIV infection is not treated, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which results in a severely weakened immune system and leaves the infected person highly vulnerable to other infections, cancers and early death.\nCombination antiretroviral therapies (cARTs) are the mainstay in HIV treatment and limit the virus' replication, thus extending people's lives to near-normal lengths and cutting their chance of spreading HIV . However, these therapies must be taken for a lifetime and fall short of being a cure .\n\"The existing challenge in HIV treatment lies in the virus creating resilient genetic reservoirs within human cells,\" Elena Herrera-Carrillo , an associate professor of infectious disease at Amsterdam University Medical Centers, told Live Science. Herrera-Carrillo's lab focuses on using CRISPR to edit cells that harbor HIV reservoirs, despite ongoing cART therapy. This phenomenon is known as \"latent HIV\" and occurs when the virus infects a type of immune cell called CD4+ memory T cells, which can persist for decades .\ncART therapies can suppress viral replication, but if the treatment is interrupted, \"the dormant proviruses can reactivate, making a cure elusive,\" Herrera-Carrillo told Live Science.\nCRISPR works by targeting and cleaving specific sequences of DNA from the genome; a \"guide\" leads CRISPR's famous \"molecular scissors\" to the targeted gene. This either deactivates the gene or allows it to be removed and swapped for different DNA. Research groups believe this strategy could be effective in removing latent HIV infections, because it can target the viral DNA embedded in the genome, rather than only stopping replication.\nUsing CRISPR for HIV gene therapy has shown promise in several test-tube studies, a 2020 review in The Journal of Clinical Investigation notes. Various groups have been working to bring the therapies from test tubes to human patients \u2014 and that brings us to EBT-101.\nRelated: The world's 1st CRISPR therapy has just been approved. Here's everything you need to know\nHIV infects immune cells in the body. (Image credit: KATERYNA KON\/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)\nAll about EBT-101\nAccording to a recent presentation at the annual meeting of the European Society for Gene and Cell Therapy in Brussels, EBT-101 uses multiple guides to target multiple sites in the genome and snip out large sections of latently integrated HIV DNA. This stops HIV from replicating.\nKamel Kahlili , a professor of neurovirology and gene editing at Temple University and co-founder of Excision BioTherapeutics , has been working with the company to develop EBT-101 for a decade. In 2020 and 2023 , Khalili and his team published reports that showed that EBT-100, a precursor to EBT-101, safely targeted and removed HIV DNA in infected primates.\nNow, they're testing their EBT-101 targeting strategy in humans in an early-stage clinical trial that primarily focuses on the safety of the treatment. Initial results from three treated patients showed no toxic effects or serious adverse events. All of the patients' HIV is currently suppressed with cART.\n\"The initial safety results are promising because no adverse outcomes have been observed to date,\" said Hope, whose lab studies the mechanisms behind HIV infections. \"But more time is needed to be sure because of the way genetic off-target mutations can take years to manifest into complications,\" he added.\nOff-target effects of CRISPR refer to when the CRISPR molecule alters DNA at sites other than those targeted. These unintended snips have long been a worry for researchers designing CRISPR treatments, so they'll be something to watch for with EBT-101, especially since the treatment targets multiple sites in the genome .\nAdditionally, experts told Live Science that even though the ongoing trial hints that the therapy has a positive safety profile, we still don't know whether one dose can effectively target latent HIV cells and whether it can control HIV in humans.\n\"It is crucial to approach this with caution,\" Herrera-Carrillo said. \"While optimism about being on the right track is justified, it's important to recognize the substantial work that still needs to be done.\"\nThe clinical trial will next test additional doses of EBT-101 for safety and then determine whether the virus stays suppressed when patients are taken off cART. cART therapies pump the brakes on HIV replication, so the only way to determine whether the latent cell reservoirs have been disabled is to temporarily lift those brakes.\nInterruptions to HIV treatment are necessary to determine whether a patient is in remission \u2014 as has occurred in the few people cured of HIV \u2014 but in general, purposeful treatment interruptions have been debated due to their inherent risks.\nFollowing these tests, EBT-101 trial participants will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up study for 15 years following their initial dose to check for long-term adverse effects. So the data is on its way, but will take years to arrive.\n\nThis article was published by Live Science: The Most Interesting Articles on 2023-11-30 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":472}

{"title":"Will the Panthers fire Frank Reich? Impatient David Tepper could turn up Carolina's hot seat with 'Thursday Night Football' loss","context":"## Will the Panthers fire Frank Reich? Impatient David Tepper could turn up Carolina's hot seat with 'Thursday Night Football' loss\n\nThe Panthers entered the 2023 NFL season shrouded in optimism. The team had moved on from Matt Rhule, who proved to be an ineffective NFL coach, and added a potential franchise quarterback to the fold in Bryce Young.\nThe hope was that those moves would turn Carolina into a contender in the wide-open NFC South.\nInstead, they find themselves not only at the bottom of the division but also sporting one of the worst records in the NFL at 1-7.\nYoung hasn't yet looked comfortable in the Panthers' offense, and he is coming off one of his worst games as a starter against the Colts. He threw three interceptions in that contest, including two pick-sixes to Kenny Moore in a 27-13 defeat.\nMORE: Full list of rookie quarterbacks to start an NFL game in 2023\nThe rest of the Panthers' offense hasn't been much better. Adam Thielen has looked rejuvenated in his new home, but running back Miles Sanders has been a bust acquisition. And the team's offensive line has allowed 74 pressures on the season, good for the 10th-most in the NFL.\nIndeed, Carolina's offense has been less-than-impressive in 2023. That's the main reason that coach Frank Reich finds himself under fire for the team's performance.\nReich already gave up play-calling to offensive coordinator Thomas Brown after the team's early-season struggles. Now, there are questions about whether the team's lackluster offense \u2014 which averages the fifth-fewest yards (283.4) and sixth-fewest points (17.5) per game this season \u2014 could ultimately cause owner David Tepper to move on from Reich after just one season.\nWill the Panthers fire Frank Reich?\nThe Panthers aren't guaranteed to fire Reich even amid their poor season. But as ESPN's Adam Schefter implied on \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" the retread coach's seat is growing hotter with each passing week.\n\"I don't think anybody's got a long rope there just because of the type of season that they're having,\" Schefter said when asked about Reich's status in Carolina.\nSchefter stopped short of saying that Reich was on the hot seat. However, he detailed that owner David Tepper wouldn't be afraid to move on from Reich if he deemed it necessary for the success of his team.\n\"One thing about David Tepper: he's not very patient,\" Schefter said. \"He's as successful as he is because of the way he's operated his business. And it's worked for him, basically at every level. He does what he wants. And I don't think that people are thinking that there's trouble right now with those people. But would anybody be surprised with anything that happens in Carolina this year? No.\"\n\"One thing about David Tepper is he's not very patient and he does whatever he wants..\n\nI don't think anybody would be surprised if anything happens in Carolina with the season that they're having\" ~ @AdamSchefter #PMSLive pic.twitter.com\/PV7bfVUtHp \u2014 Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) November 6, 2023\nSchefter pointed to Carolina's firing of Rhule as an example of Tepper's impatience. There had been rumors that the owner was going to wait things out with Rhule in the weeks leading up to his in-season departure. Instead, he decided to pull the trigger and part with him.\nWhile Reich isn't guaranteed to meet the same fate, it's becoming clearer that he will need to deliver some wins to help earn a second season in charge of the Panthers.\nAnd as Schefter notes, the team's \"Thursday Night Football\" game against the Bears may be among the most important games remaining on Carolina's schedule, as the team grapples with justifying the trade-up to select Young.\nLet's keep in mind, [the Panthers] play the Bears Thursday night. The Bears have their No. 1 draft pick. So if the Bears win on Thursday, that's a huge victory and in a bigger way than just the game itself.\nAgain, that's not to say that Reich will be fired after Thursday's game. After all, he might not be fired at all if he can help Carolina to earn some wins during the second half of the season.\nBut if Tepper loses his patience with Reich, he could go back to the drawing board and bring another new head coach aboard.\nMORE: Panthers' Bryce Young over C.J. Stroud decision comes under fire after Stroud's record-setting day\nFrank Reich coaching record\nReich has posted a winning record of 41-40-1 in his 81 career regular-season games as a head coach. This is despite the fact that the Panthers have posted a record of just 1-7 under his watch this season.\nThe reason for this is that Reich had a solid four-plus-year stint with the Colts. He had three winning seasons during his five campaigns in Indianapolis and totaled a record of 40-33-1 with the team despite dealing with numerous changes at the quarterback position.\nBelow is a year-by-year breakdown of Reich's record with the Colts and Panthers.\nYear Team Record 2018 Colts 10-6 2019 Colts 7-9 2020 Colts 11-5 2021 Colts 9-8 2022 Colts* 3-5-1 2023 Panthers 1-7 Total Colts\/Panthers 41-40-1\n* Fired after Week 9 of the season.\nReich made it to the postseason in two of his first three seasons with the Colts. The team posted a record of 1-2 in three contests across those two appearances.\nIt's also worth noting that Reich has had a different Week 1 starter at quarterback in each of his first six seasons as a head coach. He was hoping to break that streak with Young in Carolina, but he will need to first make it to a seventh season with the club.\n\nThis article, authored by Jacob Camenker, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-06 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":474}
{"title":"No. 17 Arizona dominates No. 22 Utah, 42-18","context":"## No. 17 Arizona dominates No. 22 Utah, 42-18\n\nSaturday\u2019s game between Arizona and Utah was many things for the Wildcats: Senior Day, Military Appreciation Day, and their last home game of the season. With the UA needing a win to keep its own destiny alive for a Pac-12 Championship appearance, it handled the pressure once again against a ranked team.\nThe Wildcats not only got halfway through en route to winning out but did it in statement fashion Saturday at Arizona Stadium in front of a sold out stadium, blowing out No. 22 Utah, 42-18, extending their winning streak to five games, as well as marking their first win over the Utes since 2015. It is also the first time the UA took down four ranked teams in a season since 1989, with it being the only team in the country this season to do so.\n\"Great win for the program,\" Arizona head coach Jedd Fisch said following the win. \"Great win for our team, great win for our seniors, great win for Tucson, appreciate Tucson coming out in full force, selling out the stadium. ... I think you might as well put the season tickets on sale for next year on Monday and see if we can get six sell outs.\"\nLeading the Wildcats was junior safety Dalton Johnson, logging 11 tackles as well as two tackles for loss in the UA\u2019s routing.\n\"Dalton is a fantastic tackler,\" Fisch said. \"When he's around the ball, he gets them down.\"\nAfter failing continuously on trick plays involving receiver Tetairoa McMillan passing behind the scrimmage this season, Arizona head coach Jedd Fisch designed it again \u2014 this time to perfection \u2014 with McMillan finding a wide-open fifth-year senior Michael Wiley to score a touchdown in his last game in Tucson.\nFollowing the trickery, another huge roar of the Wildcat faithful ensued following a blocked punt and score by Anthony Ward, the first Arizona blocked punt and score since Nov. 13, 2021.\nThe Wildcats\u2019 momentum was rolling like a well-oiled machine on both ends of the ball in the first half, scoring offensive touchdowns on three of four drives, led by Michael Wiley tallying two of them, and outgaining the Utes by 98 yards on the ground, as well as forcing the Utes to two three-and-outs, three punts and a red zone interception, headlined by captain linebacker Jacob Manu, the first Arizona linebacker interception since Anthony Pandy against USC in 2021. With rain starting to pour late in the first half in a rare Arizona \u201crain game\u201d, the overcast didn\u2019t hinder the Zona Zoo from leaving the stadium, nor the Wildcats from letting up their progression, resulting in the UA taking staggering 28-7 lead at halftime.\n\"I don't think the rain effected us at all,\" Fisch said.\nWith the rain starting to clear up to start the second half, overtime it was clear that the Wildcats\u2019 defense was holding a cloud over the Utes\u2019 heads. Arizona got off to a slow start but picked up much of its thunderous momentum after junior safety Gunner Maldonado broke up a pass on fourth and three. Since the fourth-down stop, the UA logged an interception and another turnover on downs.\nAlthough the defense was surging, the Wildcats not scoring since the first drive of the second quarter \u2014 their offense seemed to have lost its touch.\nBut then \u201cSwag Surfin\u201d by Fast Life Yungstaz came on, signaling the fourth quarter, the quarter in which going into the game, Arizona was outscoring opponents 90-37. The Wildcats on their first drive put a touchdown on the board a seven play, 61 yard drive, thanks to a 25-yard dash before diving into the end zone by running back Jonah Coleman. The UA then ran away from the Utes, outscoring them 14-8, only allowing a garbage time touchdown in the last minute to secure its 8th win of the season.\nThe last touchdown for Arizona came with backup quarterback Jayden de Laura hitting McMillan for a 51-yard touchdown.\n\"I wanted Jayden to go out with a touchdown pass this season,\" Fisch said. \"I think that he deserves that.\"\nWhen asked about whether the win against Utah, who has beat the Wildcats the last six meetings, signified anything further about the program, Fisch said that the win signified that they are having a great year.\n\"[It signifies] that we're not gonna back down from anybody, and we feel really good about trying to continue to improve, get more physical, get tougher,\" Fisch said.\nFor fifth-year senior captain Jordan Morgan, who missed his opportunity last season to play in Senior Day last season due to injury, the Tucson native noted that being able to compete and win in his final game at Arizona Stadium \"means so much.\"\n\"I finally got to finish off with a bang like this at home for the last time in my career, so really enjoyed it,\" Morgan said.\nArizona (8-3, 6-2 Pac-12) will take on its in-state rival Arizona State (3-7, 2-5) next Saturday for the 97th annual Territorial Cup.\n\"I think our team will be very excited for the game against ASU,\" Fisch said. \"There won't be a question about that. We understand the importance of the game, we want to keep the Territorial Cup here in Tucson and our guys recognize that, understand that and we will put all of our focus starting tomorrow at 9 a.m.\n\nThis article, authored by Aidan Wohl, GoAZCATS.com, was published by Rivals on 2023-11-18 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":475}
{"title":"Gabriel Jesus\u2019s sublime goal and assist gives Arsenal vital victory in Sevilla","context":"## Gabriel Jesus\u2019s sublime goal and assist gives Arsenal vital victory in Sevilla\n\nIn the end they were made to resist, but Arsenal are back on top. On a night when Mikel Arteta said his side were forced to play many games in one, controlling when it was called for, holding on when they had to and slipping in the knife when the opportunity arose, the very last kick and the chance to have the last word fell to the Sevilla striker Lucas Ocampos.\nWith the clock on 97 minutes, the hosts 2-1 down and the ball sitting up, he could have changed everything. Instead he sliced past David Raya\u2019s left hand and into the stand, leaving his team facing the prospect of another Europa League adventure and their opponents\u2019 future in the continent\u2019s premier competition in their own hands.\nAs Ocampos sat on the turf, the S\u00e1nchez-Pizju\u00e1n fell quiet, except for the 3,000 Arsenal fans high in the corner who had watched what their coach described as another step in this team\u2019s development, \u201ca brutal experience\u201d. This, he said, was a victory of merit; it was a demonstration too of the emotional management he had demanded, with Declan Rice and William Saliba among those who impressed. Though none shone brighter than Gabriel Jesus.\nUltimately, two grand moments from the Brazilian either side of half\u2011time did it: the first an exceptional assist that broke the game open in the blink of an eye, the second the shot that flashed past \u00d8rjan Nyland and into the far corner. Asked afterwards which was better, Arteta replied \u201cboth\u201d, adding: \u201cI would like to see a replay of the first in slow motion because it was so sharp. He came for a reason: this is our level now and we need players like that.\u201d\nArsenal\u2019s opener came at the very end of the first half, when the game had begun to tilt slightly away from them and an initially timid Sevilla had started to think they could get a goal of their own. Instead, they found themselves sliced open. Superb footwork from Ocampos enabled him to get away from Bukayo Saka, nicking the ball through the England player\u2019s legs and running at the defence, space opening before him but Dodi Lukebakio\u2019s cross was cleared and Sevilla were suddenly exposed, stripped bare by Jesus.\nA lovely turn enabled him to evade two players and slide the ball into a huge gap. Dashing free was Gabriel Martinelli, alone from the halfway line. A long run to the goal, right through the middle, and Nyland came to him. It was the second time the two men had come face to face, the Norwegian denying Martinelli when he had been released by Jorginho after 10 minutes, but this time the outcome was different. Martinelli slowed, stepped around the keeper to the right and rolled the ball into an empty net.\nArsenal\u2019s Gabriel Jesus curls in a beautiful finish against Sevilla. Photograph: Kieran McManus\/Shutterstock\nWhen that first opportunity had been passed up, it didn\u2019t seem to matter much: at that point it had appeared Arsenal would open Sevilla again and often. They had stepped high and dominated the opening period. And yet Diego Alonso\u2019s side would settle, even if too often their moves ended at the feet of Lukebakio. It was he who missed their best early opportunity, failing to control by the penalty spot after the kind of loose Raya pass that can only fuel the goalkeeping debate had gifted Sevilla possession in a dangerous position.\nThe next chance came Sevilla\u2019s way too, Sergio Ramos stepping out from the back to find Ocampos who nudged it into the path of Youssef En\u2011Nesyri. Beyond the defence, his shot faded past the far post.\nIf Sevilla were encouraged forward by that, it proved to be their downfall right on the verge of half-time, and soon after the break they had conceded again. Jesus received on the left, cut inside Jes\u00fas Navas, stepped on to the sweet spot for a shot and bent a brilliant finish into the far corner.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A Nemanja Gudelj header from a corner put Sevilla back in it and then Mariano D\u00edaz, on as a substitute, brought the ball down on his chest and smashed a shot against the bar. Next came a overhead kick from Ocampos, going close; game on.\nSevilla were throwing what they could at Arsenal now. These were the moments Arteta had meant, stressing the importance of knowing that they will always come and having the capacity to withstand them. \u201cThese games demand you play lots of different games,\u201d he said. \u201cWe controlled it and created chances but at 2-0 we did not kill them off. We conceded from a corner and then we lacked control and had to defend our area, but we are very happy because we found those different things that are very important, and in a stadium where not many teams have won.\u201d\nIf he had warned his side, so had the fans in this arena, a huge banner unfurled at the start declaring: \u201cEurope knows what we are capable of\u201d. They were going to fight, that was for sure. On 90 minutes, En-Nesyri leapt to head. Raya then had to push away a wayward cross that almost sneaked in and Nyland was sent up for a corner until, in the very last second, the ball sat up before Ocampos. Sevilla though could not find a way through. Arsenal, top of Group B, now should.\n\nThis article, authored by Sid Lowe at the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium, was published by The Guardian on 2023-10-24 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":476}
{"title":"Attorney general going after Jeffrey Epstein's estate says she was fired for her dogged pursuit: 'My bar license, my integrity were more important to me'","context":"## Attorney general going after Jeffrey Epstein's estate says she was fired for her dogged pursuit: 'My bar license, my integrity were more important to me'\n\nSubject: The Epstein files. Message: Wrap them up \u2014 ASAP.\nOne after another, the texts, calls and emails rolled in.\nDenise George knew from the beginning that she was going up against powerful players on Wall Street over their supposed links to Jeffrey Epstein. But she soon sensed that she was also up against forces here at home, in the US Virgin Islands, where the financier seemed to have preyed on women and girls with impunity.\nPeople in St. Thomas wanted the Epstein scandal \u2014 and the uncomfortable questions it was raising \u2014 to go away, and fast. But George says she needed time. She was fired as attorney general after spending more than three years trying to seek justice.\nCorrespondence about the case obtained by Bloomberg News underscores the sense of urgency within the local government and the pressure George came under. Hundreds of pages of court documents offer a window into details about Epstein\u2019s web of influence in the US territory.\nGeorge was the driving force behind three high-profile legal battles involving Epstein, the Svengali who courted a wide circle of rich and powerful men \u2013 from Bill Gates to Prince Andrew \u2013 even after he was branded a sex offender.\nOn this rain-drenched Tuesday in the Caribbean, George is telling her story about those landmark cases, which reverberated like a thunderclap through the power corridors of business and politics. Even now, four years after Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that a code of silence, a sort of omerta, hangs over his affairs here.\nGeorge, 64, is sitting inside a poolside restaurant at a flamingo-pink hotel, overlooking the rooftops of St. Thomas. It\u2019s mid-summer in the tropics, low season here. The place is empty. On the silver chain round her neck hangs a gift from her husband: a pendant in the shape of the scales of justice.\nEpstein\u2019s estate was the first to settle with the Virgin Islands. A year ago, it agreed to pay $105 million, plus half the proceeds from the sale of Little St. James, AKA \u201cLittle St. Jeff,\u201d the private island where authorities allege some of Epstein\u2019s crimes took place.\nThen, last January, Wall Street billionaire Leon Black settled for $62.5 million. Next came JPMorgan Chase., in September, for $75 million. None of the parties admitted to wrongdoing. All of them declined to comment for this story.\nWithout those cases, the world may have never glimpsed some of the secrets Epstein and his circle harbored, or the depths of his influence here in the Caribbean. Emails that surfaced in the litigation, for instance, revealed Epstein\u2019s unusually close relationship with Jes Staley, a top banker at JPMorgan Chase & Co. who went on to run Barclays Plc.\nJPMorgan had alleged in court that Staley failed to alert the bank of all he knew about Epstein. Staley \u2013 who swapped sexually suggestive emails about young women with Epstein and visited Little St. Jeff, according to emails filed in court \u2014 hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing by the authorities. Lawyers for Staley claim he had no decision-making authority over Epstein\u2019s JPMorgan accounts.\nIn a nutshell, George\u2019s story behind these stories is this:\nShe felt pressure from the territory\u2019s governor to quickly settle the Epstein cases and move on. To George, the message was clear: Bury the Epstein scandal once and for all.\n\u201cIt was very professional but we did have very different values and that created a lot of contention between us throughout the course of the Epstein investigation and other matters as well,\u201d she said.\nAfter George was dismissed last December, Governor Albert Bryan Jr. was clear: He was eager to put the entire scandal behind the US Virgin Islands.\n\u201cIf we never mention Jeffrey Epstein again, that would be good for me,\u201d Bryan told The St. Thomas Source. At the time, his office said George\u2019s dismissal was unrelated to her pursuit of JPMorgan. But Bryan later said he couldn\u2019t have an attorney general launching lawsuits he didn\u2019t know about. His office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThis much is sure: Over all the years Epstein sex-trafficked and sexually abused dozens of underage girls and young women, he projected money and influence through Virgin Islands as if the territory were his private fief.\nHe cultivated politicians, donated heavily to campaigns and forged close ties with a powerful and well-connected local law firm. Cecile de Jongh, wife of one of Bryan\u2019s predecessors as governor, John de Jongh, even worked for Epstein. She served as his office manager and unofficial political emissary. Mrs de Jongh declined to comment for this story.\nDuring her deposition as part of the JPMorgan litigation, Mrs de Jongh was asked about seeking enrollment in English classes for women at Epstein\u2019s request. She said she never saw anyone under distress and \u201cwould never do anything to harm anyone, or aid and abet anyone in harming someone.\u201d\nEpstein lobbied to relax rules that were imposed on him as a sex offender, with mixed success. He also received $300 million in tax breaks from the territory\u2019s Economic Development Commission, some of them while now-Governor Bryan was EDC chairman. Neither Bryan nor any other official has been accused of any wrongdoing.\nWeb of Influence\nEpstein spun his web influence over the islands in order to protect himself and hide his dark secrets, George says.\nDespite the lurid record and all the stories surrounding Epstein, George says she wasn\u2019t aware of the scale of his crimes when she was named attorney general in 2019, less than two months before Epstein was arrested at New Jersey\u2019s Teterboro Airport after flying from Paris.\nIt didn\u2019t take her long to find out. She was only a few weeks into the job when news reporters began calling. They wanted to know if authorities in the US Virgin Islands were investigating what Epstein had been up to for all those years on Little St. Jeff.\nThey weren\u2019t.\nAround the same time, Governor Bryan, who was sworn in in 2019, told George that Epstein had made a request: He wanted a new waiver to loosen certain restrictions placed on him as a convicted sex-offender, according to court filings. Epstein, for instance, had to give the Virgin Islands 21 days\u2019 notice when he planned to travel.\n\u201cIn my head I am thinking, Relax?\u201d George recalls. \u201cIf anything, wouldn\u2019t you say, Tighten them?\u201d\nA previous attorney general had granted such a waiver but later it had been revoked. Epstein wanted a new one, George testified during a deposition earlier this year.\nGovernor Bryan told her that Epstein\u2019s lawyers would be in touch, she said. They happened to work for Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin, according to the former prosecutor, the same local firm that supported his gubernatorial campaign.\nErika Kellerhals, who requested the waiver on Epstein\u2019s behalf, had hosted a $1,000-a-head fundraiser for Bryan along with partner Greg Ferguson in 2018. Ferguson later was appointed to Bryan\u2019s transition committee for economic regulation, according to a local press report.\nGovernor Bryan texted George in May 2019, she testified in a deposition, telling her to make a decision. She denied Epstein\u2019s request.\nGeorge later testified that she thought Epstein was \u201cflexing his political influence over or with the governor\u201d rather than going through the usual channels.\nGiven Epstein\u2019s apparent influence in Virgin Islands, who would want to rock the boat? George says she was willing to try. Around St. Thomas, she has a reputation as a straightshooter. The former public-corruption attorney stops short of pointing to official wrongdoing. But on this sticky August day, in her gold-buttoned blazer, she makes clear that she, for one, wouldn\u2019t tolerate it.\n\u201cIf I have to lose my job to avoid being part of a conspiracy to cover something up, I would do it,\u201d George says. \u201cMy bar license, my integrity were more important to me. I wasn\u2019t going to compromise that.\u201d\nWhen Epstein was found dead a few months later in his cramped Manhattan jail cell, George saw an opening. Epstein had quietly set up a trust in the Virgin Islands as a repository of his personal fortune, valued at $577 million at the time of his death. George decided to go after the estate and those who might have helped Epstein.\n\u201cHe is dead,\u201d she thought to herself, \u201cbut his accomplices must be alive.\u201d\nThe law firm representing the estate: Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin, the same one Epstein had used for years here, and the same one with connections to Governor Bryan. In court filings, the firm quickly blasted the Virgin Islands for sitting on its hands while Epstein was alive.\nKellerhals did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe governor gave his blessing when George indicated she wanted to launch a civil enforcement action against the estate. But the tone shifted when the litigation dragged on into a second year.\nPrivately, Bryan expressed frustration. He wanted to know why it was taking so long to settle with Epstein\u2019s estate.\nGeorge claimed the civil racketeering case was complex and warranted a resolution that at least in part met Epstein\u2019s myriad of wrongdoings in the USVI. In the end the estate returned $80 million in tax incentives, agreed to pay half a million to remediate environmental damage to one of Epstein\u2019s islands, committed half the proceeds from the future sale of Little St James and established a victims\u2019 compensation fund.\nOfficially, George, not the governor, was in charge of making the legal calls. But Bryan was still her boss and held the purse strings. It was a delicate balance, George said.\nTrying to untangle a half-billion-dollar estate is a formidable task under the best of circumstances. It was even harder given the code of silence still surrounding the dead financier. Many of Epstein\u2019s employees had signed nondisclosure agreements. Some alerted the estate\u2019s lawyers the moment investigators reached out. On Little St. Jeff, groundskeepers avoided eye contact when authorities approached.\nGeorge herself traveled to Little St. Jeff. She still can\u2019t shake eerie absurdity of seeing a dentist\u2019s chair inside the luxury island villa.\nIn the end, the Epstein estate settled. The other battles would soon follow.\nGeorge didn\u2019t get much time to celebrate. Four weeks after that deal was struck \u2013 and four days after George filed the suit against JPMorgan \u2013 the official news arrived from the Office of the Governor.\nIt was New Year\u2019s Eve. George was cooking callaloo, Caribbean greens, at her father\u2019s house. A security officer arrived at the door and handed her a letter.\nDenise George, the 16th attorney general of the US Virgin Islands, had been summarily dismissed.\n\nThis article, authored by Ava Benny-Morrison, Bloomberg, was published by Fortune on 2023-11-17 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":477}
{"title":"Tottenham\u2019s Unbeaten Run Ends With 4-1 Home Loss to Chelsea","context":"## Tottenham\u2019s Unbeaten Run Ends With 4-1 Home Loss to Chelsea\n\nNine-men Tottenham suffered their first loss of the Premier League campaign in a fiery 2-1 defeat at home to Chelsea.\nJackson rifled in a 75th minute winner from Raheem Sterling\u2019s square-ball pass as the Blues came from behind to win at manager \u2013 Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s former home ground \u2013 with the Argentinean having managed Spurs between 2014-19.\nThe Senegal forward then struck twice in injury time to claim his first hat-trick as a Chelsea player and wrap up a clinical victory.\nDejan Kulusevski had earlier put Tottenham ahead in the sixth minute but Cole Palmer equalised from a 35th minute penalty, after Cristian Romero had been red carded for a foul on Enzo Fernandez.\nThe hosts\u2019 disastrous evening worsened with injuries to Mickey van de Ven and James Maddison, whilst Destiny Udogie was sent off in the 55th minute for a second bookable offence.\nSpeaking to BBC post-match, Tottenham manager, Ange Postecoglou said: \u201cThere was a fair bit going on, a lot of VAR intervention, a hard game for me to analyse but I am very proud of the players. Right to the end they were trying to create something for us.\n\u201cThe players couldn\u2019t give any more than they did, part of this game is will, effort and determination and they showed that.\u201d\nTottenham now sit second in the table, whilst Chelsea\u2019s win lifted them up to tenth on goal difference from fellow London rivals, Crystal Palace.\nEmbed from Getty Images\nHaving slipped to second in the table over the weekend, Tottenham started with high energy and fluidity which saw Pape Matar Sarr play Son Heung-min through in the fifth minute, but the South Korea international saw his shot saved by Robert Sanchez.\nThat chance proved to be an early warning which Chelsea failed to heed as Sarr flicked on a sixth-minute diagonal pass for Kulusevski, who calmly rifled into the near-right corner to put Tottenham back top of the table at that point.\nPedro Porro almost doubled Spurs\u2019 lead a minute later as he rifled upon goal from Kulusevski\u2019s pullback pass of Brennan Johnson\u2019s cross, yet Sanchez was able to make a comfortable save.\nChelsea\u2019s first chance eventually came in the 11th minute as Jackson forced a save from Guglielmo Vicario, before Son briefly extended the hosts lead two minutes later with a tap-in but he was ruled offside via his right shoulder position.\nTottenham soon afterwards began to lose their composure and Romero was lucky not to be sent off in the 21st minute, after he retaliated with a kick on Levi Colwill following an initial shove on the Argentinean.\nSterling meanwhile scored for Chelsea amidst that incident seconds later but his goal was ruled out for handball, after his first shot rebounded off Porro onto his right arm before he put the ball away beyond Vicario.\nSterling though had found himself the subject of a reckless tackle from Udogie two minutes earlier, with the Italian getting away with a yellow card.\nFernandez and Thiago Silva then saw shots go wide for Chelsea but tensions soon hit boiling point in the 28th minute, as Moises Caicedo had an equalising goal disallowd due to Jackson interfering with play as the Colombian delivered his shot upon goal.\nRomero meanwhile clipped Fernandez inside the box with a high-footed challenge which sent his compatriot to ground, and resulted in a red card for the Spus defender following a lengthy VAR review and referee \u2013 Michael Oliver awarded Chelsea a penalty.\nPalmer eventually stepped up in the 35th minute and Vicario got a touch on the Englishman\u2019s penalty, yet could only deflect it onto the right post, which saw the ball ricochet into the bottom-right corner to pull the West London visitors level.\nChelsea quickly pushed on after their equaliser against an imploding Spurs defence but failed to find a breakthrough goal before half-time, whilst the hosts lost Romero\u2019s central defensive teammate \u2013 Mickey van de Ven to injury alongside James Maddison in two huge blows.\nTottenham however were lucky to not be down to nine men at the break after Sarr and Colwill came to blows in the tenth minute of injury time, yet Oliver decided to just yellow card both players than send either player off.\nReece James was then lucky not to be dismissed for Chelsea in the 11th minute of injury-time after he elbowed Udogie in the face, yet VAR deemed it a simple incident and not a yellow or red card offence.\nColwill though found himself hooked off at half-time by Mauricio Pochettino for Marc Cucurella, due to his ill-tempered first-half antics.\nUpon the restart, Chelsea quickly made their one-man advantage count but their recurring end product issues reared its head, as Palmer rifled wide in the 47th minute in a fast start from the Blues.\nSterling then broke forward seven minutes later but his shot was blocked by Vicario, before he seconds later broke forward on a counter-attack, which drew a foul from Udogie who was consequently dismissed to put Spurs down to nine men with 35 minutes left on the clock.\nIf Chelsea thought that decision boosted their prospects of a second goal then poor finishing looked to be their Achilles heel, as Jackson flicked over the bar from James\u2019 cutback pass following a short free-kick.\nJackson continued to push for his third goal of the campaign but his 58th minute shot was punched away by Vicario, when then blocked Palmer\u2019s rebound shot.\nChelsea continued to press and eventually got their reward as Sterling broke forward up the right flank at the start of the 75th minute, and found Jackson unmarked to rifle his pass into the left corner to put the Blues ahead at Pochettino\u2019s former team.\nTottenham however seemingly responded three minutes later as substitute, Rodrigo Bentancur flicked a free-kick behind for Eric Dier to volley into the top-left corner, but he was adjudged offside as Bentancur nodded the ball into his path.\nChelsea eventually clung on for a fourth league win of the season after Bentancur narrowly put a 86th minute header wide, as Spurs valiantly tried to chase an unsuccessful equaliser in which Son saw a 93rd minute shot denied by Sanchez.\nJackson subsequently rounded off Tottenham\u2019s nightmare evening a minute later as he turned Gallagher\u2019s pass into the net to seal a triumphant return to North London for Pochettino and his Blues, before he completed his hat-trick two minutes later.\nThe 22 year-old first turned in Connor Gallagaher\u2019s 94th minute pass followed by a clinical strike from Palmer\u2019s pass in the 97th minute, which secured Jackson his first Premier League hat-trick of his career.\nPostecoglou meanwhile suffered a first home defeat as a manager since he began his 52-match unbeaten home run in November 2020 during his time at Yokohama F. Marinos, then two-year spell at Celtic plus now Tottenham.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nTottenham continue their push for the Premier League title with a trip to Wolves on Saturday 11 November, with kick-off at Molineux set for 12:30pm GMT live on TNT Sport 1 in the UK.\nChelsea host Spurs\u2019 title rivals, Manchester City on Sunday 12 November at 4:30pm at Stamford Bridge, live on Sky Sports in the UK.\nTeam News\nTottenham: Guglielmo Vicario, Pedro Porro, Cristian Romeero, Mickey van de Ven (Hojbjerg 45+1\u2032), Destiny Udogie, Yves Bissouma, Pape Matar Sarr (Bentancur 61\u2032), Dejan Kulusevski (Skipp 61\u2032), James Maddison (Royal 45+1\u2032), Brennan Johnson (Dier 34\u2032), Son Heung-min\nSubstitutes: Oliver Skipp, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Richarlison, Bryan Gil, Emerson Royal, Eric Dier, Giovani Lo Celso, Fraser Forster, Rodrigo Bentancur\nChelsea: Robert Sanchez, Reece James (Gusto 77\u2032), Axel Disasi, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill (Cucurella 45\u2032), Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez, Cole Palmer, Conor Gallagher, Raheem Sterling, Nicolas Jackson\nSubstitutes: Marc Cucurella, Benoit Badiashile, Mykhailo Mudryk, Noni Madueke, Lesley Ugochukwu, Malo Gusto, Dorde Petroivic, Ian Maatsen, Deivid Washington\nReferee: Michael Oliver\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis article, authored by James Gregory, was published by Sport Grill on 2023-11-06 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":478}
{"title":"The housing winter arrives early as existing home sales crash to Great Recession levels and the long-feared \u2018deep freeze\u2019 sets in","context":"## The housing winter arrives early as existing home sales crash to Great Recession levels and the long-feared \u2018deep freeze\u2019 sets in\n\nAfter a long, hot summer that saw mortgage rates creep ever higher, October has brought an early winter for the housing market. Existing-home sales dropped a stunning 15% in September on a year-over-year basis to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million transactions, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). That\u2019s the lowest figure in 13 years, since 2010, when the world economy, and particularly the U.S. housing market, were struggling to pull out of the Great Financial Crisis.\nContributing factors to the continuous decline in home transactions include surging mortgage rates (which just hit 8% this week\u2014a record in the 21st century), low inventory levels, and home prices that refuse to stop rising. In other words, there aren\u2019t enough homes to buy, money isn\u2019t cheap anymore, and the ones for sale are too rich for most homebuyers\u2019 blood.\nIndeed, existing-home sales prices topped $306,000, a 5% increase since the year began, according to the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index.\n\u201cAs has been the case throughout this year, limited inventory and low housing affordability continue to hamper home sales,\u201d NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. \u201cThe Federal Reserve simply cannot keep raising interest rates in light of softening inflation and weakening job gains.\u201d The Fed has raised rates several times this year, with Chair Jerome Powell arming his \u201chigher for longer\u201d stance.\nDeclining housing inventory levels also contribute to the drop in housing transactions. Housing inventory is down 8.1% from this time last year, according to NAR. Some real-estate experts and economists argue that housing affordability is even worse now than during 2008, when a damaging downturn in the U.S. housing market set off the dominoes that became the Great Financial Crisis that defined a whole decade economically\u2014and in some ways, our current predicament.\nIn 2010, the last time existing home sales were so low, the global economy was on life support and the Fed slashed interest rates down to zero to revive the flatlining patient\u2014fueling an \u201ceverything bubble\u201d that inflated all kinds of assets along the way, not the least, housing. The zero-rate regime persisted until the highest inflation in 40 years surprised many economists and prompted the massive series of rate hikes that have brought us to the once-unthinkable 8% mortgage.\nSome onlookers saw what was coming, for instance Zillow, which warned in May that housing would enter a \u201cdeep freeze\u201d if the debt limit standoff failed to resolve and America defaulted, as that would send mortgage rates up to 8%. Of course, the default was averted, but here we have arrived at 8% mortgage rates anyway. But this isn\u2019t like 2008 or 2010 again. It\u2019s time for a 1980s history lesson.\nBack to the 1980s future\nThe housing market today isn\u2019t identical to that of the \u201880s, but it\u2019s pretty close. In a lot of ways, millennials are being forced to follow the housing journey of their boomer parents as they face a frozen, unaffordable market with rising interest rates, as noted recently by both BofA Research economist Jeseo Park and by First American chief economist Mark Fleming.\nEssentially, millennials are a giant generation all collectively coming of homebuying age nearly simultaneously\u2014just like their boomer parents in the 1980s. They\u2019re the \u201cbiggest share of the \u201chomebuying pie,\u201d as Redfin puts it, purchasing about 60% of homes bought with mortgages during the past few years.\nPlus, the raising of interest rates in an effort to combat inflation is strikingly similar to the \u201980s. Back then, Fed Chair Paul Volcker fought inflation through aggressive interest rate hikes, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage peaking at about 18% by late 1981. Sound familiar? Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell has set the tone for the most aggressive global hiking of rates in the modern era. And in due course, this week, mortgage rates hit 8%, the highest they\u2019ve been in more than 20 years.\nAll things considered, home sales activity also plummeted from 1978 to 1982. Existing-home sales dropped 50% during that period, according to the Office of Policy Development and Research. And while we haven\u2019t seen home sales activity levels this low since the 2000s, the housing market more closely mimics that of the \u201980s, according to a report published this week by Fortune 500 financial services company First American.\n\u201cToday\u2019s housing market isn\u2019t anything like the housing market of the mid-2000s,\u201d First American\u2019s Fleming wrote in a Tuesday report titled \u201c1980s D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu for the Housing Market.\u201d \u201cThe housing market today is not overbuilt, nor is it driven by loose lending standards, subprime mortgages, or homeowners who are highly leveraged.\u201d\nWhile some economic factors are stronger today than they were during the GFC, housing affordability is undeniably worse.\n\u201cWhile housing and more generally consumer fundamentals are in a much stronger position today, affordability for the incremental buyer is worse than it was at the peak in 2006 before the crash,\u201d Roger Ashworth, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a credit strategy research paper released last week.\nAnd he\u2019s not hopeful we\u2019ll see home prices drop anytime soon: \u201cAbsent any negative shocks to the broader economy that would either boost excess supply of homes on the market or fuel an uptick in unemployment, we continue to expect home prices to rise at a slow pace.\u201d In fact, he predicts we\u2019ll see home prices rise by 1.8% by the end of the year, with a 3.5% increase by the end of 2024.\nLooking at more recent housing inventory data makes the issue even more stark. Between September 2018 and September 2023, the average number of homes on the market dropped a whopping 60% to fewer than 700,000 active listings, according to Realtor.com.\n\u201cUnlike the turn of the millennium, house prices today are rising alongside mortgage rates, primarily due to low inventory,\u201d Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement released Sept. 29. \u201cThese headwinds are causing both buyers and sellers to hold out for better circumstances.\u201d\nBut with the development that home sales transactions are at their lowest level in the past 13 years coupled with century-high mortgage rates of 8%, many real estate experts and economists aren\u2019t hopeful that affordability constraints will let up soon.\nOut of fear of losing their lower interest rates, current homeowners are resistant to putting their homes on the market, ultimately leading to the abysmal inventory levels\u2014leaving fewer and fewer properties exchanging hands. Indeed, more than 90% of existing-home owners are locked into mortgage rates below 6%, Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American, previously told Fortune.\n\u201cThese homeowners do not have a financial incentive to sell,\u201d Kushi says. \u201cThe combination of reduced affordability and an even stronger rate lock-in effect suppresses home sales because you can\u2019t buy what\u2019s not for sale, even if you can afford it.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Sydney Lake, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-20 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":479}
