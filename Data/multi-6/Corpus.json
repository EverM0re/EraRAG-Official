{"title":"Deft is building e-commerce search to help you find the right product quickly","context":"## Deft is building e-commerce search to help you find the right product quickly\n\nE-commerce search startup Deft is releasing a multimodal search function for users to get better results. The company, which opened its service to beta users in May, has rolled out the new search experience so users don\u2019t have to describe the item in words.\nThe company is trying to solve the problem of finding the right item without spending hours looking for a product. Often users end up with subpar results while searching for products because their search query description won\u2019t match the details of listed items. The startup is relying on different techniques, including building its own parser and knowledge graph combined with large language models (LLMs) and multimodal search.\nDeft was founded in 2019 by Alex Gunnarson and Zach Hudson. Gunnarson started working on the idea after he couldn\u2019t find a specific type of couch online even after putting in different parameters and descriptions. It took him hours to find a perfect result for his search, so Gunnarson decided to build a solution with Hudson.\nUsers can go to Deft and search for things like \u201cwooden lamps with three legs under $400\u201d or upload an image, and modify their search to \u201clamps under $400 that look like this.\u201d While it\u2019s hard to know you can do this if someone doesn\u2019t tell you that it works, users can also paste the image directly into the search bar. The company is working on highlighting the image search feature better.\nThe company said that it doesn\u2019t just look at the listing and description for search results. It also looks at materials, reviews, photos and more. This way, when someone searches for a \u201cpet-friendly\u201d couch, Deft can return results with stain and scratch-resistant material.\n\u201cYou have companies like Google and Amazon that continue to push the most relevant listings down so they can make more advertising dollars.\u201d Zach Hudson\nDeft is currently focusing on furniture and home d\u00e9cor search but aims to expand to different categories along the way. The company has built its own scraping tech to add products to its search results. It shows results from Target, Pottery Barn and other places on the web. The company hasn\u2019t added searches from Amazon yet because it feels there are a lot of \u201cjunk\u201d listings on the site and it will take some work to clean up that data.\nHudson told TechCrunch that there are a few plaguing problems with the traditional search experience that prevent users from finding a suitable item.\n\u201cYou have companies like Google and Amazon that continue to push the most relevant listings down so they can make more advertising dollars. Some easy searches are now hard because marketers have learned how to game these search engines. Plus, now you have AI content that is putting the burden on users to separate fact from fiction,\u201d he said.\nThe company raised $1.8 million in a seed round from Hustle Fund, Frontier VC, Vitalize, Long Ecommerce Ventures, 43 Ventures and angel investors.\nThe startup said it is on track to hit 50,000 monthly active users by the end of this year. While co-founders didn\u2019t reveal the exact search volume the product is catering to, they said Deft is seeing \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of searches every week. They added that people using Deft for the second time do more searches than their first visit.\nThe team also noted that it has a conversion rate that is five times higher \u2014 a measure of people buying the product versus seeing it \u2014 compared to the standard e-commerce rate, which is around 2-3%, according to various estimates.\nDeft doesn\u2019t show ads on its platform. Rather, it relies on affiliate commissions to generate revenue. However, the startup wants subscriptions to be its primary revenue driver. Deft is currently testing two paid tiers: a $10 a month plan, which will offer better search customization to filter out some brands, and a $20 per month plan, which will enable personal shopping service, that will continue to look for suitable products even after you stop searching manually.\nUp next, Deft aims to release a browser extension that helps users search for products by the end of this year or early next year. In the next three years, the company wants to build and release search APIs that other e-commerce sites could use.\nChallenges of building a search startup\nGiven that it\u2019s building a search solution for e-commerce, Deft already faces challenges from Amazon and Google. In September, Amazon updated its visual search feature that lets users snap a photo of a product and search for similar items on the platform. Google released its multi-search feature last year that lets users fuse images and text. Separately, Deft will also face competition from other startups like Objective, a Matrix Partners-backed startup building an API platform for multimodal search.\nCaroline Casson, a partner at Vitalize Venture Capital and an investor in Deft, believes the startup has an edge because of its knowledge graph for products.\n\u201cBuilding a robust e-commerce search engine is incredibly complex on the backend. The extensive knowledge graph that Deft has built combined with AI search capabilities makes for a high-quality user experience. We were excited about early iterations of the product when we invested and we continue to be impressed with each product enhancement,\u201d Casson told TechCrunch over email.\nAdii Pienaar, another investor, and co-founder of WooCommerce, which was acquired by Automattic, told TechCrunch over a call that he sees Deft as solving user experience problems.\n\u201cOver the last couple of years, consumers have been trying out new ways to interact with and purchase products. I see Deft as creating a new kind of UX for purchasing,\u201d he said.\nStartups like Neeva \u2014 which was founded by former Google execs \u2014 tried to convince people to switch to paid and private search with additional features. However, earlier this year, the startup shut down its consumer efforts and eventually got acquired by Snowflake.\nPienaar said that Deft has to give compelling reasons to users to switch to its service.\n\u201cUsers\u2019 natural behavior for search is to follow the path of least resistance, i.e. most people just pick up their phone and just use the default search engine. For Deft to change that behavior, they will need to create a high-value proposition,\u201d he said.\nAmir Konigsberg, an investor and founder of e-commerce search startup Twiggle (which shut down), said his startup wanted to solve ChatGPT-type interactions in the shopping world. He said that the main problem for startups in this space is the go-to-market strategy and fundraising.\n\u201cThe problem with competing with e-commerce players is not just about user experience, it\u2019s also about logistics infrastructure and supply chain. So a startup catering to consumer search has to invest a lot of money into making it a viable business,\u201d Konigsberg told TechCrunch.\nHe also added that it will be difficult for a startup like Deft to build user loyalty while competing against Google and Amazon.\nBoth Pienaar and Konigsberg said that Deft will have to involve retailers in the mix either as partners or as customers of their search product. Either way, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see if Deft can build a user base on its own or sell its search feature to e-commerce retailers.\n\nThis article, authored by Ivan Mehta, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-03 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":301}
{"title":"The Blueprint of Regeneration: Scientists Discover How to Turn Stem Cells\u2019 Fate","context":"## The Blueprint of Regeneration: Scientists Discover How to Turn Stem Cells\u2019 Fate\n\nHow Do Intestinal Stem Cells Know Their Destiny? What Triggers Stem Cells to Repair Our Intestines? New Research Offers Answers\nWhat Tells Intestinal Stem Cells to Regenerate? New Study Explains\nStem cells have the remarkable ability to transform and replenish dying or injured cells. Yet, the process by which they select their cellular identity in particular scenarios remains a puzzle.\nThe research team led by Bon-Kyoung Koo at IMBA, in collaboration with the Institute for Basic Science, has pinpointed a previously unknown gene, Daam1. This gene is critical for activating the formation of secretory cells in the intestines.\nThis breakthrough, documented in the November 24 issue of Science Advances, heralds a new chapter in the understanding of cancer.\nMuch like automobiles that require constant maintenance to remain operational, our bodies rely on the continual renewal of cells to sustain organ function. Such regeneration is made possible by adult stem cells native to the tissues, which, unlike their embryonic counterparts that can become any cell type, are programmed to only replace the specific types of cells in their respective tissues.\nDetermining how these cells are guided to develop into specific tissue cells has been a key question. Gabriele Colozza, a postdoctoral researcher with Bon-Kyoung Koo at IMBA\u2014currently directing at the Center for Genome Engineering at the Institute for Basic Science in South Korea\u2014took on this challenge by delving into the mechanisms that direct intestinal stem cells.\nIntestinal stem cells\n\u201cIn our intestines, cells are exposed to extreme conditions,\u201d comments Colozza.\nHere, cells face harsh conditions due to factors like mechanical stress, digestive enzymes, and fluctuating pH levels. To counteract this, stem cells within the intestinal lining constantly evolve into new cells to replace those that are damaged.\n\u201cUncontrolled stem cell proliferation may lead to tumor formation; on the other hand, if too many stem cells differentiate, the tissue will be depleted of stem cells and ultimately unable to self-renew.\u201d\nThis intricate balance is maintained through a complex network of signaling pathways and regulatory feedback loops that enable intercellular communication. A crucial player in this process is the Wnt signaling pathway, a well-established mechanism in embryonic growth.\nHowever, without proper regulation, an overstimulated Wnt pathway may result in abnormal cell proliferation and, consequently, tumor development.\nHow Is the Fate of Intestinal Stem Cells Determined?\nRnf43 is a known regulator that tempers the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway, a role initially discovered by Bon-Kyoung Koo. Previously, Rnf43 was recognized for its ability to flag the Wnt receptor Frizzled for destruction.\n\u201cWe wanted to know how Rnf43 works, and also what \u2013 in turn \u2013 controls Rnf43 and helps it to regulate Wnt signalling,\u201d explains the research team.\nIt was understood from past studies that Rnf43 could not effectively degrade Frizzled by itself, which is embedded in the cell\u2019s plasma membrane.\n\u201cIn our project, we used biochemical assays to identify which proteins interact with Rnf43.\u201d\nThey discovered that the protein Daam1 is a crucial collaborator with Rnf43.\nTo probe the influence of Daam1 on Rnf43 and the tissue systems they influence, Colozza utilized intestinal organoids.\n\u201cWe found that Daam1 is required for Rnf43 to be active, so for Rnf43 to regulate Wnt signaling at all. Further work in cells showed Rnf43 needs Daam1 to move the Wnt receptor Frizzled into vesicles called endosomes. From the endosomes, Frizzled is shuttled to the lysosomes where it is degraded, dampening Wnt signaling,\u201d Colozza elaborates.\nIntestinal organoids, which are three-dimensional cultures derived from adult stem cells, replicate the environment of the intestinal lining. For Colozza, these organoids were a window into how Rnf43 and Daam1 influence the intricate interplay between the renewal and differentiation of stem cells in the gut.\n\u201cWe found that when we knock-out Rnf43 or Daam1, the organoids grow into tumor-like structures. These tumor-like organoids keep on growing, even if we withdraw the growth factors they usually depend on, such as R-spondin,\u201d Colozza notes.\nWhat Tells Intestinal Stem Cells to Regenerate? Here\u2019s What a New Study Says\nActivating Paneth Cell Development\nUpon delving deeper into this research using mouse models, Colozza and team found something unexpected.\n\u201cWhen Rnf43 was missing, the intestines grew tumors \u2013 as expected. But when Daam1 was missing, no tumors grew. We were puzzled by this striking difference: how can the loss of factors in the same pathway, that behave similarly in organoids, lead to such different outcomes?\u201d\nUpon closer inspection of the intestinal samples, the team observed a proliferation of Paneth cells\u2014secretory cells known for producing growth factors like Wnt that prompt cell division\u2014in the intestines without Rnf43. Conversely, intestines deficient in Daam1 showed no such increase in Paneth cells.\n\u201cDaam1 is required for the efficient formation of Paneth cells. When Daam1 is active, stem cells differentiate to form Paneth cells. When Daam1 is not active, the stem cells differentiate into another cell type.\u201d\nTumor Growth Influenced by Cellular Environment\nThis finding helps to explain the contrasting outcomes observed in intestines and organoids.\n\u201cIn organoid culture, we scientists provide growth factors, so the knockout of both Rnf43 and Daam1 lead to tumor-like organoids. But in the intestine, there is no little scientist providing growth factors. Instead, Paneth cells provide growth factors, like Wnt, and create the right conditions for stem cells to survive and divide. When Paneth cells are lacking \u2013 such as when Daam1 is not active to drive cells into becoming Paneth cells \u2013 stem cells will not divide much. But when there are too many Paneth cells \u2013 such as in intestines lacking Rnf43 \u2013 the excessive growth factors can contribute to the formation of tumors.\u201d\nThe findings from Colozza and his team mark the first genetic evidence that Daam1, associated with the non-canonical Wnt pathway, plays a critical role in designating Paneth cell fate and the evolution of this key secretory cell type.\n\u201cWe show that tumor cells modify their microenvironment, and influence their supporting environment so that they can grow better.\u201d\nImage Credit: iStock\n\nThis article, authored by Puja Molpariya, was published by Revyuh Media on 2023-11-24 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":302}

{"title":"Meta turned a blind eye to kids on its platforms for years, unredacted lawsuit alleges","context":"## Meta turned a blind eye to kids on its platforms for years, unredacted lawsuit alleges\n\nA newly unredacted version of the multi-state lawsuit against Meta alleges a troubling pattern of deception and minimization in how the company handles kids under 13 on its platforms. Internal documents appear to show that the company\u2019s approach to this ostensibly forbidden demographic is far more laissez-faire than it has publicly claimed.\nThe lawsuit, filed last month, alleges a wide spread of damaging practices at the company relating to the health and well-being of younger people using it. From body image to bullying, privacy invasion to engagement maximization, all the purported evils of social media are laid at Meta\u2019s door \u2014 perhaps rightly, but it also gives the appearance of a lack of focus.\nIn one respect at least, however, the documentation obtained by the attorneys general of 42 states is quite specific, \u201cand it is damning,\u201d as AG Rob Bonta of California put it. That is in paragraphs 642 through 835, which mostly document violations of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA. This law created very specific restrictions around young folks online, limiting data collection and requiring things like parental consent for various actions, but a lot of tech companies seem to consider it more suggestion than requirement.\nYou know it is bad news for the company when they request pages and pages of redactions:\nThis recently happened with Amazon as well, and it turned out they were trying to hide the existence of a price-hiking algorithm that skimmed billions from consumers. But it\u2019s much worse when you\u2019re redacting COPPA complaints.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish and confident in our COPPA allegations. Meta is knowingly taking steps that harm children, and lying about it,\u201d AG Bonta told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cIn the unredacted complaint we see that Meta knows that its social media platforms are used by millions of kids under 13, and they unlawfully collect their personal info. It shows that common practice where Meta says one thing in its public-facing comments to Congress and other regulators, while internally it says something else.\u201d\nThe lawsuit argues that \u201cMeta does not obtain\u2014or even attempt to obtain\u2014verifiable parental consent before collecting the personal information of children on Instagram and Facebook\u2026 But Meta\u2019s own records reveal that it has actual knowledge that Instagram and Facebook target and successfully enroll children as users.\u201d\nEssentially, while the problem of identifying kids\u2019 accounts created in violation of platform rules is certainly a difficult one, Meta allegedly opted to turn a blind eye for years rather than enact more stringent rules that would necessarily impact user numbers.\nMeta, for its part, said in statements that the suit \u201cmischaracterizes our work using selective quotes and cherry-picked documents,\u201d and that \u201cwe have measures in place to remove these [i.e. under-13] accounts when we identify them. However, verifying the age of people online is a complex industry challenge.\u201d\nHere are a few of the most striking parts of the suit. While some of these allegations relate to practices from years ago, bear in mind that Meta (then Facebook) has been publicly saying it doesn\u2019t allow kids on the platform, and diligently worked to detect and expel them, for a decade.\nMeta has internally tracked and documented under-13s, or U13s, in its audience breakdowns for years, as charts in the filing show. In 2018, for instance, it noted that 20% of 12-year-olds on Instagram used it daily. And this was not in a presentation about how to remove them \u2014 it is relating to market penetration. The other chart shows Meta\u2019s \u201cknowledge that 20-60% of 11- to 13-year-old users in particular birth cohorts had actively used Instagram on at least a monthly basis.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to square this with the public position that users this age are not welcome. And it isn\u2019t because leadership wasn\u2019t aware.\nThat same year, 2018, CEO Mark Zuckerberg received a report that there were approximately 4 million people under 13 on Instagram in 2015, which amounted to about a third of all 10-12-year-olds in the U.S., they estimated. Those numbers are obviously dated, but even so they are surprising. Meta has never, to our knowledge, admitted to having such enormous numbers and proportions of under-13 users on its platforms.\nNot externally, at least. Internally, the numbers appear to be well documented. For instance, as the lawsuit alleges:\nMeta possesses data from 2020 indicating that, out of 3,989 children surveyed, 31% of child respondents aged 6-9 and 44% of child respondents aged 10 to 12-years-old had used Facebook.\nIt\u2019s difficult to extrapolate from the 2015 and 2020 numbers to today\u2019s (which, as we have seen from the evidence presented here, will almost certainly not be the whole story), but Bonta noted that the large figures are presented for impact, not as legal justification.\n\u201cThe basic premise remains that their social media platforms are used by millions of children under 13. Whether it\u2019s 30 percent, or 20 or 10 percent\u2026 any child, it\u2019s illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they were doing it at any time, it violated the law at that time. And we are not confident that they have changed their ways.\u201d\nAn internal presentation called \u201c2017 Teens Strategic Focus\u201d appears to specifically target kids under 13, noting that children use tablets as early as 3 or 4, and \u201cSocial identity is an Unmet need Ages 5-11.\u201d One stated goal, according to the lawsuit, was specifically to \u201cgrow [Monthly Active People], [Daily Active People] and time spent among U13 kids.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to note here that while Meta does not permit accounts to be run by people under 13, there are plenty of ways it can lawfully and safely engage with that demographic. Some kids just want to watch videos from SpongeBob Official, and that\u2019s fine. However, Meta must verify parental consent and the ways it can collect and use their data is limited.\nBut the redactions suggest these under-13 users are not of the lawfully and safely engaged type. Reports of underage accounts are reported to be automatically ignored, and Meta \u201ccontinues collecting the child\u2019s personal information if there are no photos associated with the account.\u201d Of 402,000 reports of accounts owned by users under 13 in 2021, fewer than 164,000 were disabled. And these actions reportedly don\u2019t cross between platforms, meaning an Instagram account being disabled doesn\u2019t flag associated or linked Facebook or other accounts.\nZuckerberg testified to Congress in March of 2021 that \u201cif we detect someone might be under the age of 13, even if they lied, we kick them off.\u201d (And \u201cthey lie about it a TON,\u201d one research director said in another quote.) But documents from the next month cited by the lawsuit indicate that \u201cAge verification (for under 13) has a big backlog and demand is outpacing supply\u201d due to a \u201clack of [staffing] capacity.\u201d How big a backlog? At times, the lawsuit alleges, on the order of millions of accounts.\nA potential smoking gun is found in a series of anecdotes from Meta researchers delicately avoiding the possibility of inadvertently confirming an under-13 cohort in their work.\nOne wrote in 2018: \u201cWe just want to make sure to be sensitive about a couple of Instagram-specific items. For example, will the survey go to under 13 year olds? Since everyone needs to be at least 13 years old before they create an account, we want to be careful about sharing findings that come back and point to under 13 year olds being bullied on the platform.\u201d\nIn 2021, another, studying \u201cchild-adult sexual-related content\/behavior\/interactions\u201d (!) said she was \u201cnot includ[ing] younger kids (10-12 yos) in this research\u201d even though there \u201care definitely kids this age on IG,\u201d because she was \u201cconcerned about risks of disclosure since they aren\u2019t supposed to be on IG at all.\u201d\nAlso in 2021, Meta instructed a third-party research company conducting a survey of preteens to remove any information indicating a survey subject was on Instagram, so the \u201ccompany won\u2019t be made aware of under 13.\u201d\nLater that year, external researchers provided Meta with information that \u201cof children ages 9-12, 45% used Facebook and 40% used Instagram daily.\u201d\nDuring an internal 2021 study on youth in social media described in the suit, they first asked parents if their kids are on Meta platforms and removed them from the study if so. But one researcher asked, \u201cWhat happens to kids who slip through the screener and then say they are on IG during the interviews?\u201d Instagram Head of Public Policy Karina Newton responded, \u201cwe\u2019re not collecting user names right?\u201d In other words, what happens is nothing.\nAs the lawsuit puts it:\nEven when Meta learns of specific children on Instagram through interviews with the children, Meta takes the position that it still lacks actual knowledge of that it is collecting personal information from an under-13 user because it does not collect user names while conducting these interviews. In this way, Meta goes through great lengths to avoid meaningfully complying with COPPA, looking for loopholes to excuse its knowledge of users under the age of 13 and maintain their presence on the Platform.\nThe other complaints in the lengthy lawsuit have softer edges, such as the argument that use of the platforms contributes to poor body image and that Meta has failed to take appropriate measures. That\u2019s arguably not as actionable. But the COPPA stuff is far more cut and dry.\n\u201cWe have evidence that parents are sending notes to them about their kids being on their platform, and they\u2019re not getting any action. I mean, what more should you need? It shouldn\u2019t even have to get to that point,\u201d Bonta said.\n\u201cThese social media platforms can do anything they want,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey can be operated by a different algorithm, they can have plastic surgery filters or not have them, they can give you alerts in the middle of the night or during school, or not. They choose to do things that maximize the frequency of use of that platform by children, and the duration of that use. They could end all this today if they wanted, they could easily keep those under 13 from accessing their platform. But they\u2019re not.\u201d\nYou can read the mostly unredacted complaint here.\n(This story has been updated with a comment from Meta.)\n\nThis article, authored by Devin Coldewey, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-27 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":304}
{"title":"Today the FTX jury suffered through a code review","context":"## Today the FTX jury suffered through a code review\n\nAs a result of today\u2019s testimony, I am both more and less confused. I am clearer on what probably happened at FTX. What I don\u2019t understand is why Gary Wang did it.\nWang was the co-founder and chief technology officer of FTX, as well as the co-founder of Alameda Research. He owned only 10 percent of Alameda and 17 percent of FTX. He got a $200,000 a year salary, with no performance bonuses. (Okay, sure, at times he was a billionaire on paper.) By contrast, Bankman-Fried owned 90 percent of Alameda and 65 percent of FTX.\nYet Wang\u2019s testimony suggests he took bizarre risks for his own relatively small share. Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t code, so none of his fingerprints are on the technical changes that let FTX allegedly defraud its customers and investors. Meanwhile, Wang supervised the code behind a key prosecution claim: that Alameda Research was afforded secret, special privileges with FTX\u2019s funds. When FTX went down, Wang left himself with no plausible deniability. I cannot for the life of me understand why.\nNormal customers \u2014 the defense objected to \u201cnormal\u201d but was overruled \u2014 could be automatically liquidated\nToday, the prosecution grilled Wang on a single, damning column in FTX\u2019s databases. Called \u201callow_negative,\u201d it allowed Alameda to have a negative balance. Alameda could withdraw money even when its accounts didn\u2019t have any, and it had an enormous line of credit. Wang added that it could place orders faster than other users, and we already saw evidence that users may have unwittingly deposited money into Alameda rather than FTX.\nThe alleged motivation for this \u2014 as Wang had to explain at painful length to a jury \u2014 was avoiding liquidation. Liquidation is a way for FTX to manage risk when people were engaging in risky bets on its platform. The cartoon version of futures trading is this: a futures exchange is the middleman that lets strangers bet with each other. It lives between the two ends of the bet, paying the winner and collecting from the loser. If the loser doesn\u2019t pay up, the exchange still has to pay the winner, which is why exchanges require collateral.\nUnder some circumstances, exchanges will automatically sell collateral to limit their losses. On FTX, this process was automated, Wang testified. It took about 30 seconds to find accounts that needed to be liquidated to minimize FTX\u2019s losses.\nNormal customers \u2014 the defense objected to \u201cnormal\u201d but was overruled \u2014 could be automatically liquidated, but not Alameda. Bankman-Fried \u201ctold me a few times to make sure that Alameda\u2019s account is never liquidated on FTX,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThe code addition was the result of those conversations.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not Bankman-Fried\u2019s name attached to the change. We saw a code commit from July 31st, 2019 from Nishad Singh titled \u201cOTC trades and transfers to special accounts.\u201d It was written in Python; the upshot was that it added two columns to the account database; the relevant one for our purposes was \u201callow_negative.\u201d This was a toggle that, when it was on, let the account go negative. The feature was turned on the same day in a second set of code that also had Singh\u2019s username on it. Wang said he supervised.\nThat same day, Bankman-Fried tweeted, \u201cAlameda is a liquidity provider on FTX, but their account is just like everyone else\u2019s.\u201d The tweet was, of course, shown in court. Never tweet.\nIt was a tough day for the jury\nAt first, Bankman-Fried said the change was to pay for expenses for the FTT token, which was issued by FTX, Wang said. (Wang described the FTT token as being \u201csort of equity\u201d in FTX, which I think some crypto lawyers would dispute but would probably make the SEC happy.) But once it was implemented, the ability to go negative was used for other things including trading and unlimited withdrawals of FTX\u2019s trading fees and customer money.\nI am summarizing briefly because Wang had to explain to the jury the difference between a front end and back end, explain futures trading, and read a bunch of stuff into the record, which took a while. It was a tough day for the jury \u2014 and probably for Wang, who spoke quickly, perhaps from nerves.\nThe prosecution doesn\u2019t just allege that Alameda had special, secret privileges \u2014 it claims they were used to obfuscate basic elements of FTX\u2019s operations that exposed its supposed selling points as a lie.\nFor instance, FTX advertised that it had a good liquidation system. In many crypto networks, if someone lost enough money, the exchanges could stick other traders with the losses too. FTX touted its automated liquidation as a way to avoid this, so that one customer going bankrupt wouldn\u2019t affect the others.\nFTX lied about how much money was in the backstop fund\nIn the process of liquidating, FTX would try to sell the collateral on the open market, but if it couldn\u2019t finish, then backstop liquidity providers would step in. These were market makers, including Alameda, which could be compensated for the losses they take from a \u201cbackstop fund,\u201d Wang said.\nBut FTX lied about how much money was in the backstop fund, Wang said. In court we saw the code that generated the fake number published on the website: it took the daily trading volume on FTX, multiplied it by a random number, divided it by a billion, and added it to the existing number displayed on the site. It had nothing to do with the actual amount of money in the insurance fund.\nAnd when there wasn\u2019t enough money in the fund, money was moved there from Alameda\u2019s accounts in order to pay the insurance out, Wang said.\nIn late 2019, Alameda had a negative balance on FTX. Because they sat in an open-plan office, Wang heard a trader ask Bankman-Fried if it was okay to keep withdrawing money from that account. Bankman-Fried said it was okay as long as it was lower than FTX\u2019s total trading revenue. He was the CEO of both companies at the time.\nAlameda also allegedly kept FTX from looking bad by assuming some of its losses.\nThe amount that Alameda was allowed to go negative began to creep up. Around 2019 or 2020, Wang checked the database and discovered that Alameda was negative by about $200 million, which was more than the $150 million FTX made in revenue. That had to mean Alameda was taking customer money. It surprised him and he says he discussed it with Bankman-Fried, who told him that he just needed to take into account the value of FTT. Wang said he trusted Bankman-Fried\u2019s judgment and didn\u2019t pursue the issue further. Later, though, Alameda\u2019s balance was more negative than FTT and the trading revenue, and Wang had more conversations with Bankman-Fried about it. Wang said he knew at the time that Alameda was using FTX\u2019s customers\u2019 funds and that he knew it was wrong.\nWe heard yesterday about the line of credit Alameda had on FTX, a staggering $65 billion. Today we saw it in the database. The line of credit didn\u2019t start that big \u2014 Wang testified that Bankman-Fried had asked him to increase it a few times because Alameda kept running into its limits. First it was \u201ca few hundred million,\u201d then a billion, then even that wasn\u2019t enough. It wasn\u2019t clear how Wang arrived at $65 billion specifically, but he said he\u2019d discussed the number with Bankman-Fried. Other customers didn\u2019t have the same privileges.\nAlameda also allegedly kept FTX from looking bad by assuming some of its losses. In 2021, FTX was facing a \u201cseveral hundred million dollar\u201d loss from an exploit in MobileCoin, Wang said. (This seems to have happened in April 2021, though Wang didn\u2019t give a month.) Bankman-Fried directed him to have Alameda take it on instead, because FTX\u2019s balance sheets were visible to investors and Alameda\u2019s weren\u2019t.\nYesterday, Paradigm Capital\u2019s Matt Huang showed us the balance sheets he received from Bankman-Fried. They didn\u2019t include the loss, which should have been included in the second quarter numbers he\u2019d received \u2014 they showed $63 million in trading expenses and $63 million in \u201cother expenses\u201d in that quarter, and an estimated profit of $732 million.\n\u201cFTX was not fine and assets were not fine.\u201d\nBy 2022, Alameda\u2019s negative balance on FTX was a cause for concern for Caroline Ellison, Singh, and Wang. They created a spreadsheet to try to figure out how negative Alameda was. The spreadsheet we saw had several pages of attempts to reconcile. Wang figured that Alameda owed FTX about $11 billion. FTX\u2019s revenue at the time was about $1.5 billion.\nEllison, Singh, Wang, and Bankman-Fried met in the Bahamas office. Alameda\u2019s lenders wanted their money back, and Bankman-Fried directed the group to pay back the lenders using FTX customer funds. Bankman-Fried considered shutting down Alameda, and even wrote a long memo about it. But Wang says that in a now-deleted Signal discussion about the memo, he told Bankman-Fried and Singh that they could not shut down Alameda because they couldn\u2019t repay its debt.\nAnother empty Signal chat, along with its setting to delete messages after a week, was shown to the court. Its members were Ellison, Singh, Wang, and Bankman-Fried.\nThings happened quickly for Wang in November. Wang and Bankman-Fried determined that about $8 billion in customer money was gone, but on November 7th, Bankman-Fried tweeted \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine.\u201d Another tweet in the thread said, \u201cFTX has enough to cover all client holdings.\u201d\n\u201cFTX was not fine and assets were not fine because FTX did not have enough assets for customer withdrawals,\u201d Wang said.\nWhile Bankman-Fried can try to blame Ellison for some of the decisions, the code shows she couldn\u2019t have made all the calls\nFTX went bankrupt on November 11th. On November 12th, Bankman-Fried directed Wang to send customer funds to Bahamanian regulators, Wang said. At the time, customers couldn\u2019t take their funds off the exchange because FTX had run out of money and its servers had been shut down. Bankman-Fried and his father met with lawyers while Wang waited outside with liquidators. The US lawyers wanted the remaining FTX assets transferred to the US, Wang said.\nThat is not what he did. Bankman-Fried told Wang to stall the US lawyers and transfer the funds to Bahamanian regulators, who were more likely to let him stay in control of the company, Wang testified.\nOn November 16th, Wang returned to the US and on November 17th, he met with the US government. Wang hadn\u2019t been arrested or charged; he offered to cooperate immediately. He pled guilty to various charges a month later. Wang was clear: he was cooperating because he didn\u2019t want to go to jail. He was hoping that his assistance means that a sentencing judge will be lenient, he said.\nThis was the first full account of Alameda\u2019s and FTX\u2019s entanglements I heard in the trial, and it came from a co-owner of both companies. It was striking, though, that while there was evidence of the computer code that gave Alameda special privileges, there was no evidence of the conversations Wang recounted. Of course Wang turned himself in quickly; sooner or later, someone would find his code \u2014 and Singh\u2019s, too.\nIt also struck me that all of Bankman-Fried\u2019s vanishing messages might not help him as much as he\u2019d hoped. He said too many things in public to too many people. Even without the smoking gun of Signal messages, it\u2019s hard to see how he wasn\u2019t involved. Wang was a dev; the money wasn\u2019t his area. And while Bankman-Fried can try to blame Ellison for some of the decisions, the code shows she couldn\u2019t have made all the calls. After all, she wasn\u2019t FTX\u2019s CEO. And in 2019, she wasn\u2019t Alameda\u2019s CEO, either.\n\nThis article, authored by Elizabeth Lopatto, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-06 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":305}
{"title":"A deficit budget for 2024","context":"## A deficit budget for 2024\n\n\u201cAfter extensive deliberations and negotiations, the House of Representatives on Wednesday (Sept. 27) approved on third and final reading the P5.768-trillion national budget for next year, just before Congress adjourns for a month-long break,\u201d the Press and Public Affairs Bureau of Congress announced on its website, congress.gov.ph. The 310-strong legislative chamber voted 296 against three, with zero abstentions, to approve House Bill (HB) No. 8980 or the 2024 national budget on third and final reading. Almost unanimously.\nHouse Speaker Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez noted that the budgeting process was marked by rigorous discussions, particularly concerning confidential and intelligence funds, which the House meticulously scrutinized to ensure accountability and responsible utilization. He lauded \u201cthe timely passage of the 2024 General Appropriations Bill (GAB),\u201d stating that it not only \u201cdemonstrated the commitment of the House to upholding its constitutional role but also underscored its dedication to serving the Filipino people with transparency and accountability.\u201d\nThe Department of Budget and Management (DBM) defines the government budget as \u201cthe financial plan of the government\u2026which shows what its resources are, and how they will be generated and used over the fiscal period. It refers to the income, expenditures and sources of borrowings of the National Government (NG) that are used to achieve national objectives, strategies and programs.\u201d\nSection 22, Article VII of the Constitution states that: \u201cThe President shall submit to the Congress within 30 days from the opening of every regular session, as the basis of the general appropriation bill, a budget of expenditures and sources of financing including receipts from existing and proposed revenue measures.\u201d\nThe National Government (NG) budget is the totality of the budgets of all government entities, namely the National Government, the non-financial government-owned and -controlled corporations (which usually includes only the 14 major GOCCs), government financial institutions (GFIs), local government units (LGUs), the social security institutions (the Government Service Insurance System or GSIS, the Social Security System or SSS, the military pensions, PhilHealth, etc.), the Oil Price Stabilization Fund, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and the Central Bank-Board of Liquidators. It is allocated for the implementation of various government programs and projects, the operation of government offices, payment of salaries of government employees, and payment of public debts. These expenditures are classified by expense class, sector and implementing unit of government (dbm.gov.ph).\nThe sources of appropriations of the annual budget are: 1.) new general appropriations legislated by Congress for every budget year under the General Appropriations Act (GAA); and 2.) existing appropriations previously authorized by Congress. Under the Constitution, Article VI, Section 29, no money can be withdrawn from the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.\nThe DBM calls a budget balanced when revenues match expenditures or disbursements. When expenditures exceed revenues, the government incurs a deficit which may result in the following situations: a.) the government borrows money either from foreign sources or from the domestic capital market which increases the debt stock of the NG and its debt servicing requirements; b.) the government borrows money from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; or, c.) the government withdraws funds from its cash balances in the Treasury. Historically, National Government expenditures have always exceeded total revenues resulting in annual budget deficits, the DBM declared. \u201cThus, the National Government had to resort to borrowing to cover said deficits which resulted in the ballooning of foreign and domestic debts,\u201d the budget office admitted.\n\u201cHowever, in 1994, the government broke the deficit trend by posting a budget surplus of P16 billion through an aggressive privatization and revenue generation program and a prudent expenditure program. Since then, the government has been exerting efforts to maintain the surplus budget policy. The surplus budget policy is important to encourage economic growth,\u201d the DBM said.\nThe exhortations of the national budget managers must be quoted word for word to educate the non-economists and questioning common people about how a surplus budget is necessary versus a deficit budget:\n\u201cThe less the government borrow from the public, the lesser the pressure on interest and inflation rates and the more funds are made available in the financial market. Such funds may be used by businessmen to build factories, hire workers, buy equipment and open more employment opportunities. By keeping more funds in the hands of the private sector rather than competing for credit, the government helps make financing available for families who want to own homes, buy cars, or support their children\u2019s education. The government also needs to generate a budget surplus to repay the huge debt it has accumulated over the years. The reduction of the national budget debt will correspondingly lessen government\u2019s requirements for interest and principal payments. This becomes important particularly during periods of rising interest rates and unstable exchange rates\u201d (dbm.gov.ph).\nWhy then, do we have a deficit budget for 2024?\nThe national budget for 2024 is at P5.768 trillion, 9.5% higher than the current (2023) budget of P5.268 trillion. Observers note that this first budget fully prepared by the current administration accounts for 21.7% of gross domestic product (GDP). The 2024 expenditure program is higher by P499.6 billion or a year-on-year growth rate of 9.5% as compared to the 2023 level of P5.268 trillion. The P5.768-trillion budget, to be supported mainly by P3.5-trillion tax revenues (based on 2023 tax revenue projections), would mean a budget deficit of some P2.268 trillion, to be funded by additional borrowings. This could increase government debt from the current P14.24 trillion (as of July) to P16+ trillion by the end of 2024.\nDuring the Congressional budget hearing, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno optimistically provided updates on the government\u2019s fiscal and revenue collection performances and presented sources of funding for the national budget. Tax revenue is projected to increase from P3.5 trillion in 2023 to P6.5 trillion in 2028, while non-tax revenues are expected to decline from P191 billion in 2023 to P184 billion in 2028, Diokno told the Philippine News Agency (pna.gov.ph, Aug. 10).\nDiokno said the Finance department aims to gradually reduce net financing or new debt from P1.42 trillion in 2022 to P1.22 trillion in 2024, which will help bring the country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio to almost below 60% by 2025. And yet, \u201cWe worry about our debt-to-GDP ratio in the Philippines, as it stands at about 63% and that\u2019s a little high for us and it is not ideal,\u201d President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. told members of the US-ASEAN Business Council who visited Malaca\u00f1ang (ABS-CBN, Aug. 9, 2023).\nWhom are we to believe, but inflation \u2014 which independently says it as it is.\n\u201cWhile inflation in the Philippines has been on a downward trend since January, the country needs to achieve a 3.7% average inflation rate for the next five months for the country to hit the BSP\u2019s forecast of 5.5% inflation for 2023, Assistant National Statistician Rachel Lacsa said (Ibid.). Some economists say that deficit budgets and the remedies \u2014 monetary (borrowings increasing money supply) and fiscal (like raising taxes) increase inflation, and stubborn inflation further entrenches structural deficits in the system. It is a vicious cycle.\u201d\nNational budgets might not be innocent of political agendas (call them plans and programs) that can divert money from the proper socio-economic goals of equilibrium as a balanced budget might work towards. But traditional politicians (called \u201ctrapo\u201d in the Philippines) might have it in their hearts to think about the country and the welfare of future generations.\nHow many generations will pay for the monstrous debt incurred for the dubious objectives and vanities of some today?\nAmelia H.

If you\u2019re looking to experience some of the winners from the 2023 Game Awards for yourself, you can find discounts on a variety of titles on Steam. Some other highlights you might want to check out include a sitewide sale on Blu-Rays from The Criterion Collection, and the Xbox Series X matching its Black Friday price on Walmart and Amazon.\nAs we do every weekend here at Polygon, we\u2019ve rounded up a collection of our favorite deals from the worlds of gaming and entertainment, along with some of the best-selling products that have made a recent appearance on our site.\nThe best gaming deals this week\nSteam is discounting many contenders from the 2023 Game Awards and winners from the past nine years. This is a fantastic opportunity to supplement your library with some of the biggest releases of 2023, like Diablo 4 and Starfield, but you can also find discounts on essential titles that you may have missed, like Valiant Hearts, Her Story, or Celeste. Below, we\u2019ve highlighted some of the winners from the 2023 Game Awards, but we also featured a larger list of winners from previous years.\nCocoon is the latest title from a studio founded by Jeppe Carlsen, the person responsible for the unsettling narrative platformers Limbo and Inside.

{"title":"Fasting could reduce signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, studies suggest: \u2018Profound effects\u2019","context":"## Fasting could reduce signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, studies suggest: \u2018Profound effects\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s been proven that what people eat can help prevent or slow Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 but what about when they eat?\nParticipating in intermittent (time-restricted) fasting could lead to a reduced risk of cognitive deterioration, a recent study published in the journal Cell Metabolism suggests.\nResearchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine adjusted the feeding schedule of certain groups of mice so that they only ate within six-hour windows each day.\nALZHEIMER\u2019S BLOOD TEST COULD HIT THE MARKET IN EARLY 2024, RESEARCHERS SAY\n(This would be equivalent to 14 hours of fasting for humans, the researchers noted.)\nCompared to a control group of mice that ate on demand, the fasting mice showed improvements in memory, were less hyperactive in the evenings and had fewer sleep disruptions .\nThey also were shown to have less buildup of amyloid proteins in the brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe goal of the restricted eating is to restore the circadian rhythm, the researchers said, which could help counteract the numerous disruptions that Alzheimer\u2019s patients face when it comes to sleep and schedule-related confusion.\nHIDDEN BELLY FAT COULD SIGNAL ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE RISK 15 YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS SHOW UP, STUDY FINDS\n\"Our study emphasizes the power of feeding timing in aligning the circadian clock and its impact on the brain,\" said senior study author Paula Desplats, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine, in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"We were hopeful to see some improvements in pathology, but did not expect such profound effects in reducing plaques and inflammation and improving memory,\" she went on.\n\"The effects of time-restricted feeding on lower amyloid pathology were also measurable in blood using markers found in the clinic, which was another important finding.\"\nThe researchers hope that these findings will lead to human trials.\nThe goal is to obtain funding to start a pilot study of patients next year.\n\"Accessible interventions like this have great translational potential, as they are available and are usually very well-tolerated,\" Desplats said.\nThe goal is to obtain funding to start a pilot study of patients next year.\n\"This may have special importance for the elderly , as time-restricted eating does not require limitation in calories or change in the diet, but may offer important benefits ranging from metabolic and sleep regulation to potential cognitive improvement.\"\nTIME-RESTRICTED EATING NO MORE BENEFICIAL THAN CALORIC RESTRICTION IN OBESE PATIENTS, STUDY SAYS\nAdopting a new dietary pattern should not be a replacement for medical care , however, as Desplats emphasized the importance of patients' discussions about options with their clinicians.\nOne major limitation of the study is that it uses animal models that only represent certain aspects of disease and \"do not present comorbidities or other clinical diseases associated with aging, which are very common in Alzheimer\u2019s patients,\" noted Desplats.\n\"Furthermore, the study was done under strictly controlled conditions that did not resemble the variety of people\u2019s habits and environments,\" she added.\nTHE 8 BIGGEST ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE MYTHS \u2014 AND THE TRUTHS BEHIND THEM\nThe researchers hope that the public recognizes the importance of the circadian clock in regulating many aspects of health .\n\"Sustaining healthy sleep and eating habits that are more synchronized with the natural environment are vital in a society that is constantly exposed to food, light and shift work,\" said Desplats.\nPrevious studies have supported this association between fasting and reduced Alzheimer\u2019s risk.\nLast year, a study led by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology in Los Angeles also found that mice that followed a fasting diet showed lower levels of \"plaques and tangles\" in the brain, reduced brain inflammation and better performance on cognitive tests.\n\"Cycles of a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) had strong effects against Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms in two different types of Alzheimer\u2019s mouse models,\" the lead author of that study, USC biogerontologist Dr. Valter Longo, told Fox News Digital.\n\"Fasting decreases pro-aging factors that are secreted after we eat, which can slow down the aging of the brain.\"\n\"In mice, the effects of FMD cycles were very strong and wide, meaning they affected both learning and memory and also Alzheimer\u2019s pathology peptides\/proteins (amyloid and tau).\"\nBased on these findings, Longo recommends that people talk to their neurologist about considering fasting-mimicking diets and other nutrition-based approaches in support of standard-of-care drugs and therapies.\n\"Especially for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, for which pharmacological interventions have had very limited efficacy, it will be very important to continue to study fasting-mimicking diets and other dietary interventions that can make drugs more effective,\" he added.\nDesplats, lead author of the UC San Diego study, told Fox News Digital that Longo\u2019s studies are on a similar track, demonstrating the connection between metabolism, fasting and brain health.\n\"The main difference is that we tested an approach that does not require calorie reduction, which may be more sustainable and safer for older people whose metabolisms are already impacted by aging changes,\" she said.\nCOLORADO WOMAN WITH ALZHEIMER\u2019S IS STILL VIBRANT AFTER MORE THAN 4 YEARS: \u2018I REFUSE TO SURRENDER\u2019\nDr. Joseph Antoun, CEO and chairman of the nutritech company L-Nutra in California, was also involved in the USC study.\n\"In these studies, mice fed the fasting-mimicking diet showed improved cognitive performance, motor learning and both short- and long-term memory, and promoted the growth of new neurons in the brain,\" he told Fox News Digital via email.\n\"Fasting-mimicking diets have the potential to drastically reduce many aging and disease risk factors by reducing neuroinflammation or superoxide production in the brain.\"\nFasting can help the brain function in a myriad of ways, said Antoun.\n\"Fasting decreases pro-aging factors that are secreted after we eat, which can slow down the aging of the brain,\" he told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement.\nTime-restricted eating can also improve the quality of sleep, he noted, which can help the brain recover better.\nBecause fasting-mimicking diets can be done in longer periods, they can help the body go into higher levels of ketosis, Antoun noted, \"which is wonderful for the brain.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n(Ketosis, which is when the body burns fat for energy instead of glucose, has been shown to have cognitive benefits.)\n\"Prolonged fasting can also help with leaky gut, which then can aid the brain,\" added Antoun.\nIn addition, intermittent fasting can help to control blood sugar , which can slow down the progression of Alzheimer's, the doctor said.\nOver the past several decades, there has been a steady increase in diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, Antoun noted.\n\"However, when we are able to detect neurodegenerative conditions early, we can take positive steps that may slow the process and mitigate any major side effects of the disorder,\" he said.\nDuring prolonged periods of fasting, cells undergo a process called autophagy, which involves removing and recycling damaged cellular components, Antoun said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"This process is essential for maintaining proper cellular function and can help protect the brain from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s,\" he explained.\nMore than six million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer's, and every 67 seconds, someone in America develops the disease, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-12-06 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":309}

Everyone has their own \u201chacks\u201d when it comes to falling asleep in 2023; the days of counting sheep are long gone. Jennifer Aniston\u2019s top tip for battling insomnia is to \u201csleep with my phone at least five feet away from me\u201d, while Martha Stewart recommends focusing on your breathing. In her 1973 feminist novel Fear of Flying, author Erica Jong notes that, sometimes, the only way to overcome sleeplessness is by pretending you don\u2019t care about nodding off. \u201cThen sleep became piqued, like a rejected lover, and crept up to try to seduce you.\u201d\nIn a world where human sleep patterns have increasingly been plunged into chaos, people are having to turn to ever more creative \u2013 and often bizarre \u2013 means of getting their 40 winks in. Today, the internet is littered with tips and tricks that promise a sound sleep, but not all of them are effective and none are foolproof. (Kiwis, by the way, contain serotonin and antioxidants, which is why it\u2019s thought they might have sleep-promoting benefits.) The result is a society with a growing problem on its hands: persistent sleeplessness \u2013 otherwise known as insomnia.\nGlobally, it is estimated that around 10 per cent of adults meet the criteria for insomnia; the sleep disorder is characterised either by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep to such an extent that it disturbs your ability to function during the day.\nInsomnia lies at the heart of the new Apple TV+ comedy series Still Up. The show follows Lisa (Antonia Thomas) and Danny (Craig Roberts), two best friends who stay up late talking to each other because they can\u2019t sleep. Lit by the blue glow emanating from their electronic devices, Lisa and Danny form a deep connection over their nocturnal calls, with their friendship gradually drifting into something more. At one point, Lisa checks herself into a sleep clinic in London, telling Danny she\u2019s willing to \u201ctry anything\u201d at this point \u2013 a sentiment the sleepless know all too well.\nThe series was inspired by creator Natalie Walter\u2019s own experience with insomnia, and her late-night Facebook chats with Steve Burge, her co-writer on Still Up. \u201cAs part of the research for [the show] we visited a sleep clinic, which was fascinating,\u201d she tells me. \u201cSome evolutionary biologists think the reason humans have different sleep patterns is that during our early history, a few members of the tribe would always be awake and vigilant during the night, and so could protect everyone else from predators. Not that I\u2019d be much use fighting off a woolly mammoth.\u201d\nJust like depression or anxiety, insomnia can often be triggered by something. Whether it\u2019s a life event as monumental as becoming a new parent, or something as commonplace as jet lag, there are any number of things that can prompt a bout of sleeplessness. The issue, explains sleep therapist Dr Lindsay Browning, is that insomnia can often remain long after the trigger has gone. \u201cAt this point, you\u2019re no longer worried about the traumatic incident; you\u2019re now worried about not being able to sleep.\u201d It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nSocial media consultant and mother of two, Amy Fieldhouse-Downes, started suffering from insomnia after the birth of her second son in 2019. She believes the affliction was rooted in anxiety. \u201cIf you Google how to go to sleep, I\u2019ve probably tried everything on there,\u201d she says. \u201cGoing to bed earlier, going to bed later, meditations that would get cut off by an advert, lavender products, sleep cream, eye masks, Sominex sleep tablets. And I even used it as an excuse to have a few glasses of wine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until she tried sleeping with specialised earplugs that she was finally able to get some rest.\nLong-time insomniac and video producer Preshita says she has tried many tricks over the years \u2013 \u201cfrom drinking chamomile tea to counting backwards from 1,000\u201d. After much experimenting, she has found that taking a shower before bed and keeping her bedroom clutter-free were the most effective methods. \u201cSomeone recommended masturbating, and that was another thing that worked,\u201d she adds.\n\u2018Still Up\u2019 follows Lisa (Antonia Thomas) and Danny (Craig Roberts) as best friends who stay up late talking to each other because they can\u2019t sleep (Courtesy of Apple)\nMillions of people struggle with insomnia in the UK alone. Studies have found that women are 40 per cent more likely to be affected by insomnia than men. \u201cThis sex difference in insomnia emerges after puberty, suggesting that hormonal differences such as menstruation, pregnancy and menopause may be the cause of this increased risk in women,\u201d Dr Browning says. The symptoms of insomnia can last a long time; a longitudinal study conducted in the UK found that 69 per cent of respondents affected by the sleep disorder at the start of the study still had insomnia 12 months later.\nThis may go to show how complex treating insomnia can be. Explaining the appeal of quick fixes, Dr Browning says, \u201cIn the short term you\u2019re changing something, so [they] can often [work] like a placebo. If hunger is keeping you awake, eating before bed will help. If your mattress is uncomfortable, sleeping on the floor will help.\u201d But the problem isn\u2019t just that these methods don\u2019t necessarily work \u2013 it\u2019s that they could be used to exploit vulnerable insomniacs.\n\u201cI\u2019m a sleep therapist, my doctorate is in insomnia and it\u2019s very, very frustrating,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople who have insomnia are desperate. I treat patients who are suicidal, who have quit their jobs, whose lives are completely on hold because of their sleeping issues. And they\u2019re vulnerable. My clients have spent hundreds and hundreds of pounds on things that made no difference. If people are being mis-sold expensive things and they\u2019re being preyed upon, that\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d\nRosie Davies-Smith, a PR consultant, says she has spent more than \u00a3600 on a variety of treatments, including a combination of doctor-prescribed and over-the-counter medications, teas, supplements, weighted blankets, and eye masks. \u201cWhile supplements, exercise, and sleep hygiene provided some relief, the true breakthrough came from addressing the root causes of my insomnia through therapy,\u201d she tells me.\nRosie Davies-Smith, a PR consultant, says she has spent more than \u00a3600 on a variety of treatments, including a combination of doctor-prescribed and over-the-counter medications (Getty Images)\nAs with many other mental health disorders, therapy can often provide long-term relief from insomnia. The most effective of these therapies is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI),\u201d says Dr Browning, describing it as a \u201ccomplete cure\u201d that a lot of people don\u2019t know about. \u201cDifferent from CBT for depression or CBT for anxiety, CBTI works by addressing the negative thoughts and worries that perpetuate insomnia.\u201d\nOther avenues of treatment are also proving increasingly fruitful. A new drug called Quviviq was just approved by the NHS last week. Dr Browning is optimistic about the \u201cexciting\u201d new medication, explaining that it acts in a very different way to other sleeping pills, which \u201cknock you out\u201d but cause people to develop a tolerance. \u201cAs much as CBTI is the gold standard across the world, there might be some people who need a bit of [medicinal] help as well, a bit like depression.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Dr Browning says there\u2019s no harm in trying the occasional Reddit recommendation \u2013 if it\u2019s free. That might be an act of self-pleasure, narrating the plot of Pride and Prejudice in your head, or listening to shipping forecasts. FaceTiming your best friend into the early hours of the morning \u2013 like Lisa and Danny do in Still Up \u2013 probably isn\u2019t encouraged, but it does make for a very good romcom.\n\u2018Still Up\u2019 is available for streaming on Apple TV+.\n\nThis article, authored by Maanya Sachdeva, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-01 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":310}
{"title":"FanDuel 'Prop Stars' Picks: Best bets for Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift-inspired props for Chiefs-Jets Week 4","context":"## FanDuel 'Prop Stars' Picks: Best bets for Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift-inspired props for Chiefs-Jets Week 4\n\nTravis Kelce has been catching a lot more than footballs lately, and fans everywhere have been swift to hop on the Taylor Swift bandwagon. The celebrity couple has been in the news for well over a week now, and despite the fatigue from many -- Chris 'Mad Dog' Russo's rant being among the most vocal -- companies like FanDuel just can't help but lean into a profitable storyline. Are they for real or is this \"Love Story\" just some extravagant publicity stunt?\nTime will tell, but one thing's for certain when it comes to the media, social media, newspapers, football fans, Swifties, and just about everyone else within the 50 states and U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam: \"You need to calm down.\" Regardless, Kelce and Swift take their tour on the road to Broadway, a place that puts on all the great shows. The traditional circus hasn't been in town for a few years now, but that's simply because the New York Jets exist and there was only room for one. It seems like ages since Aaron Rodgers marched out of the MetLife Stadium tunnel holding an American flag, but this is Zach Wilson's team now, whether you like it or not.\nOne of the most hyped \"Sunday Night Football\" games of the year was expected to feature Rodgers against Patrick Mahomes for the first time. Instead, we're more likely to be treated to non-stop split screens involving Swift and Rodgers, two people who won't be on the field. There will be some actual football, though, even if it is just a sideshow to the event everyone can't stop talking about. So, buckle up and enjoy whatever this is, and for all the fans paying ridiculous prices for a glimpse of Ms. Swift \u2014 make sure your phone is charged.\nTo Travis and Taylor, \"Welcome to New York.\" It's been waiting for you. Well, actually, the swamps of northern New Jersey have. Enjoy the traffic and a look at the famous skyline.\nFor bettors, where there is hype, there's also an opportunity to make some money. FanDuel has released a special prop bets menu, cleverly called \"Prop Stars\" for the Swift-inspired wagers. Here's a look at how you can catch some cash in prime time.\nMORE: Jets vs. Chiefs betting preview\nFanDuel 'Prop Stars' Picks: Best bets for Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift-inspired props for Chiefs-Jets Week 4\nTop of the Charts: Travis Kelce to have the Most Receiving Yards in the Game (+140)\nThe Jets know that Kelce is trouble long before he even walks in. If they want any chance in this game, they'll have to slow down No. 87. This is a New York defense that's been very good, although not quite great, over the last year and continues to improve. Robert Saleh's troops have held opponents in check, giving their anemic offense a fighting chance most weeks, but if there's one thing that Gang Green struggles to defend against, it's the tight end. They're giving up the fifth-most receiving yards to the position this season (56.3) and just allowed Pharoah Brown to beat them for a long 58-yard touchdown last Sunday. Getting +140 is a nice price for the best pass-catcher in this game, but there's too much blowout potential to warrant taking a flier here.\nOur pick: Pass\nSeeing Red: Chiefs to Win by 22+ (+380)\nIf this bet ends up cashing, the \"Seeing Red\" tagline would apply to a lot more than just Chiefs fans. Bettors would be in the green, and those wearing green would be the ones with red-ish, cartoon-like faces. Odds are, Wilson would have to be atrocious again considering New York's defense isn't a pushover. The Jets often like to make games close, even when they seemingly have no business in doing so. Even if they are steamrolled, a garbage time score is more than enough to ruin this wager.\nOur pick: Pass\nOpening Act: Travis Kelce First TD Scorer (+400)\nOut of all the specials, this one is our favorite. The Chiefs will likely score first whether they get the opening kickoff or not. When we look at the Jets, we see an offensive coordinator that somehow underrated Micah Parsons and a team that refuses to take the training wheels off their former gunslinging quarterback. Wilson has turned into \"Checkdown Charlie\" as a result of conservative coaching, and we don't expect that to change in the early going. Lean into the narrative and sprinkle a little cash on Kelce to break the plane first.\nOur pick: Bet on it\nFriENDZONE: Travis Kelce to NOT score a TD (+120)\nObviously, based on our last recommendation, we're friendzoning this bet and not laying down any action on it.\nOur pick: Pass\nRunning Away Together: Chiefs to have 150+ Total Rushing Yards (+420)\nThe strength of the Jets roster is along the defensive line, and the Chiefs are a pass-first team that loves to light it up through the air. This is the first time that Patrick Mahomes is playing in the New York area. He'll want to put on a show, and Andy Reid certainly isn't going to hold him back. Don't expect the Chiefs to start running until it's time to chew the clock.\nOur pick: Pass\nSeemingly Ranch: Travis Kelce Last TD Scorer (+550)\nRanch is a fine condiment and beloved by many, which makes this wager something that should be seen as an insult to ranch fans everywhere. Unless the Jets make this a close game or send it to overtime, we have a hard time believing that Kelce will even be on the field to score the last touchdown. Avoid this one like people with taste buds avoid bleu cheese and treat your nuggets with respect.\nOur pick: Pass\nPlot Twist: Zach Wilson to have 300+ Passing Yards (+1800)\nIf you asked the average Jets' fan what is holding this roster back, the overwhelming results would be Wilson. \"I'm the problem, it's me,\" would probably qualify as the lyrics played in his walk-up song if fans had anything to say about it. But Wilson doesn't have time to be the anti-hero, or villain, as traditionalists would say. He needs to flip the script and shake it off. The Jets need to let him sling the ball around the field instead of worrying about the bad turnovers. They aren't winning this game 14-10, and they aren't winning anything if they can't let their quarterback be who he is. Are we betting this? Absolutely not, but that would be one heck of a plot twist, right? Perhaps the script writers are working overtime.\nOur pick: Pass\nPlatinum Performance: Travis Kelce to Score 3+ TDs (+2500)\nWhen it comes to Kelce's greatest hits, he prefers to save them for division rivals like the Raiders and Chargers. In your wildest dreams this bet might hit, and it might happen in reality too. Kelce could be schmoozing in the suite when the second half begins rather than throwing blocks and catching footballs on the field. But if the Jets keep it close, they are prone to being exploited by players like Kelce. With receivers lacking on the Chiefs sideline, the tight end might put on a show that is typically only found in show business. Considering he hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d back in March, Kelce is familiar with how to tell a story. We have him scoring once, so what\u2019s another two times to cash a monster long shot? Don't count on it, but don't rule it out either. And please, have fun and bet responsibly.\nOur pick: Bet on it (with a small wager)\nExes & 0s: NY Jets to Score 0 Total Points (+3400)\nThe Jets are currently back in a familiar place as the laughingstock of the NFL. Swift, like many celebrities, has plenty of exes, but she always scores again. Maybe the haters are right. Maybe Kelce will be the subject of the next big hit. Maybe the publicists are cashing checks with this brilliant idea. Maybe it's real. Time will tell, but when the relationship inevitably falls apart like most dream celebrity couples do, there is always another someone. Point is, the Jets are without the quarterback they married, and now they're back together with Wilson. It's not glamorous, but they'll score again. Shutting out NFL teams is no easy task, but the Chiefs defense is much improved and the Jets look like a team that doesn\u2019t have a quarterback. Don\u2019t consider it likely to hit, but +3400 wagers hardly ever are. Consider this a fun bet, unless you\u2019re a Jets fan, and see how long K.C. can keep NYC off the scoreboard. They might just do it for the entire game.\nOur pick: Bet on it (with a small wager)\n\nThis article, authored by Nick Brinkerhoff, was published by Sporting News on 2023-09-28 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":311}
{"title":"The US Senate and Silicon Valley reconvene for a second AI Insight Forum","context":"## The US Senate and Silicon Valley reconvene for a second AI Insight Forum\n\nSenator Charles Schumer (D-NY) once again played host to Silicon Valley\u2019s AI leaders on Tuesday as the US Senate reconvened its AI Insights Forum for a second time. On the guest list this go around: manifesto enthusiast Marc Andreessen and venture capitalist John Doerr, as well as Max Tegmark of the Future of Life Institute and NAACP CEO Derrick Johnson. On the agenda: \u201cthe transformational innovation that pushes the boundaries of medicine, energy, and science, and the sustainable innovation necessary to drive advancements in security, accountability, and transparency in AI,\u201d according to a release from Sen. Schumer\u2019s office.\nUpon exiting the meeting Tuesday, Schumer told the assembled press, \"it is clear that American leadership on AI can\u2019t be done on the cheap. Almost all of the experts in today\u2019s Forum called for robust, sustained federal investment in private and public sectors to achieve our goals of American-led transformative and sustainable innovation in AI.\nPer National Security AI Commission estimates, paying for that could cost around $32 billion a year. However, Schumer believes that those funding challenges can be addressed by \"leveraging the private sector by employing new and innovative funding mechanisms \u2013 like the Grand Challenges prize idea.\"\n\"We must prioritize transformational innovation, to help create new vistas, unlock new cures, improve education, reinforce national security, protect the global food supply, and more,\" Schumer remarked. But in doing so, we must act sustainably in order to minimize harms to workers, civil society and the environment. \"We need to strike a balance between transformational and sustainable innovation,\" Schumer said. \"Finding this balance will be key to our success.\"\nSenators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and John Kennedy (R-LA) also got in on the proposed regulatory action Tuesday, introducing legislation that would provide more transparency on AI-generated content by requiring clear labeling and disclosures. Such technology could resemble the Content Credentials tag that the C2PA and CAI industry advocacy groups are developing.\n\"Our bill is simple,\" Senator Schatz said in a press statement. \"If any content is made by artificial intelligence, it should be labeled so that people are aware and aren\u2019t fooled or scammed.\u201d\nThe Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act, as they're calling it, would require generative AI system developers to clearly and conspicuously disclose AI-generated content to users. Those developers, and their licensees, would also have to take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent \"systematic publication of content without disclosures.\" The bill would also establish a working group to create non-binding technical standards to help social media platforms automatically identify such content as well.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bIt puts the onus where it belongs: on the companies and not the consumers,\u201d Schatz said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \u201cLabels will help people to be informed. They will also help companies using AI to build trust in their content.\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s meeting follows the recent introduction of new AI legislation, dubbed the Artificial Intelligence Advancement Act of 2023 (S. 3050). Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Todd Young (R-IN) all co-sponsored the bill. The bill proposes AI bug bounty programs and would require a vulnerability analysis study for AI-enabled military applications. It\u2019s passage into law would also launch a report into AI regulation in the financial services industry (which the head of the SEC had recently been lamenting) as well as a second report on data sharing and coordination.\n\u201cIt\u2019s frankly a hard challenge,\u201d SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told The Financial Times recently, speaking on the challenges the financial industry faces in AI adoption and regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard financial stability issue to address because most of our regulation is about individual institutions, individual banks, individual money market funds, individual brokers; it\u2019s just in the nature of what we do.\u201d\n\"Working people are fighting back against artificial intelligence and other technology used to eliminate workers or undermine and exploit us,\" AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said at the conclusion of Tuesday's forum. \"If we fail to involve workers and unions across the entire innovation process, AI will curtail our rights, threaten good jobs and undermine our democracy. But the responsible adoption of AI, properly regulated, has the potential to create opportunity, improve working conditions and build prosperity.\"\nThe forums are part of Senator Schumer\u2019s SAFE Innovation Framework, which his office debuted in June. \u201cThe US must lead in innovation and write the rules of the road on AI and not let adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party craft the standards for a technology set to become as transformative as electricity,\u201d the program announcement reads.\nWhile Andreesen calls for AI advancement at any cost and Tegmark continues to advocate for a developmental \u201ctime out,\u201d rank and file AI industry workers are also fighting to make their voices heard ahead of the forum. On Monday, a group of employees from two dozen leading AI firms published an open letter to Senator Schumer, demanding Congress take action to safeguard their livelihoods from the \u201cdystopian future\u201d that Andreessen\u2019s screed, for example, would require.\n\u201cEstablishing robust protections related to workplace technology and rebalancing power between workers and employers could reorient the economy and tech innovation toward more equitable and sustainable outcomes,\u201d the letter authors argue.\nSenator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) had, the previous month, called on leading AI companies to \u201canswer for the working conditions of their data workers, laborers who are often paid low wages and provided no benefits but keep AI products online.\u201d\n\"We covered a lot of good ground today, and I think we\u2019ll all be walking out of the room with a deeper understanding of how to approach American-led AI innovation,\" Schumer said Tueseay. \"We\u2019ll continue this conversation in weeks and months to come \u2013 in more forums like this and committee hearings in Congress \u2013 as we work to develop comprehensive, bipartisan AI legislation.\"\n\nThis article, authored by Andrew Tarantola, was published by Engadget on 2023-10-25 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":312}
{"title":"Sweeping White House AI executive order takes aim at the technology's toughest challenges","context":"## Sweeping White House AI executive order takes aim at the technology's toughest challenges\n\nThe Biden Administration unveiled its ambitious next steps in addressing and regulating artificial intelligence development on Monday. Its expansive new executive order (EO) seeks to establish further protections for the public as well as improve best practices for federal agencies and their contractors.\n\"The President several months ago directed his team to pull every lever,\" a senior administration official told reporters on a recent press call. \"That's what this order does, bringing the power of the federal government to bear in a wide range of areas to manage AI's risk and harness its benefits ... It stands up for consumers and workers, promotes innovation and competition, advances American leadership around the world and like all executive orders, this one has the force of law.\"\nThese actions will be introduced over the next year with smaller safety and security changes happening in around 90 days and with more involved reporting and data transparency schemes requiring nine to 12 months to fully deploy. The administration is also creating an \u201cAI council,\u201d chaired by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed, who will meet with federal agency heads to ensure that the actions are being executed on schedule.\nASSOCIATED PRESS\nPublic safety\n\"In response to the President's leadership on the subject, 15 major American technology companies have begun their voluntary commitments to ensure that AI technology is safe, secure and trustworthy before releasing it to the public,\" the senior administration official said. \"That is not enough.\"\nThe EO directs the establishment of new standards for AI safety and security, including reporting requirements for developers whose foundation models might impact national or economic security. Those requirements will also apply in developing AI tools to autonomously implement security fixes on critical software infrastructure.\nBy leveraging the Defense Production Act, this EO will \"require that companies developing any foundation model that poses a serious risk to national security, national economic security, or national public health and safety must notify the federal government when training the model, and must share the results of all red-team safety tests,\" per a White House press release. That information must be shared prior to the model being made available to to the public, which could help reduce the rate at which companies unleash half-baked and potentially deadly machine learning products.\nIn addition to the sharing of red team test results, the EO also requires disclosure of the system\u2019s training runs (essentially, its iterative development history). \u201cWhat that does is that creates a space prior to the release\u2026 to verify that the system is safe and secure,\u201d officials said.\nAdministration officials were quick to point out that this reporting requirement will not impact any AI models currently available on the market, nor will it impact independent or small- to medium-size AI companies moving forward, as the threshold for enforcement is quite high. It's geared specifically for the next generation of AI systems that the likes of Google, Meta and OpenAI are already working on with enforcement on models starting at 10^26 petaflops, a capacity currently beyond the limits of existing AI models. \"This is not going to catch AI systems trained by graduate students, or even professors,\u201d the administration official said.\nWhat's more, the EO will encourage the Departments of Energy and Homeland Security to address AI threats \"to critical infrastructure, as well as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks,\" per the release. \"Agencies that fund life-science projects will establish these standards as a condition of federal funding, creating powerful incentives to ensure appropriate screening and manage risks potentially made worse by AI.\" In short, any developers found in violation of the EO can likely expect a prompt and unpleasant visit from the DoE, FDA, EPA or other applicable regulatory agency, regardless of their AI model\u2019s age or processing speed.\nIn an effort to proactively address the decrepit state of America's digital infrastructure, the order also seeks to establish a cybersecurity program, based loosely on the administration's existing AI Cyber Challenge, to develop AI tools that can autonomously root out and shore up security vulnerabilities in critical software infrastructure. It remains to be seen whether those systems will be able to address the concerns of misbehaving models that SEC head Gary Gensler recently raised.\nAI watermarking and cryptographic validation\nWe're already seeing the normalization of deepfake trickery and AI-empowered disinformation on the campaign trail. So, the White House is taking steps to ensure that the public can trust the text, audio and video content that it publishes on its official channels. The public must be able to easily validate whether the content they see is AI-generated or not, argued White House officials on the press call.\nAdobe\nThe Department of Commerce is in charge of the latter effort and is expected to work closely with existing industry advocacy groups like the C2PA and its sister organization, the CAI, to develop and implement a watermarking system for federal agencies. \u201cWe aim to support and facilitate and help standardize that work [by the C2PA],\u201d administration officials said. \u201cWe see ourselves as plugging into that ecosystem.\u201d\nOfficials further explained that the government is supporting the underlying technical standards and practices that will lead to digital watermarking\u2019 wider adoption \u2014 similar to the work it did around developing the HTTPS ecosystem and in getting both developers and the public on-board with it. This will help federal officials achieve their other goal of ensuring that the government's official messaging can be relied upon.\nCivil rights and consumer protections\nThe first Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights that the White House released last October directed agencies to \u201ccombat algorithmic discrimination while enforcing existing authorities to protect people's rights and safety,\u201d the administration official said. \u201cBut there's more to do.\u201d\nThe new EO will require guidance be extended to \u201clandlords, federal benefits programs and federal contractors\u201d to prevent AI systems from exacerbating discrimination within their spheres of influence. It will also direct the Department of Justice to develop best practices for investigating and prosecuting civil rights violations related to AI, as well as, according to the announcement, \u201cthe use of AI in sentencing, parole and probation, pretrial release and detention, risk assessments, surveillance, crime forecasting and predictive policing, and forensic analysis.\"\nAdditionally, the EO calls for prioritizing federal support to accelerate development of privacy-preserving techniques that would enable future large language models to be trained on large datasets without the current risk of leaking personal details that those datasets might contain. These solutions could include \u201ccryptographic tools that preserve individuals\u2019 privacy,\u201d developed with assistance from the Research Coordination Network and National Science Foundation. The executive order also reiterates its calls for bipartisan legislation from Congress addressing the broader privacy issues that AI systems present for consumers.\nIn terms of healthcare, the EO states that the Department of Health and Human Services will establish a safety program that tracks and remedies unsafe, AI-based medical practices. Educators will also see support from the federal government in using AI-based educational tools like personalized chatbot tutoring.\nWorker protections\nThe Biden administration concedes that while the AI revolution is a decided boon for business, its capabilities make it a threat to worker security through job displacement and intrusive workplace surveillance. The EO seeks to address these issues with \u201cthe development of principles and employer best practices that mitigate the harms and maximize the benefit of AI for workers,\u201d an administration official said. \u201cWe encourage federal agencies to adopt these guidelines in the administration of their programs.\u201d\nRichard Shotwell\/Invision\/AP\nThe EO will also direct the Department of Labor and the Council of Economic Advisors to both study how AI might impact the labor market and how the federal government might better support workers \u201cfacing labor disruption\u201d moving forward. Administration officials also pointed to the potential benefits that AI might bring to the federal bureaucracy including cutting costs, and increasing cybersecurity efficacy. \u201cThere's a lot of opportunity here, but we have to to ensure the responsible government development and deployment of AI,\u201d an administration official said.\nTo that end, the administration is launching on Monday a new federal jobs portal, AI.gov, which will offer information and guidance on available fellowship programs for folks looking for work with the federal government. \u201cWe're trying to get more AI talent across the board,\u201d an administration official said. \u201cPrograms like the US Digital Service, the Presidential Innovation Fellowship and USA jobs \u2014 doing as much as we can to get talent in the door.\u201d The White House is also looking to expand existing immigration rules to streamline visa criteria, interviews and reviews for folks trying to move to and work in the US in these advanced industries.\nThe White House reportedly did not brief the industry on this particular swath of radical policy changes, though administration officials did note that they had already been collaborating extensively with AI companies on many of these issues. The Senate held its second AI Insight Forum event last week on Capitol Hill, while Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to speak at the UK Summit on AI Safety, hosted by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Tuesday.\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images\nAt an event hosted by The Washington Post on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was already arguing that the executive order did not go far enough and could not be considered an effective replacement for congressional action, which to date, has been slow in coming.\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably a limit to what you can do by executive order,\u201d Schumer told WaPo, \u201cThey [the Biden Administration] are concerned, and they\u2019re doing a lot regulatorily, but everyone admits the only real answer is legislative.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Andrew Tarantola, was published by Engadget on 2023-10-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":313}
{"title":"NFL Best Bets Week 9: Colts clobber Panthers, Dolphins drop Chiefs in Germany","context":"## NFL Best Bets Week 9: Colts clobber Panthers, Dolphins drop Chiefs in Germany\n\nThe past few weeks of the 2023 NFL season have reminded us that no matter how smooth you sail to start the voyage, choppy waters will surely come at some point. We started the first six weeks with a best bets winning percentage of well over .700, but we have come crashing back down to Earth over the past two weeks. We love our Week 9 best bets, though, and we're confident that we can all get back on track and make you some cash.\nEvery Friday afternoon, we unveil my favorite moneyline, spread, over\/under, and player prop wagers for the upcoming weekend. We run the gauntlet and handpick the best value opportunities on Caesars and SuperDraft, then tell you exactly how and why you should attack the books to make some money. And through eight weeks, despite some bumps in the road, we have made plenty of money.\nDespite falling three bets under .500 over the past two weeks (5-6 in Week 7, 6-8 in Week 8), our best bets are still 65-46-1 on the season. That's a winning percentage of over .590, a number many professional bettors wish they were maintaining during this rollercoaster of an NFL season.\nAnd, look, last week wasn't all bad as Arnold Schwarzenneger might say. Sure, our ATS picks went 1-3 and our player prop picks went a pitiful 0-3. But our moneyline and over\/under picks went 5-2. So, like the Chiefs after a pathetic loss to the Broncos (one of our incorrect picks last week), we're moving on to Week 9 with our heads held high.\nMORE WEEK 9 BETTING: Against the spread | Moneyline | Top props\nWe don't view sports betting as a gamble. With the right mindset, strategies, and preparedness, we see it as an investment \u2014 and we're loving our return on investment through seven weeks. That's why we don't just call this thing of ours a hobby \u2014 rather, it's a second job that allows us to punch in while we're sitting on our couch.\nYour goal is to boost your bankroll, and our top priority is to help you achieve that goal. That's why we put in a ton of statistical research, attack all the angles, uncover all the betting trends, and pinpoint value across all the sports betting sites each week.\nThis weekend's slate features a plethora of lucrative opportunities for bettors. So, let's go get that money and reveal our best moneyline, spread, over\/under, and SuperDraft player prop bets for Week 9 of the 2023 NFL season.\nJUMP TO: Spreads | Moneylines | Over\/under | Player props\nNFL Best Bets Week 9: Against the spread\nAll odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook\nColts (-2.5) at Panthers\nBryce Young has looked much better now that he has settled into his rookie season with the Panthers, but Carolina still seems like a work in progress. The Colts, meanwhile, have quietly been operating a pretty decent offense \u2014 much better than their three-game losing streak might suggest. Indy has scored 65 points between Week 7 and 8, 29 more points than Panthers have scored in that span.\nIn a Gardner Minshew-Bryce Young battle, we'll take the 'Shew \u2014 and the backfield committee of Jonathan Taylor and Zack Moss against Carolina's abysmal run defense just serves as icing on the proverbial cake. The Panthers have allowed the most rushing TDs (14), the third-most points per game (28.4), and the fourth-most rushing yards per game (139.4) during their 1-7 start. The Colts will cruise in this one.\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Colts 27, Panthers 17\nSeahawks (+6) at Ravens\nBaltimore's defense has been incredible of late, and the Ravens seem to be flying under the radar (so to speak) at 6-2. However, the sportsbooks have clearly taken note of their awesome run, giving the NFC West-leading Seahawks a full touchdown on the road. This seems like a great opportunity for us to rock with the 'dog, considering Seattle has won two straight contests and gone 2-1 on the road (including a big win over the high-flying Lions in Detroit).\nGeno Smith hasn't been the same Pro Bowl QB as he was in 2022, but he has still demonstrated moments of brilliance for Pete Carroll's squad. And with DK Metcalf and Kenneth Walker III a week closer to full health \u2014 and backup RB Zack Charbonnet looking like he's on the verge of a breakout \u2014 we like Seattle to at least make this a game in Baltimore. The 'Hawks defense has quietly been pretty good, and we know what kind of fireworks this offense is capable of when everything's clicking. Take an extra 1.5 points as insurance if you want, but we're taking the Seahawks to cover the +6.\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Ravens 26, Seahawks 23\nOther Week 9 spreads we like: Patriots (-3) vs. Commanders; Raiders -1.5 vs. Giants\nBest NFL moneyline bets Week 9\nDolphins (+110) vs. Chiefs (Germany game)\nWe get it \u2014 the Dolphins have yet to defeat a true contender this season and the Chiefs are the reigning champions of the NFL. However, Kansas City just got its doors blown off by Russell Wilson and the lowly Broncos, a game in which Patrick Mahomes and company suffered five turnovers and three sacks.\nWe expect a statement win from Mike McDaniel and the Dolphins on neutral ground. The Dolphins have been in Frankfurt since early this week, having flown overnight on Monday to give them multiple days to acclimate to the time difference and their surroundings. The Chiefs, meanwhile, waited until after practice on Thursday to take the 11-hour voyage.\nThis also happens to be a revenge game for former Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill, who's on pace for multiple single-season receiving records and poised for his first Offensive Player of the Year award. Oh, and Raheem Mostert, who leads the NFL with 10 TDs and ranks second behind only Breece Hall in yards per carry (5.4), should be licking his chops against a Kansas City D that has surrendered 135.6 rushing yards per game over the past three weeks. Fins up in Frankfurt!\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Dolphins 26, Chiefs 24\nOther Week 9 moneylines we like: Vikings (+170) at Falcons; Bengals (-130) vs. Bills; Cowboys (+140) at Eagles\nBest NFL over\/under bets Week 9\nRaiders vs. Giants: UNDER 37.5\nIt sounds ludicrous to offer an UNDER of 37.5 as a best bet, but this game takes the cake in a Week 9 schedule loaded with underwhelming matchups. The Raiders just fired their head coach and GM and demoted starting QB Jimmy Garoppolo after appearing lost on Monday night, while the Giants just got Daniel Jones back after scoring a combined 33 points across three miserable performances in a row. Oh, and Darren Waller, the G-men's best pass-catcher, is hurt.\nOn top of all that, the Giants and Raiders have both been pretty good on the defensive side of the football as of late, so expect Danny Dimes and Aidan O'Connell to have a tough time finding any kind of rhythm in the passing game. This won't be a fun one to watch, but it should be a fun result for UNDER bettors.\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Raiders 17, Giants 13\nOther Week 9 over\/unders we like: Colts at Panthers: OVER 44; Commanders at Patriots: OVER 41; Saints OVER 25.5 vs. Bears\nMORE BETTING:\nPick'em, Survivor Pool Picks | Chiefs-Dolphins preview | Chargers-Jets MNF preview\nBest NFL player prop bets Week 9\nWin BIG with SuperDraft! Get a free $10 deposit when you use promo code \"TSN\"!\nRashee Rice, Chiefs vs. Dolphins in Germany \u2014 OVER 45.5 receiving yards\nAs soon as I opened up my SuperDraft app, Rashee Rice popped out as the first prop of the first game on Sunday morning (9:30 a.m. in Frankfurt). We love this rookie receiver and the big play ability he has consistently flashed over the past month. During that span, he has averaged over 55 receiving yards per game despite the Chiefs' games being decided by an average of 11.8 points per game.\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS & FANTASY PROPS: How to play SuperDraft\nThis one should be a tightly-contested, high-scoring game \u2014 with heavy playoff implications, because we all know this could be an AFC Championship preview \u2014 so expect Rice to be very busy through all four frames in Frankfurt. The Dolphins have allowed the fifth-most receptions and the 12th-most yards to wideouts this season. If a bounce-back week is meant to be, Sir Rashee is our destiny.\nAustin Ekeler, RB, Chargers @ Jets \u2014 OVER 29.5 receiving yards\nGuess who's back? Back again...Ek is back....tell a friend. The Chargers finally got their best player back to full health, with Ekeler exploding for 123 yards and a TD against the Bears last weekend. A whopping 94 of those 123 yards came through the air, as the PPR god gashed Chicago for chunk yardage a handful of times.\nExpect more of the same from QB Justin Herbert and his stud back against the Jets, who have allowed 46 receiving yards per game to RBs (sixth-most in the NFL). They'll try to shut him down this Sunday, but it would feel so empty without AE!\nJahan Dotson, WR, Commanders @ Patriots \u2014 OVER 45.5 receiving yards\nWe've come full circle with Dotson, who made our preseason sleepers column then faded into early-season obscurity only to emerge again over the past two weeks. Curtis Samuel was clearly not right last week, and the second-year wideout more than made up for it. Dotson caught 8-of-10 targets for 108 yards and a TD, a stellar encore to his Week 7 line of five catches for 43 yards. The banged-up Patriots defense will be primarily focused on stopping stud Commanders receiver Terry McLaurin, which should open up plenty of opportunities for Dotson.\n\nThis article, authored by Sloan Piva, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-03 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":314}
{"title":"Man United next manager: Assessing candidates to replace Erik ten Hag if Red Devils sack Dutch boss","context":"## Man United next manager: Assessing candidates to replace Erik ten Hag if Red Devils sack Dutch boss\n\nAs Manchester United's season continues to slip away, the pressure around Dutch boss Erik ten Hag continues to get more palpable.\nThe latest slip saw the Red Devils crash out of Europe as they fell 1-0 to Bayern Munich on the final day of Champions League group-stage play, finishing bottom of their four-team group to leave them eliminated from Europe in their worst performance in the competition since 2005.\nOn top of that, they set the record for most goals against in a Champions League group stage by an English club, with 15 conceded in their six games. Their defensive record has collapsed as the season goes on: from a Premier League standpoint, they sit eighth in the English top flight, but their -5 goal differential is the worst of any club in the top 10.\nWith Jim Ratcliffe having now completed the formalities around his investment into the club, taking control of 25% of his boyhood club after a year of negotiations, the pressure will be piled on even more. Indeed, Ratcliffe wants United back at \"the very top of world football\".\nThe Sporting News has laid out all the options should Man United move on from Ten Hag and look for a new beginning, in the hopes of salvaging the 2023\/24 season.\nMORE: How Man United produced their worst Champions League group stage in 18 years\nMan United next manager: Assessing candidates to replace Erik ten Hag\nIf Manchester United decide to pull the plug on Erik ten Hag's managerial tenure at Old Trafford, there aren't any perfect options for his replacement.\nThat allows us to speculate some as to who could slot in as the next man hoping to take United back to former glories, which still evade the club since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson over a decade ago.\nZinedine Zidane\nThe former Real Madrid manager has been out of work since departing the Spanish club in 2021, clearly waiting for the right position to open up. He was heavily rumoured to be in line for the France position once the 2022 World Cup finished, but Didier Deschamps surprised many by signing a new contract.\nZidane would be a top choice for United, as he would be for many top clubs with a managerial vacancy, but there's questions around whether he would be open to signing on. The 51-year-old told Marca back in June of 2022 that he isn't exactly thrilled about a Premier League job due to the language barrier.\nWhen asked specifically about a possible job opening in Manchester, Zidane said: \"I understand English, but I don't master it completely. I know that there are coaches who go to clubs without speaking the language, but I work in a different way. Many elements come into play to win. It is a global context.\" Does he still feel the same way?\nGraham Potter\nWhile Potter's time at Chelsea crashed and burned, many still rate the former Brighton & Hove Albion boss highly and he could be in line for a project job such as this. Indeed, there have previously been rumours that Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the INEOS founder on the brink of purchasing a 25 per cent stake in United, would like Potter at the club. He has been out of work since his Blues tenure came to a close back in April, but it would be a hard sell to fans after his time with the London club went so poorly.\nRoberto De Zerbi\nOne of the fastest rising managers in the game, Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi is known for his tactical innovation in transitional play, and his name has cropped up a number of times when big clubs have an opening.\nThe 44-year-old Italian has led the tiny club to new heights, qualifying for the Europa League for the first time in club history and establishing themselves as top-four contenders, building upon the success under Graham Potter. Yet could Potter's failure at Chelsea cause some trepidation around another Brighton success story moving on up?\nMichael Carrick\nThis list wouldn't be complete without mention of the likeliest of those with direct Manchester United links. Former United midfielder Michael Carrick, who made 316 appearances for the club over a 12-year Old Trafford tenure, is at Championship club Middlesbrough, his first permanent managerial appointment. They sit 11th in the second tier as of mid-December, just three points back of the playoff spots in a crowded top half.\nCarrick's lack of experience is glaring, but hiring someone with deep knowledge of the club could be very enticing, and the fact he hasn't bombed in his first job is notable. The 42-year-old has also led the Red Devils before on a caretaker basis, installed back in 2021 after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal and leading the club to some big wins over Arsenal in league play and Villarreal in the Champions League before Ralf Rangnick took over.\nHansi Flick\nThe former German national-team manager only lasted two years on the job with Die Mannschaft, before their failures at the 2022 World Cup caught up with him. Yet Flick has big club experience, having led Bayern Munich first as an assistant under Niko Kovac and then for two years as manager, winning the treble in 2019\/20 en route to being named UEFA Coach of the Year.\nYet Flick's lack of experience of any kind outside Germany \u2014 he has just one year abroad, as an assistant at Red Bull Salzburg \u2014 coupled with his struggles at the national-team level could give some pause at bringing him to England for such a project position.\nAntonio Conte\nFormer Chelsea and Tottenham boss Conte hasn't cropped up near the top of any betting lists, but there could be some sense in hiring the Italian to take over at Old Trafford. Conte has been out of work since his acrimonious departure from Tottenham this past summer, after he seemingly shoved his way out of the club amidst reports he was utterly miserable in London.\nWhile the idea of a control freak such as Conte taking over the Manchester United mess could easily be a recipe for disaster, the club could also seek out a fixer of his nature, hoping for an immediate boost they can build on once things crumble under the Italian, as they often do. Still, the Red Devils would likely have competition as he seems to prefer working in his home country.\nJulen Lopetegui\nFifty-seven-year-old Spanish boss Lopetegui represents maybe the perfect mix of experience, availability, and interest as Manchester United seek out possible new managers. Lopetegui is most known for his time in charge of the Spanish national team, where he succeeded Vincente del Bosque, but he also has big club experience at Real Madrid.\nLopetegui has also managed in the Premier League, seemingly on an upward trajectory at Wolves before abruptly leaving just days before the current season amidst tension with the board. And therein lies the issue around Lopetegui: he has left multiple positions in mysterious and awkward circumstances, with his Wolves exit reminiscent of his departure from the Spanish national team, where he suddenly departed just days before the start of the 2018 World Cup as news of his discussions with Real Madrid came to light. Between those two incidents, and his failed tenures at Madrid and Sevilla, would he be worth the risk at Old Trafford?\nNames that don't make sense as next Man United manager\nJulian Nagelsmann\nWhile the German's name has come up in betting circles as a possibility for the next Manchester United manager, there's no sense to this actually taking place. Nagelsmann was only recently hired as the head coach of the German national team, meaning there's no chance he is available until after Euro 2024 at the earliest, and in that case, it's likely that Germany flopped at their own tournament, meaning his hire would probably be quite sour. This one just doesn't add up.\nLionel Scaloni\nWhile it's conceivable that the Argentine could become available at a moment's notice amid speculation of his potential exit with the defending World Cup champions, this feels an unlikely pairing. Should he indeed leave Argentina, Scaloni has been open about his mental fatigue and is likely to take some time off from management. In the event he does return quickly, he's been heavily linked to Real Madrid as a possible replacement for the Carlo Ancelotti, who is expected to become the next permanent Brazil head coach.\nIt's hard to imagine that Scaloni, who seemingly craves stability and routine, has no experience at club level, and lacks ties to the Premier League or Old Trafford (beyond a brief loan spell with West Ham as a player in 2006) would be a match for Manchester United in any capacity.\nGareth Southgate\nYou can sense a trend here as another currently employed national-team manager is mentioned in England boss Southgate. While he's been linked to the United job before, it would take a perfect storm for him to be installed, whether on a permanent basis or as an interim stopgap option.\nSome believe he could be considered next summer once the Euros are over: it has been speculated that Southgate could leave his England post following next summer's tournament, with his contract expiring in December next year. However, it's also possible he decides to stay on for the 2026 World Cup cycle, particularly if England have a good tournament in Germany. In that instance, he would only be available for double duty on a temporary basis, and that would simply be too messy to outweigh the benefits. Brazil are currently in that boat, and it's all gone wrong for Fernando Diniz despite his Copa Libertadores victory with Fluminense.\nMauricio Pochettino\nIn the event Todd Boehly proves to sport just as itchy a trigger finger as his successor Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, it's possible that Mauricio Pochettino becomes available should Manchester United look to move on from Erik ten Hag. But would he really be a sellable hire, having just failed in London after bombing at PSG and departing Tottenham in acrimonious manner? It seems unlikely that United would be interested in someone who demands significant club control and will have just been fired from a struggling league rival.\nManchester United managers since Sir Alex Ferguson\nIf Manchester United were to appoint a new manager, that person would be the ninth coach to take charge of a United team following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in May 2013, including caretaker\/interim managers Ryan Giggs, Ralf Rangnick and Carrick.\nManager Honours Games David Moyes Community Shield 51 Ryan Giggs (caretaker) \u2014 4 Louis van Gaal FA Cup 103 Jose Mourinho Community Shield, Europa League, League Cup 144 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer \u2014 168 Michael Carrick (caretaker) \u2014 3 Ralf Rangnick (interim) \u2014 29 Erik ten Hag League Cup *\n*Still manager of the club\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Bonn, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-13 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":315}
{"title":"N.F.L. Executives on the Biggest Questions Facing Super Bowl Contenders","context":"## N.F.L. Executives on the Biggest Questions Facing Super Bowl Contenders\n\nCover 7 | Monday A daily NFL destination that provides in-depth analysis of football\u2019s biggest stories. Each Monday, Mike Sando breaks down the six most impactful takeaways from the week.\nThe San Francisco 49ers entered Week 6 riding a 15-game winning streak and looking unstoppable with a young quarterback, Brock Purdy, who was making the game look easy. They exited with a 19-17 defeat at Cleveland, injuries to key players and, for the first time this season, a question mark or two.\nAdvertisement\nWith the previously unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles also losing ugly Sunday, this edition of the Pick Six column addresses key questions facing Super Bowl favorites with one-third of the 18-week regular season nearly complete.\nSo far this season, we\u2019ve seen the Miami Dolphins set NFL records for offense, only to lose by four touchdowns in their lone game against a true contender. We\u2019ve seen the Kansas City Chiefs win with defense, sometimes in spite of their offense. We\u2019ve seen the Buffalo Bills incur devastating injuries. Here we\u2019ll address 10 teams with the shortest Super Bowl odds, running through what I think and what NFL insiders have to say.\nThe full Pick Six menu this week:\n\u2022 Unanswered questions for contenders\n\u2022 When \u201cplaying to win\u201d goes too far\n\u2022 Championship roster, rookie kicker\n\u2022 Do they make wristbands for coaches?\n\u2022 Giants, Vikings and winning too soon\n\u2022 Two-minute drill: Wackiest win in a while\nGO DEEPER The Eagles' 'tush push' play is taking over the NFL. But is it working?\n1. Where do the top 10 current Super Bowl contenders stand one-third of the way through the season? Let\u2019s hit key questions facing the Chiefs, Eagles, 49ers, Bills, Bengals, Cowboys, Ravens, Lions, Dolphins and Jaguars.\nYou can scroll through the latest Super Bowl future odds from BetMGM below.\n\u2022 San Francisco 49ers: What do they have in Purdy?\nWhat I think: Let\u2019s start with what the 49ers do not have in Purdy. They do not have an AFC North-certified, weatherproof Ben Roethlisberger clone able to overpower the elements, break away from defensive linemen and thrive in the conditions Purdy faced against Cleveland. What they do have is a good, young quarterback well-suited to run Kyle Shanahan\u2019s offense at a high level by making quick decisions when given time to find open receivers.\nExec comment: \u201cThe 49ers knew they needed a good quarterback to win the Super Bowl, and they knew they could help Purdy be that. Give him a great receiving tight end, two good receivers and a great halfback who fits the system, and they\u2019ll get someone open on every pass play. But then Deebo Samuel gets hurt, Christian McCaffrey gets hurt, and now we don\u2019t have as many guys open. Especially when you face a defensive coordinator who says, \u2018You show me you can beat me throwing the ball outside the numbers \u2014 best of luck, and to do that, you are going to have to take a five-step drop and I\u2019m going to have Myles Garrett chasing you every play.'\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u2022 Kansas City Chiefs: Is the explosive passing game gone for good?\nWhat I think: The Chiefs have never scored less per game on offense through six games or a full season since Patrick Mahomes became their quarterback. They have also never enjoyed larger average point differentials (9.8 per game), because their defense is so much better. I think the pass offense will become slightly more explosive as Mahomes gets reps with his receivers, but I\u2019m not expecting a huge shift.\nThe Chiefs are averaging 9.5 plays per touchdown drive when starting at least 70 yards from the opponent\u2019s goal line, per TruMedia. That figure was 7.8 in Mahomes\u2019 first year as the starter and has climbed every season since. It\u2019s a testament to the Chiefs\u2019 adaptability, but also a reflection of plummeting explosive play rates.\nExec comment: \u201cYeah, it looks harder for them on offense until Mahomes finds (Travis) Kelce on every major third down, every major two-minute play, every major touchdown. Kansas City has the luxury of their best players being their toughest players. Chris Jones is a very tough player. Kelce is a very tough player. Mahomes is a very tough player. You wonder why they win the games? Because the games are won by the toughest teams most of the time.\u201d\n\u2022 Philadelphia Eagles: Has Jalen Hurts regressed? Where are the explosive pass plays?\nWhat I think: Explosive passing is down through most of the league, including for the Eagles. They are gaining more than 15 yards on just 11 percent of pass plays, down from 21 percent through six games last season and 19 percent for 2022 overall. Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert are still on the team, so I\u2019m inclined to trust the production will return. But there\u2019s also a lingering fear defenses have caught up to aspects of the Eagles\u2019 scheme. Does Philly have a counterpunch?\nAdvertisement\nExec comment: \u201cPeople are going to crush Hurts and the offense. They are just churning the clock so much. It just feels like they are imposing their will on teams through the run game and through their short passing and it just hasn\u2019t taken off from an explosive passing standpoint, so when they play a team that can move the ball on them through the air, it presents some challenges.\u201d\nGO DEEPER Behind the AI magic that lets Amazon's Prime Vision show the NFL like never before\n\u2022 Buffalo Bills: Are the defensive injuries too much to overcome?\nWhat I think: The rest of the conference is the key variable. The Bills are diminished. They have imperfections. But Buffalo already defeated the Dolphins. The other AFC teams aren\u2019t exactly peaking. Kansas City and Cincinnati appear easier to defend this season than in the recent past. We\u2019ll see how well the Dolphins hold up. This can still be Buffalo\u2019s season.\nExec comment: \u201cMatt Milano and Tre\u2019Davious White, those are huge injuries for that football team. The Bills are not as dominant as they felt going into it with so many injuries on defense. But the division they are in, they will still be able to slug it out and get to where they need to go. Nobody has really emerged in the AFC to unseat these teams at the top.\u201d\n\u2022 Miami Dolphins: Has Tua Tagovailoa proven he\u2019s built to last?\nWhat I think: It was tough watching Tagovailoa last season without worrying for his physical well-being. I\u2019ve never felt that way watching him so far this season, and will feel even better if he plays a full game against Philadelphia in Week 7. New England, Kansas City, the Jets (twice), Washington, Tennessee, Dallas, Baltimore and Buffalo will all get their shots at Tagovailoa. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic, but think there will be games when defense muddy the picture sufficiently to create turnovers.\nExec comment: \u201cInteresting team. They put up 70 on Denver and should have put up 70 on the Giants. No one can keep up with that kind of firepower. But they also haven\u2019t really beaten anyone. They were down 14 points to Carolina. Do you think they are coming back from 13 down against Philly? In my opinion, no.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u2022 Dallas Cowboys: Is this team any better than previous Dallas teams that fell short?\nWhat I think: It\u2019s a tough time to evaluate the Cowboys fairly because they were so bad against San Francisco on a big stage in their most recent game. I just don\u2019t see where Dallas is better or going to get considerably better, especially on offense. And every time they enjoy success, they seem to enjoy it a little too much. That is a reflection of their owner.\nExec comment: \u201cRun defense and consistency on defense, and then offensively, what is their identity? They just are not very good. Their best games are when they play great defense and get turnovers, but that is not going to happen enough, especially against the good teams.\u201d\n\u2022 Detroit Lions: Have they fixed their defense?\nWhat I think: The Lions are 11.3 EPA per game better on defense from last season to this season, the second-largest gain for any team since last season. The schedule has something to do with that, but the 2022 defense was so bad, it couldn\u2019t stop Carolina. Detroit will win the NFC North and return to the playoffs, which will make this season successful no matter what happens from there. But we won\u2019t find out until the postseason just how much better the defense might be, because the remaining schedule features so many weak offenses. That includes Chicago twice, Green Bay, Denver and Las Vegas.\nExec comment: \u201cYes, I do buy them. This is a league full of teams who do not really know who they are week to week. Detroit knows who they are, and they play to their identity. Anytime you know who you are and play to that style, you have a chance to be dangerous.\u201d\n\u2022 Baltimore Ravens: Are the Ravens better off shifting to more of a pass-oriented offense?\nWhat I think: Baltimore has never scored fewer points or amassed less offensive EPA through the first six games of a season with Lamar Jackson in the lineup. The schedule and injuries have played roles, but with the Ravens shifting toward a more conventional pass offense, are the explosive quarterback runs mostly in the past? Jackson has one rush longer than 20 yards (he\u2019s had four or five by now previously). He\u2019s gaining at least eight yards on 15 percent of carries, half his previous rate. I\u2019m not expecting a consistent precision passing game to suddenly materialize. Will this new offense be tougher to defend?\nAdvertisement\nExec comment: \u201cThe defense keeps them in it, but I don\u2019t necessarily think this offensive change is going to make them any better when it counts. Lamar Jackson does not appear as dynamic as a runner, but in this offense, he does not need to be. He is regulated to pass from the pocket, but you are taking away the biggest weapon the offense had when you do that. Odell (Beckham) is not that guy anymore. Who are you truly afraid of on that offense? Nobody but Lamar, and if you are not using Lamar in a certain capacity, he becomes just like the rest of these quarterbacks around the league \u2014 hit or miss.\u201d\n\u2022 Jacksonville Jaguars: Are they ready for prime time?\nWhat I think: Trevor Lawrence\u2019s knee injury was the big concern coming out of Sunday. If he\u2019s out, expectations shift dramatically. More than the other AFC contenders, the Jaguars seem early in their life cycle, still finding their way. That makes them a little harder to trust in big spots but also leaves greater space for growth. Let\u2019s hope those test results on Lawrence\u2019s knee come back clear.\nExec comment: \u201cI like Jacksonville. Doug (Pederson) has a championship pedigree. This team is relatively young. They are scrappy. The fact that they have been there before gives them a chance. I think the quarterback is growing.\u201d\n\u2022 Cincinnati Bengals: Can Joe Burrow hold up for a full season?\nWhat I think: Burrow is looking healthier over the past two weeks. The bye week comes at a great time for Burrow to get even healthier, but check out the schedule on the other side: San Francisco, Buffalo, Houston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Jacksonville. Cincy still has a second game with the Steelers, plus games against Kansas City and Cleveland. I\u2019m worried Burrow will wear down against these defenses.\nExec comment: \u201cYou cannot always expect Joe Burrow to create magic with a bottom-half offensive line. The line is my concern all the way.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n2. Are teams sometimes going too far playing to win? The Eagles come to mind after falling 20-14 to the Jets.\nMost would agree teams have gotten smarter in their handling of fourth-down situations, going for it when it makes sense, instead of punting almost out of habit. Making the aggressive play to win can absolutely be the smart play, regardless of results. It\u2019s progress when teams seriously wrestle with these questions, not just on fourth down, but in all aspects of their strategy.\nBut when the Eagles tossed a killer interception on third-and-9 from their own 46-yard line while protecting a 14-12 lead against the Jets with two minutes left in the fourth quarter, a longtime NFL exec reached out with a question: \u201cHave we come too far with coaches wanting to \u2018win\u2019 the game instead of sometimes being more traditional?\u201d\nHis point: Philadelphia could have run the ball on third-and-9, then punted from around midfield. The Jets would have taken possession with barely more than a minute remaining, no timeouts and Zach Wilson behind center facing a ferocious Eagles pass rush. Was having Hurts pass in a situation when gaining a first down is unlikely the smart play under the circumstances?\n\u201cAre coaches not willing to go against the slight statistical benefit that WPA (win probability added) provides?\u201d the exec asked. \u201cIs it no longer OK to let your defense win the game when it clearly has a huge talent\/performance advantage? This Eagles game was 14-12, not 37-35.\u201d\nCritics attuned to the trend toward aggressiveness pounce when teams pass up chances to go for the kill. Coaches know team owners tend to be fans, not football strategists. They know owners listen to these criticisms. That can provide an incentive to make the aggressive play, to go down swinging.\n\u201cEverybody thinks they are playing Brady, Manning or Rodgers in two-minute,\u201d a veteran coach said. \u201cIf before the game someone offered Philly to put its defense against Zach Wilson on a need-field-goal drive starting inside his own 15 with no timeouts and a minute left, you think they would have taken it?\u201d\nIn the situation Sunday, the Jets\u2019 offense had netted 19 yards on its previous three possessions, producing one field goal on a drive that gained 16 of those yards. The Eagles had already suffered three turnovers. They knew Wilson would be taking over deep in his territory with very little time remaining.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cTo me, these are exactly the type of factors that a coach needs to consider when deciding,\u201d the exec said. \u201cI think they were ignored here.\u201d\nThe situation Philly faced against the Jets was the seventh time since 2000 that a team leading by 1-2 points in the final two minutes faced third down with 7-10 yards to go from the minus-40 yard line to midfield, with the opponent holding no timeouts.\nThree of the seven teams passed, resulting in one first down, one sack and Hurts\u2019 interception. Of these three teams, only the Eagles lost the game.\n3. The 49ers lost Sunday when their rookie kicker missed from 41 yards. Is San Francisco wise trusting a championship roster to a rookie\u2019s foot come playoff time?\nThe 49ers raised eyebrows among some when they used their second-highest pick in the 2023 draft \u2014 a third-round choice, 99th overall \u2014 for a kicker. The selection of Michigan\u2019s Jake Moody gave the 49ers a cost-effective successor to veteran Robbie Gould. General manager John Lynch called Moody a potentially \u201cfoundational\u201d player whose stock in the draft was so high, other teams were trying to trade ahead of San Francisco for a shot at him.\nWho do you want lining up the potential winning kick in a Super Bowl? It\u2019s an interesting question in a season that has seen Moody and Saints rookie Blake Grupe miss game-winning tries, but the data could be on the 49ers\u2019 side.\nFGA Dist Rookies Veterans <33 Yds 97% [31-32] 94% [330-351] 34-44 Yds 75% [21-28] 82% [230-279] 45-50 Yds 78% [7-9] 73% [121-165] 51-55 Yds 100% [8-8] 59% [33-56] 56+ Yds 0% [0-1] 55% [6-11] Totals 86% [67-78] 84% [720-862]\nThe table above shows field-goal make rates in the postseason since 2000 for rookie kickers vs. veterans. The numbers stack up pretty evenly across various distance cutoffs. Based on these numbers, there\u2019s no statistical indication rookies are less effective in the postseason.\n\u201cPlayoff teams have a different aura, different feel in the locker room,\u201d a veteran evaluator said. \u201cPercentages are one thing, but who is the guy who trots out there to try the game-winner? It\u2019s a different pressure shooting free throws up by 20, down by 20, than in that type of situation.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nFans might recall rookie kickers missing playoff kicks: Rodrigo Blankenship with the Colts in 2020, Harrison Butker with the Chiefs in 2017, Nate Kaeding with the Chargers in 2005. But the NFL has seen plenty of rookies kick effectively in the postseason as well. Evan McPherson made all 14 postseason tries with the 2021 Super Bowl Bengals. The 2017 Eagles won a Super Bowl with rookie Jake Elliott performing well. The 2012 Super Bowl champion Ravens had rookie Justin Tucker, while the 2006 Patriots trusted rookie Stephen Gostkowski.\n4. Do they make wristbands for head coaches? That is not the only question facing the Broncos.\nDenver Broncos coach Sean Payton has made clear his frustration with quarterback Russell Wilson in myriad ways, including when he suggested Wilson could at some point wear a wristband if it would help speed up communication in the huddle.\nWe joked on the Football GM Podcast that the head coach himself could have used a wristband to assist with game management after the Broncos called timeout before punting with 22 seconds left in the first half of a 19-8 defeat at Kansas City in Week 6. Payton said he thought Denver was heading into third down, not fourth, when he called timeout, helping the Chiefs\u2019 drive to a field goal.\nIt wasn\u2019t an isolated miscue. Denver has twice this season used all three timeouts with at least four minutes remaining before halftime. Payton suffered that fate only four times in 258 total games coaching the Saints, when his association with Drew Brees was one of the most successful partnerships in recent NFL history. Payton has had it happen twice in six games with Wilson as his quarterback.\nRussell Wilson\u2019s hold on the starting job in Denver seems more tenuous with every game. (William Purnell \/ USA Today)\nAcross the league, teams have used all their first-half timeouts above four minutes just 14 times since 2020. That includes six times by Carolina when Matt Rhule coached the Panthers. Payton is the only other coach with more than one such game over the past three-plus seasons.\nThe irony is rich in Denver, where Payton\u2019s predecessor, Nathaniel Hackett, was mocked for his game management so thoroughly, the team made him hire veteran assistant Jerry Rosburg to help him after only three games (Denver was 2-1 at that point). The Broncos under Hackett had trouble getting out of the huddle on time.\nHackett took the hit for those issues, but when the problem recurred under Payton, the blame shifted to Wilson, the common denominator.\nAdvertisement\nAll of this is pointing toward a future in Denver that includes Payton but not Wilson. Payton\u2019s game plans over the past two weeks were conservative enough to suggest the coach was publicly demonstrating he does not think he can run his offense as currently configured, despite some success on the ground. These game plans were conservative enough to signal a potential in-season quarterback change. Denver faces Green Bay and Kansas City over the next two weeks before heading into its Week 9 bye.\n5. You play to win the game, but can you win too quickly? The Giants and Vikings are test cases.\nThe New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings exceeded expectations under first-year head coaches in 2022. Both reached the playoffs. Both are struggling in their second seasons, facing difficult questions about the future. Would they have been better off enjoying only moderate success early? That could depend on how well the football leadership has communicated with ownership.\nEvery head coach and general manager wants to win as much as possible, but the goal is to build for the long term, which can require time to do things with sustainability in mind. Bad teams that win right away can reset expectations for fans and ownership, making it less practical to take one step backward in the short term for a better shot at taking two steps forward down the line.\nWhat do the Giants\u2019 and Vikings\u2019 ownerships think?\n\u201cThe best first year can be that 7-10 season where you show some promise,\u201d a veteran coach with experience on a half-dozen teams said. \u201cThe Giants won a bunch of games early, people were heaping praise on the head coach, people get the expectation of what the quarterback can be. But oftentimes, you know different internally because you know the house you are living in. You are inside the walls every single day and you know where the roof leaks, where the foundation is cracked.\u201d\nBuffalo managed such a situation well. The Bills surprisingly reached the playoffs in their first season under Sean McDermott, a euphoric moment after a 17-year playoff drought. They went 6-10 the next year, then began a steady rise behind Josh Allen and a top defense. There isn\u2019t a Josh Allen on the Giants or Vikings.\nMinnesota in particular finds itself in an interesting spot, with Kirk Cousins approaching free agency and playing well enough, most likely, to keep the Vikings from climbing too high in the draft order.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThey already gave a contract to (tight end) T.J. Hockenson, and they are going to give one to (receiver) Justin Jefferson,\u201d an exec said. \u201cNow, what? Are you going into the rookie pool and taking the fourth-best quarterback in the draft? You can look like Atlanta with (Desmond) Ridder pretty quick.\u201d\n6. Two-minute drill: There were already many ways to win a game before the Dolphins invented another one.\nThe Dolphins were one of 223 teams since 2000 to be favored by at least 13.5 points in a regular-season or playoff game. Seventeen of those 223 teams fell behind by 14 or more. Six of the 17 won anyway. The Dolphins were the only one of those 223 teams to win and cover the spread, which was 13.5 for this game.\n\u2022 Six catches for 163 yards and a touchdown against Carolina left the Dolphins\u2019 Tyreek Hill with 812 yards through the first six games. That ranks second in NFL history to Hall of Famer Don Hutson, who had 819 yards through six with Green Bay in 1942.\nReceiving Yards Through Six NFL Games Rk Player Season Yds 1 Don Hutson 1942 819 2 Tyreek Hill 2023 812 3 Wes Welker 2011 785 4 Elroy Hirsch 1951 766 5 Santana Moss 2005 743 6 DeAndre Hopkins 2015 726 7 Raymond Berry 1960 725 8 Jerry Rice 1986 723 9 Bob Boyd 1954 718 10 Bobby Mitchell 1962 714\n\u2022 Jared Goff is enjoying the second-best start to a season for his career from a statistical standpoint, behind only his 2018 Super Bowl season with the Rams. With the Lions at 5-1 and Goff heading toward a likely contract extension, could another team come after his injured backup, former University of Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker?\nRandy Mueller raised the thought last week, recalling examples from his career as a GM when offering a pick one round higher than a prospect\u2019s actual draft round proved alluring. Detroit used a third-round choice for Hooker, who is recovering from ACL surgery. Hooker would have been valued higher if healthy. Could that be true again at some point in the future?\n\u2022 News that Indianapolis Colts rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson might undergo season-ending shoulder surgery could carry a silver lining. Richardson got to play enough for the Colts to evaluate where he stands, but if he shuts it down for the season, neither he nor the team would have to suffer through a full season of growing pains. Gardner Minshew\u2019s three-pick game against Jacksonville on Sunday works against the idea Indy is better positioned to compete with the journeyman in the lineup, but most coaches and execs I\u2019ve spoken with believe that to be the case in the short term.\n(Top photo: Dustin Satloff \/ Getty Images)\nThe Football 100, the definitive ranking of the NFL\u2019s best 100 players of all time, goes on sale this fall.

{"title":"Fantasy Football RB PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at running back","context":"## Fantasy Football RB PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at running back\n\nHappy December, fantasy friends! We have somehow reached the final week of the fantasy football regular season, so the running back decisions we make in our PPR leagues this week could very well impact our playoff fate. Our Week 14 fantasy RB PPR rankings will help you optimize your lineup at RB1, RB2, and flex heading into this crucial weekend.\nIt hasn't been all holly, jolly this season \u2014 in fact, it has often been a bumpy sleigh ride. We've suffered a plethora of injuries to stud RBs the past few weeks, but we keep rolling with the punches and always do our best to stay two steps ahead of our opponents. One major positive is that only two teams will be on bye this week, a welcome relief after the six-team byepocalypse that was Week 13. Still, the injury-ravaged teams will have trouble replacing their studs and the deep squads will have difficult start 'em, sit 'em decisions to make.\nAs we do every week, we're deep-diving the running back position and analyzing all the stats, matchups, and injuries before breaking down our rankings. So, let's get to it and survey the RB landscape for the final week of the fantasy regular season.\nWhich RBs are on bye in Week 14?\nAfter a whopping six teams were on bye last week, only the Commanders and Cardinals will be off in Week 14. That takes Brian Robinson Jr. and James Conner off the table, but it doesn't hurt us much beyond that.\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nIt does hurt a bit to have two below-average run defenses off the table, as Washington and Arizona have both ranked among the 10 most generous teams to RBs this season.\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWho are the best fantasy RBs in Week 14?\nChristian McCaffrey (vs. Seahawks in Week 14) has given us no reason to stop believing in him as the best overall player in the NFL, so he stays atop this list. Austin Ekeler (vs. Broncos) has started to give us some pause as of late, as he's averaged fewer than 3.0 yards per carry since coming off IR eight games ago, but a juicy home matchup against Denver should be his get-right game. Clear skies ahead, Ek owners \u2014 the Broncos have surrendered the most PPR points in the NFL to RBs, and L.A. faces them twice between now and the fantasy title week.\nWith Jacksonville playing very well over the past month, we're all-in on Travis Etienne Jr. (@ Browns) even in a tough matchup. Trevor Lawrence and his high-flying offense should dominate the time of possession against the Joe Flacco-led Browns, leaving ETN plenty of opportunities to add to his per-game PPR average of 17.4 points (third best in the NFL entering Week 13).\nGuess who's back? Back again? Achane's back \u2014 tell a friend! Stud rookie De'Von Achane (vs. Titans) went right back to roughing up the opposition in his Week 13 return from a knee injury that sidelined him one week prior. The potential league-winner casually put up 103 yards and two TDs on the Commanders, and we can't help but place him and running mate Raheem Mostert in the top five this week despite a somewhat-tough matchup with Tennessee. Mostert has more PPR points than everyone but CMC, while Achane ranks just two spots behind CMC at third in PPR points per game (20.6).\nAnother stud duo, Detroit's Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery (@ Bears), also makes our top 10. They ravaged Chicago when they last met a few weeks ago, combining for a total of 193 yards and two TDs, and we have no reason to think the Lions will slow down in Week 13. Dan Campbell's squad just put 142 rushing yards and 33 points on the Saints in the Bayou this past weekend.\nSpeaking of New Orleans, old PPR reliable Alvin Kamara (vs. Panthers) has been a source of light for an otherwise-dismal Saints offense. With Derek Carr suffering a brutal blow in the Week 13 loss to Detroit, Kamara will likely shoulder the load against Carolina and its atrocious run defense. Entering Week 13, only two teams had allowed more PPR points than the Panthers (28.9 FPPG).\nWe also love Saquon Barkley (vs. Packers) against the Packers' leaky run defense and Breece Hall (vs. Texans) in what should be a bounce-back game. Entering Week 13, Houston had allowed 112.9 scrimmage yards per game and nine total TDs to RBs on the year.\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nWho are the best fantasy RB sleepers, waiver pickups Week 14?\nWelcome to the top 25, Tyjae Spears (@ Dolphins)! We've loved the way this kid has run all season. He averaged 5.1 yards per carry entering last weekend, and he stepped up in a major way for Tennessee when Derrick Henry sustained a game-ending hit to the head area against Indy. Spears contributed 20 yards on the game-tying drive in the fourth quarter and another 27 yards in OT, but Mike Vrabel's squad ultimately lost. In what should be a high-scoring game against the Super Bowl-hopeful 'Fins, we like Spears to be busy as rookie QB Will Levis's top check-down option -- assuming Henry (head\/neck) is out, of course.\nEzekiel Elliott (@ Steelers) is another potential fill-in who should produce at least flex-worthy stats this week. With Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) on the shelf, Elliott could see 20 touches. Similarly, Kenneth Gainwell (@ Cowboys) and Roschon Johnson (vs. Lions) could see big upticks in touches if D'Andre Swift and D'Onta Foreman can't suit up, but we're not as confident those backs can produce given their matchups.\nWe still like Jaylen Warren better overall, but you can confidently take Najee Harris (vs. Patriots) out of the doghouse for good. Harris has been running with purpose, and his role in the passing game continues to make him a high-ceiling RB2 in a run-first offense that will be without Kenny Pickett (ankle) this week. New England might be banged up, but it's still a tough D to get chunk yardage against through the air. Look for Harris to see lots of screens and dump-downs in a rough-and-tumble Thursday night game in Pittsburgh.\nWe love Baltimore's Keaton Mitchell (vs. Rams) and think he has the potential to smash Los Angeles at home this week. The speedster has quietly racked up over 300 yards and two TDs over the Ravens' past four games, and with Lamar Jackson facing Aaron Donald and a still-talented pass-rush, John Harbaugh's squad might turn to the rookie to move the chains between the 20s. All we need is one or two big chunk gains to make him a worthwhile start \u2014 he can run friggin' 22 miles per hour!\nWEEK 14 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nWho are the biggest potential fantasy RB busts in Week 14?\nWhile he just barely cracks our top 25 thanks to his passing-down usage, James Cook (@ Chiefs) doesn't thrill us at Arrowhead against the pissed-off defending champs. Kansas City's front-seven has been tough against speedsters and more vulnerable to power backs, and the 5-11, 190-pound Cook 100 percent falls into the former category. Temper your expectations.\nWe feel the same way about Zach Charbonnet (@ 49ers). It's great that the Week 13 injury he sustained on Thursday night was just a bruise, but it's not great that he now faces a 49ers defense that already stifled him on Thanksgiving. You're probably starting him if Kenneth Walker III remains out with his oblique injury, but consider other options if you have the depth. The floor and ceiling remain low against this uber-confident Niners D.\nTyler Allgeier (vs. Buccaneers) continues to see his role diminish for the NFC South-leading Falcons, with dum-dum coach Arthur Smith finally realizing that Bijan Robinson gives the ATL the best chance at continued success. Tampa Bay has a pretty good run defense, so Allgeier can't be trusted outside of a desperate flex play with his nine average touches over the past two weeks.\nWhat are the biggest RB injuries in Week 14?\nDerrick Henry (head\/neck), Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle), Kenneth Walker III (oblique), Aaron Jones (knee), D'Onta Foreman (ankle), and D'Andre Swift (undisclosed) are all \"questionable,\" at best, to suit up this week. We know for sure Stevenson will be out, but we'll have to monitor the injury reports throughout the week for the rest.\nJonathan Taylor (thumb) underwent surgery last week and will miss the next few weeks, opening the door for Zack Moss to resume his role as Indy's super-sub lead back.\nWe'll be updating these RB PPR rankings all week, so check back for the latest player movement.\nFantasy RB PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, sit at running back\nRankings based on full-point PPR scoring formats\nRank Player\n1 Christian McCaffrey, 49ers vs. Seahawks\n2 Austin Ekeler, Chargers vs. Broncos\n3 Travis Etienne, Jaguars @ Browns\n4 De'Von Achane, Dolphins vs. Titans\n5 Raheem Mostert, Dolphins vs. Titans\n6 Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions @ Bears\n7 Alvin Kamara, Saints vs. Panthers\n8 Saquon Barkley, Giants vs. Packers\n9 David Montgomery, Lions @ Bears\n10 Breece Hall, Jets vs. Texans\n11 Bijan Robinson, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n12 Josh Jacobs, Raiders vs. Vikings\n13 Rachaad White, Buccaneers @ Falcons\n14 Tony Pollard, Cowboys vs. Eagles\n15 Kyren Williams, Rams @ Ravens\n16 Joe Mixon, Bengals vs. Colts\n17 Javonte Williams, Broncos @ Chargers\n18 Derrick Henry, Titans @ Dolphins\n19 D'Andre Swift, Eagles @ Cowboys\n20 Jaylen Warren, Steelers vs. Patriots\n21 Alexander Mattison, Vikings @ Raiders\n22 Jerome Ford, Browns vs. Jaguars\n23 Kenneth Walker III, Seahawks\n24 Najee Harris, Steelers vs. Patriots\n25 James Cook, Bills @ Chiefs\n26 Zack Moss, Colts @ Bengals\n27 Keaton Mitchell, Ravens vs. Rams\n28 AJ Dillon, Packers @ Giants\n29 Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots @ Steelers\n30 Aaron Jones, Packers @ Giants\n31 Jerick McKinnon, Chiefs @ Bills\n32 Tyjae Spears, Titans @ Dolphins\n33 Gus Edwards, Ravens vs. Rams\n34 Dameon Pierce, Texans @ Jets\n35 Roschon Johnson, Bears vs. Lions\n36 Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Chiefs @ Bills\n37 Kareem Hunt, Browns vs. Jaguars\n38 Tyler Allgeier, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n39 Chuba Hubbard, Panthers @ Saints\n40 Devin Singletary, Texans @ Jets\n41 D'Onta Foreman, Bears vs. Lions\n42 Chase Brown, Bengals vs. Colts\n43 D'Ernest Johnson, Jaguars @ Browns\n44 Jaleel McLaughlin, Broncos @ Chargers\n45 Miles Sanders, Panthers @ Saints\n46 Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks @ 49ers\n47 Dalvin Cook, Jets vs. Texans\n48 Joshua Kelley, Chargers vs. Broncos\n49 Royce Freeman, Rams @ Ravens\n50 Jeff Wilson Jr., Dolphins vs. Titans\n51 Ty Chandler, Vikings @ Raiders\n52 Latavius Murray, Bills @ Chiefs\n53 Cordarrelle Patterson, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n54 Justice Hill, Ravens vs. Rams\n55 Rico Dowdle, Cowboys vs. Eagles\n56 Kenneth Gainwell, Eagles @ Cowboys\n57 Khalil Herbert, Bears vs. Lions\n58 Tank Bigsby, Jaguars @ Browns\n59 Samaje Perine, Broncos @ Chargers\n60 Chase Edmonds, Buccaneers @ Falcons\n61 Boston Scott, Eagles @ Cowboys\n62 Matt Breida, Giants vs. Packers\n63 Jamaal Williams, Saints vs. Panthers\n\nThis article, authored by Sloan Piva, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-07 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":317}
{"title":"The small and affordable EVs we lost in 2023","context":"## The small and affordable EVs we lost in 2023\n\nSeveral would-be antidotes to the supersized and high-priced EV trend kicked the bucket this year. That\u2019s bad news for everyone, even if you\u2019d pick a beefy Cybertruck over something resembling a teeny Kei car.\nCars in general are no substitute for more efficient modes of transportation, including trains and bikes. But the last thing the climate and most budgets need is another tank-like truck or SUV. Large, heavy electric vehicles demand more materials and energy than smaller EVs; that means more avoidable greenhouse gas emissions during and after production. Despite these downsides, automakers build big because big sells.\nNumerous vehicles from startups and some legacy automakers challenge the \u201cbigger is better\u201d notion via compact designs and smaller price tags. Yet, little typically comes of their resistance. We observed as much with several ill-fated EVs this year, including the ElectraMeccanica Solo, Sono Sion and Mazda MX-30.\nHere we\u2019ll take a look at the small and low(er)-priced EVs that didn\u2019t make it \u2014 the flops, the failures to launch, the u-turns and holdouts of North America\u2019s size- and range-obsessed EV market.\nElectraMeccanica Solo\nLegally a motorcycle, ElectraMeccanica\u2019s tiny EV featured one seat, 100 miles of range and an $18,500 price tag. The automaker pitched the three-wheeled vehicle to city dwellers and delivery fleet managers alike. I never got to drive a Solo, but I sat inside one of these cuties last year and found it claustrophobic with the doors shut.\nIn April, ElectraMeccanica recalled every Solo over power failure issues. At the time, the company said it was pivoting to four-wheeled vehicles. ElectraMeccanica soon entered into a plan to merge with electric truck maker Tevva. In October, ElectraMeccanica inexplicably pulled the plug on that exit.\nHonda e\nThe Honda e debuted in Europe and Japan in 2020 with a 100-mile range and a $36,000-$43,000 price tag. The vehicle charmed reviewers with its city-friendly size and sweet-yet-vacant stare. Yet, as far as sales went it proved to be a total flop, thanks in no small part to its weak price-to-range ratio. Honda never brought the e to other locales, and by December this year, the automaker said it would cease production of the little buggy in January 2024.\nSono Sion\nGerman automaker Sono once led the charge to bring solar panels to electric cars with the five-seater Sono Sion hatchback. Sono priced the Sion (unrelated to Toyota\u2019s Scion badge) at $25,000 and intended to kick off production in 2023.\nInstead, Sono pivoted to selling to third-party automakers and laid off 300 workers. No longer an automaker, Sono now focuses on embedding its solar tech into other vehicles.\nGM, Honda\u2019s affordable EVs\nGeneral Motors and Honda said in April 2022 that they\u2019d co-develop millions of small and affordable EVs. They teased sub-$30,000 electrics for North America, aiming to deliver them in 2027.\nYet by October 2023, they canned the collaboration, vaguely citing \u201cextensive studies and analysis\u201d to explain the move. The announcement came as GM slowed its transition to EVs and Honda teased a \u201cnew global EV series\u201d of its own.\nMazda MX-30 (U.S.)\nThe Mazda MX-30 is small by Cybertruck standards (Tesla\u2019s vehicle is 25% longer and wider), but the only truly diminutive thing about the MX-30 is its 100-mile range and availability. Stateside, Mazda exclusively sold the MX-30 in California, the state with the most EV chargers by a factor of five.\nMazda said in July that it planned to discontinue the EV in the U.S. at the end of 2023. However, the automaker will continue selling the EV in Japan and the EU.\nRevel mopeds\nRevel \u2014 the Blackrock- and Shell-backed moped-sharing business \u2014 dumped its two-wheeled EVs this year in favor of regular-old electric cars. Revel said its moped ridership peaked in July 2020, at nearly 600,000 rides that month. In the years that followed, the company\u2019s moped ridership collapsed amid several deaths involving Revel mopeds, as e-bikes gained ground in cities like New York and San Francisco.\nVanMoof\nDutch e-bike startup VanMoof rode the high of the COVID-19-era bike boom into a $128 million Series C funding round. VanMoof proclaimed at the time that it was the \u201cmost funded e-bike company in the world,\u201d and co-founder Taco Carlier boasted the company was \u201creinventing, redesigning, and re-engineering every component of the bicycle.\u201d\nVanMoof\u2019s rapid growth and focus on proprietary parts led to its downfall. By 2023, the company reportedly lost money on each bike due to costly repairs, and struggled to raise additional funds to stay afloat. This past summer, VanMoof paused sales and Taco Carlier left as the firm declared bankruptcy.\nElectric scooter maker Lavoie acquired what was left of VanMoof in August for \u201ctens of millions,\u201d pulling it out of bankruptcy. Months later, it seems the acquirer has yet to restart VanMoof production or resume repairs.\nOn the other hand\nIt\u2019s been a bummer year for fans of small EVs, but all is not lost. For one, city bike-sharing programs are booming and increasingly electric. D.C.\u2019s Capitol Bikeshare notched a record 428,000 rides in the month of may. That same month, New York\u2019s Citi Bike recorded 867,838 rides in a single week \u2014 and the program continues to expand.\nBeyond e-bikes, Arcimoto lives on as the rare, three-wheeled EV holdout in the U.S. The Fiat 500e is coming to North America in 2024 (in limited quantities), several years after its debut in the EU. A startup called Telo Trucks is attempting to prove that Americans will buy small trucks again, and it\u2019s developing a pickup with the footprint of a two-door Mini Cooper. Plus, while GM said it would kill the Chevy Bolt and larger Bolt EUV, the automaker now says it will keep the latter Bolt around.\n\nThis article, authored by Harri Weber, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-19 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":318}
{"title":"Trump and the GOP are trying to drive a wedge between autoworkers and EVs","context":"## Trump and the GOP are trying to drive a wedge between autoworkers and EVs\n\nLast night, former President and current Republican frontrunner Donald Trump appeared before a crowd in suburban Detroit and tried out his new attack lines against electric vehicles.\nEVs are too expensive, the former president argued (via The Detroit News); they don\u2019t have enough range and will spur American job losses. EV batteries were another target. \u201cThey get rid of them,\u201d Trump said, according to Discourse Blog, \u201cand lots of bad things happen, and when they\u2019re digging it out of the ground to make those batteries, it\u2019s going to be very bad for the environment.\u201d But those trying to protect the environment by promoting EVs are \u201cenvironmental lunatics,\u201d he said.\nHis comments were the latest attempt to make electric vehicles a major wedge issue in American politics. President Joe Biden has made EVs a major part of his environmental legacy, and Trump senses that the issue could be used to leach support from working-class voters. But like most other recent efforts by Republicans to politicize EVs, it\u2019s largely incoherent and ignores the nuanced reality of how most autoworkers feel about EVs.\nThe latest attempt by Trump and his GOP brethren to make electric vehicles a major wedge issue in American politics\nThe latest wrinkle to this effort is the United Auto Workers of America strike, which has roiled Detroit and the surrounding area for the last two weeks and sent candidates from both parties scrambling to shore up support among workers. The strike is a watershed moment for the auto industry, with workers pushing for higher wages, improved job security, and more manageable hours. EVs are also on the table, with UAW President Shawn Fain calling for a \u201cjust transition\u201d to electric cars.\nWhat\u2019s clear, though, is that union members aren\u2019t really buying what either party is selling. Workers may agree with Trump that EVs are too expensive or that the charging infrastructure isn\u2019t up to snuff, but they also don\u2019t want to see it stopped dead in its tracks. They also have concerns about Biden\u2019s efforts to accelerate EV production by providing incentives to automakers to retrofit factories and to car buyers through generous tax credits.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people that are frustrated, just with all of them,\u201d Aaron Westaway, a UAW member from outside Detroit, told E&E News. \u201cNobody\u2019s happy with Trump, nobody\u2019s happy with Biden.\u201d\nThe concerns among union workers reflect the attitudes of most Americans, writ large. According to Pew Research, 50 percent of US adults say they are unlikely to buy an EV, while 38 percent said they were likely to consider a battery-powered vehicle. Concerns about charging and range are at the top of the list. But environmental concerns also rank high, with many people saying they would consider an EV as a way to reduce carbon emissions.\nWhat often goes unsaid about autoworkers and their attitudes about EVs is where the money is flowing. And right now, much of it is going to factories and plants outside their strongholds in the Midwest. Ford is building a massive battery plant in Tennessee, for example, as a joint venture with Korean battery maker SK Innovation. Meanwhile, workers at a General Motors joint venture battery plant in Ohio overwhelmingly voted in favor of unionizing under the UAW late last year, in a major win for the union.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s happy with Trump, nobody\u2019s happy with Biden.\u201d\nIf more factories follow their lead, and more of the EV transition is being meted out on the union\u2019s terms, it\u2019s likely worker attitudes will shift in favor of electrification. But right now, most of the work on electric vehicles is being done by non-union labor. And experts say that needs to change in order for opinions to soften.\n\u201cWhat this industry narrative about UAW\u2019s demands costing too much alongside the EV transition seems to neglect is the fact that auto companies are getting billions of dollars from taxpayer-funded EV subsidies to make it work,\u201d Sydney Ghazarian, an organizer with the climate-focused Labor Network for Sustainability, said on the Citations Needed podcast recently. \u201cIt\u2019s their responsibility to use public funding in ways that serve the public and planetary good, you know, and central to that is not leaving workers and communities behind in the transition to a green economy.\u201d\nGhazarian argued that Trump and the GOP\u2019s attacks on EVs smacks of \u201cfaux populism\u201d since Republicans largely stand opposed to unionization. When he was president, Trump appointed anti-union judges and anti-union members to the National Labor Relations Board. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court judges also issued rulings that were devastating to public sector unions. And his promises to prevent auto factories from shutting down largely failed.\nStill, Biden has his work cut out for him as he seeks to shore up support among working-class families. Biden became the first modern president to visit a picket line this week when he stood alongside striking UAW members in Wayne County, Michigan. Biden told workers they \u201cdeserve a significant raise,\u201d citing the record profits made by the Big Three automakers, Ford, GM, and Stellantis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s their responsibility to use public funding in ways that serve the public and planetary good\u201d\nBut his efforts to frame the EV transition as good for workers as it will be for the environment is still a work in progress. Striking UAW members may be skeptical about whether EVs are affordable or practical enough for themselves, but that reflects widely held attitudes about the rapid shift to electric. And that skepticism can\u2019t be ignored \u2014 which is why the Biden administration is prioritizing billions in federal funding for the installation of a robust EV charging network.\nAffordability is still a major concern, but vehicle prices are going up across the board, both for EVs and for gas vehicles. And automakers are still losing billions of dollars each year on EVs, with their gas-vehicle profits being redirected into the enormous investments needed to fund the transition.\nWhat is clear is that nothing is likely to stop the EV train now that it\u2019s in motion. The automakers are committed, and UAW leadership wants to ensure that workers get to share the profits. And China looms large over everything, with the country producing the bulk of the components that go into EVs \u2014 a major concern of the union.\nWhat isn\u2019t clear is whether Trump\u2019s plan to drive a wedge between autoworkers and environmentalists will pay off. In his speech Wednesday, Trump tried to play up the division, heaping blame on Biden and the Democrats for the uncertainty around EVs.\n\u201cThe auto industry is being assassinated,\u201d Trump said, according to Detroit News. \u201cIf you want to buy an electric car, that\u2019s absolutely fine. I\u2019m all for it. But we should not be forcing consumers to buy electric vehicles they don\u2019t want to buy.\u201d\nBut he also cast the union\u2019s strike as largely pointless and, in a major head-scratcher, said that autoworkers would likely be out of work in a few years anyway, so why bother? \u201cYou\u2019re all on picket lines and everything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference what you get because, in two years, you\u2019re all going to be out of business.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Andrew J.

We test dozens throughout the year. Check out our Best Laptops, Best Cheap Laptops, Best Linux Laptops, and Best Gaming Laptops guides for more options.\nNintendo Switch OLED Photograph: Nintendo\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) typically sells for $349, but this bundle includes a digital download of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as well as a three-month Nintendo Switch Online membership. Those extras usually cost $60 and $10, respectively, so it's like you're getting $70 worth of bonuses for free.\nWe like the 14-inch version of this laptop, which features most of the same components. You get an AMD Ryzen 7 (7730U) processor, 16 gigabytes of RAM, and 512 gigabytes of storage with a 16-inch touchscreen. That's plenty of power for just about everything, and the large screen is nice for editing photos and browsing the web. It's not a good choice if you're a video editor or gamer, but it'll do for the rest of us.\nThis is the newer, faster version of one of our top picks in our Best Cheap Laptops guide. You're getting a newer Intel chip (13th gen i5), more RAM (16 gigabytes, a must-have with Windows 11), and a nicer IPS display all for the same price as the pick in our guide. Again, it's not a gaming rig, but it's fast enough for everyday tasks like browsing the web and editing documents.\nPhotograph: Amazon\nThis is a good deal on an excellent controller, and the price extends to several different color options. Our favorite part about the DualSense controller is the way the haptic feedback works. Rather than random rumbles, you'll feel directional and immersive feedback\u2014almost like surround sound, but in a controller.\nNearly any monitor can be rotated to be a vertical monitor, and we love them for a work-from-home setup. However, the LG DualUp is made to be vertical and comes with a wider aspect ratio (16:18) to accommodate its upright lifestyle. You'll see less content cut off, and it isn't as narrow on your eyes.

This 4.5-quart bowl model is slightly less powerful than some, but it's still strong enough to knead dough, cream butter, and whip up big batches of holiday cookies.\nAs a mid-level model in Dyson's lineup, the V12 Detect Slim (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) has a few bells and whistles, such as an LCD screen that allows you to select one of three power levels and see the remaining battery level and filter and blockage information, among other things. Like all of Dyson's stick vacuums, it's lightweight and easy to maneuver around tight homes.\nThis is our favorite cordless vacuum. Aside from reliable suction power, even on corrugated surfaces, it also stands on its own\u2014a feature you'd think more cordless vacuums would have, but it's surprisingly rare. The Extreme Max converts to a hand vac in a few moments and comes with three attachments.\nDyson is a master of wedging function into beautiful form. When we tested the Pure Hot + Cool, we were struck by how well it integrates a fan, electric heater, and air purifier into one. It's capable of filtering out 99.97 percent of particles 0.3 microns in size, and its built-in air quality monitor displays indoor VOC and particulate levels on a bright, easy-to-read display.\nPhotograph: Bissell\nThis is a match of the lowest price we tend to see for this little green machine. It made our list of the Best Carpet Cleaners and the Best Viral TikTok Gadgets. It's great for cleaning furniture, stairs, and vehicles.\nLow on caffeine\u2014and counter space? The K-Express is a mere 6.5 inches wide and 12 inches deep, yet its 36-fluid-ounce, removable reservoir holds enough water to make a round of coffee for you and your friends without having to constantly refill it. Just do the planet a solid and make sure to use Keurig Reusable Pods to cut down on single-use plastic waste.\nA good budget espresso machine is a rare find, but this one is our favorite. You'll get a solid portafilter, a reliable steam pump, and a steaming wand in a pretty compact body. Unlike other cheap machines we tried, the Stilosa didn't show signs of slowing down. I (Medea) was gifted this after I got married and it's easy to use whether I want to brew espresso or just stream milk for my coffee, and it takes up very little room on our counter.\nIt might look like a coffee maker, but the Ninja Creami (6\/10, WIRED Review) makes ice cream. It isn't essential, but it's a fun kitchen tool if you're interested in experimenting with your own sorbets and ice cream recipes.

When we called the QN900C (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) \u201camong the prettiest you can buy,\u201d we gushed over the \u201cbrilliantly clear and detailed video,\u201d rich color shading, deep blacks, and butter-smooth motion processing. It\u2019s able to display up to 8K resolution, so your only issue (aside from the price) may be finding enough 8K content to show on it.\n\u201cAbsolutely loaded with detail.\" That's how WIRED associate reviews editor Parker Hall describes the picture quality of the C3, with vivid, high-contrast images playing out across the 4K display. Stunningly fast response times of 9.2 milliseconds and support for every current-generation console feature, by way of its four HDMI sockets, justified crowning the C3 as the Best TV for Gamers.\nWe call this our best TV for gamers for a reason: It has a lightning-fast response time of 9.2 milliseconds, and it has four HDMI 2.1 ports to connect your PC, Xbox, Playstation, and Switch. Outside of gaming, it works fantastically well as a TV, with perfect black levels, and a great center mount that helps you place it on existing TV stands.\nExtra large OLED TVs typically come with extra large price tags. This LG model is one of the rare deals that lets you have both top-tier image quality and a massive display at a reasonable cost. Perfect black levels and gorgeous HDR make this one of the best TVs for larger rooms, especially if you like darker movies and shows.\nPhotograph: Walmart\nWe've always liked Samsung's Frame models because they hide in plain sight. When you're not using them, the TV transforms into one of a myriad of famous art pieces, virtually disappearing into the decor. This is an especially large one, but it's perfect for a fancy living room where you don't want the TV to always be the center of attention. The 55-inch model is also on sale.\nAt its full retail price, the XR A90J faces stiff competition from the likes of LG and Samsung, but at this shockingly discounted price, you're arguably getting the best deal in premium-yet-affordable TVs, at least for the next few days while it's on sale. It features Sony's 4K upscaling to make HD shows and films appear as if they're in 4K resolution plus built-in Google TV.\nBose\u2019s Smart Soundbar 600 is a Mighty Mouse Dolby Atmos soundbar that offers clear and expansive sound from a strikingly small frame. Unlike a lot of soundbars at this price, Bose\u2019s model includes real up-firing drivers for immersive overhead effects, alongside good musicality, relatively punchy bass, and great network streaming features in a sleek and compact design.\nSony is best known these days for its OLED screens, but its LED TVs like the X90L still pack a punch with a mix of excellent picture processing, good brightness, and great local dimming for rich contrast. Like a lot of TVs this time of year, this 65-inch set is at the lowest price we've seen it all year.\nPhotograph: JBL\nThis versatile multi-piece soundbar system from JBL (8\/10 Wired Recommends) not only offers some of the best Dolby Atmos immersion you can buy but it\u2019s also got a cool trick: fully wireless surround sound speakers. You can set them up behind you or even use them as Bluetooth speakers, then connect back to the main bar for charging and playback.\nKlipsch has a talent for crafting soundbars that put the sound first, often without a lot of frills, and the Cinema 600 is an excellent example. Built from a speaker-like MDF cabinet and paired with a massive 10-inch subwoofer driver, this system has a penchant for clear and powerful sound that\u2019s as good for music as it is for cinematic punch.\nPhotograph: Polk Audio\nPolk\u2019s Audio Signa 4 (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) was already one of the most affordable Dolby Atmos soundbars of its kind, offering true up-firing drivers, a wireless subwoofer for beefy bass, and generally pleasing performance. It\u2019s all the tougher to pass up at this price, perfect for those seeking a no-nonsense system that easily upgrades your sound in a simple package.\nSony\u2019s HT-A5000 is a pricey proposition at full cost, but it\u2019s a killer deal at this price thanks to engulfing surround sound expansion and just about all the features you can pack into a bar this size.

It comes equipped with three tweeters and eight mid-woofers to deliver deep bass, along with full Dolby Atmos support that can bounce sound off walls and ceilings in a way that mimics a surround sound setup. It was on sale for the same price during holiday sales last year, but it's the lowest we've tracked.\nThe Beam (Gen 2) offers enhanced sound with support for Dolby Atmos (with compatible TVs and streaming apps), a fast processor, and an HDMI eARC port for high-definition audio. There's support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and AirPlay 2 as well. For surround sound, you can also pair it with other Sonos speakers.\nBose has updated its Smart 900 soundbar to include better bass extension, helping fortify an already great sound profile. With true up-firing drivers, the system also provides expansive Dolby Atmos and virtual surround sound for a cinematic performance from a single unit, and this is the first time we've seen its price drop.\nBelieve it or not, this is the lowest price we've seen on this luxury Sennheiser model that's as much trapeze artist as soundbar thanks to its high-flying virtual surround sound and Dolby Atmos tricks. It's a hefty unit and doesn't include a separate subwoofer, but still manages to serve up punchy grooves, sweet and smooth musicality, and great convenience features like Wi-Fi streaming and an analog input at a price that's finally swung below the stratosphere.\nSamsung\u2019s HW-Q800C offers a lot from a two-piece system. Its mix of upfiring Dolby Atmos speakers and side-firing drivers provides an engaging cinematic experience while its wireless subwoofer adds a hefty punch to effects and streaming music that many competitors can\u2019t match.\nJump to a Topic: PC and Gaming Deals, Home and Kitchen Deals, TV Deals, Watch and Fitness Tracker Deals, Headphone and Earbud Deals, Smart Home Deals, Speaker Deals\nWatch and Fitness Tracker Deals\nNot sure which is for you?

They\u2019ll likely drift back into the red this quarter as the rates they charge fall below costs and look to stay there for the foreseeable future.\nBooms-turned-busts have been more abrupt and sensational, but rarely has an established industry so tied to the global economy lurched from historic profits to below break-even levels more directly than the shipping lines that move 80% of the world\u2019s merchandise trade have this year. After Covid\u2019s massive demand shock, the culprit now is too much supply.\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly concerned about the next 24 to 36 months,\u201d Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive officer of Hamburg-based Hapag-Lloyd AG, said in an interview last week. \u201cWe are going to see a downturn.\u201d\nConsider the tougher times facing A.P. Moller-Maersk A\/S, the largest publicly traded container line. According to Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst Stephane Kovatchev, the Copenhagen-based company\u2019s free cash flow, which reached $27 billion last year, may drop about 80% this year and could turn negative in 2024. That may weigh on the company\u2019s bonds, he wrote in a research note on Friday.\nRead More: Maersk Slumps After Forecasting Weak Global Trade Until 2026\nOver the past 10 days, Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd and closely held CMA CGM SA of France \u2014 all top-five players that together control about one-third of the world\u2019s container capacity \u2014 said they\u2019re cutting costs as some fear the slump will last at least through 2024.\nSome executives are urging against price wars, which contributed to a wave of consolidation and at least one major bankruptcy in the years leading up to the pandemic.\n\u201cEach actor will have to be responsible to ensure that the market remains reasonable amid rates that are relatively low,\u201d CMA CGM Chief Financial Officer Ramon Fernandez told reporters Friday. \u201cPrice wars after a while hurt not only those who start them but everyone.\u201d\nRead More: Shipping Giant CMA CGM Warns Against Price War as Profit Plunges\nSuch concern stems from a combination of economic forces: Goods demand is returning to pre-pandemic levels just as supply is rising in the form of new, bigger ships. It can take two to three years to build a container ship, which typically operate for about 25 years. So timing their launch and retirement with the ebbs and flows of the business cycle is inherently difficult.\nTo manage capacity in the short term, the main tools at the carriers\u2019 disposal are canceling individual voyages or suspending services entirely on trade lanes where demand is weak. In prolonged slumps they can also let charter contracts expire, idle some ships or sell old ones in the scrap steel market.\nKovatchev said what\u2019s emerging is a standoff between the strong and the weak. \u201cThe bigger companies such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have the cash to wait and focus on cost-cutting, as opposed to aggressive capacity reductions \u2014 for now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all boils down to supply, demand and who will blink first.\u201d\nOf course, the flipside of shipping\u2019s pain are lower costs for the manufacturers and retailers that own the cargo being transported, which ultimately helps central bankers tasked with bringing down still-elevated inflation across many developed economies.\n\u201cA couple years ago, it was double-digit inflation in goods prices and maybe a 4% or 5% increase in services,\u201d said Phil Levy, chief economist at Flexport Inc., a San Francisco-based digital freight-forwarding company. \u201cTo the extent you were getting inflationary pressure from goods, or in a very tight goods market \u2014 that has disappeared.\u201d\nCompanies including clothing brand Under Armour Inc. and furniture maker Lovesac Co. cited relief from lower ocean shipping expenses over the past quarter.\nWith inflation eating away at their paychecks, consumers are being cautious about spending and seeking cheaper ways to have parcels delivered.\n\u201cOur own data tells us that the wider economic picture may be having an influence on the services our customers opt for, with many looking for more cost-effective shipping options,\u201d said Karen Reddington, president of FedEx Express Europe. \u201cWe expect external business conditions to be challenging in the near term, and there remains uncertainty with respect to the timing of demand recovery.\u201d\nRead More: Powell Says Fed to Be Careful, Won\u2019t Hesitate to Hike If Needed\nFor the container carriers, the cost of moving merchandise can\u2019t stay this low indefinitely, because their expenses are heading in the opposite direction.\nTransiting the Suez Canal from Asia next year, for instance, will be 15% costlier, the waterway\u2019s authority said in mid-October without explanation. On the other main trade route, ships passing through the drought-stricken Panama Canal are facing long waits, surcharges, and time- and fuel-consuming detours around South America to avoid the delays.\nThose costs are small compared with the $1 trillion in investment the industry faces in the coming decades to decarbonize \u2014 a shift that will require engines that run on cleaner-burning fuels and new infrastructure to produce, store and transport the alternative fuels.\nThe big European carriers have issued estimates for the surcharges that\u2019ll take effect with shipping\u2019s upcoming entry into the European Union\u2019s Emissions Trading System in January.\nAt CMA CGM, one of the strategies to cushion the peaks and valleys of shipping is to diversify. The second-generation scion Rodolphe Saade, who leads the company started by his father, has used the pandemic windfall to invest in an airline, ports and logistics operations and even the media.\nThe Saade family is worth about $19 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That compares with $33 billion in April.\n\nThis article, authored by Brendan Murray, Tara Patel, Bloomberg, was published by Fortune on 2023-11-12 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":321}
{"title":"Alcoholism, Ayahuasca and the Enlightenment of an N.F.L. Player","context":"## Alcoholism, Ayahuasca and the Enlightenment of an N.F.L. Player\n\nLAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. \u2014 The Buffalo Bills have a new safety this season.\nHe sometimes plays close to the line of scrimmage, even lining up in the gaps and banging helmets with interior linemen. They use him as a hybrid linebacker in a three-safety dime package. He has played free safety, strong safety, outside cornerback, inside cornerback, left linebacker and right linebacker. And more.\nAdvertisement\nPhysically and mentally, he is being challenged, but he\u2019s grateful, content and all in.\nThe Bills\u2019 new safety is Jordan Poyer. It\u2019s the same Jordan Poyer who played for the team the previous six seasons, the only player in the NFL to have 500 or more tackles, 20 or more interceptions and 10 or more sacks in that time frame, a Bills captain for the fourth time, an Ed Block Courage Award winner in 2017, a Pro Bowl safety last year and an All-Pro the year before.\nBut this is a new Jordan Poyer because of ayahuasca.\nIn the spring of 2020, NFL team facilities were closed because of COVID-19, so Bills defenders met in Washington, D.C., for a few days to train, study and bond.\nThe first evening, cornerback Josh Norman welcomed the players to his home, and out came the shots of tequila. When Poyer was handed a shot, he looked at it and then at his teammates.\nHe put it down.\nNorman and the others, who had never seen him turn down a drink, were taken aback.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d one said. \u201cCome on, Deejay Poyo!\u201d\nDeejay Poyo was Poyer\u2019s alter ego. Inspired by tequila and a turntable, Poyer became someone else. And for Poyer, there was value in being someone else.\nWhat his teammates didn\u2019t know was that Poyer had not put alcohol to his lips in about three months, since he downed a shot of tequila on March 13 in the Puerto Vallarta airport bar during a 12-hour flight delay.\nPoyer spent his childhood in Astoria, Ore., a picturesque town on the mouth of the Columbia River not far from the Pacific Ocean. His mother and stepfather worked at a juvenile detention center and raised him with a strict hand. When he was no longer under their watch, unsupervised as a freshman at Oregon State, Poyer drank. And drank and drank.\nIt never seemed to affect his play in college, where he was a consensus All-American. And despite his continued drinking, he made steady progress in his early NFL years.\nGO DEEPER Graham: Bills rally around Sean McDermott in another win over Chiefs\nIn his third season, when he was an emerging starter with the Cleveland Browns, he DM\u2019d an Instagram model after she liked one of his posts on Twitter. She was a freshman at Florida Atlantic, a small-town girl from the Adirondacks who knew nothing about football but thought Poyer was cute. He traveled to Florida to meet her, and before the weekend was over, Poyer declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to marry this girl.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nPoyer made numerous trips to Florida that offseason. That spring as Rachel Bush was finishing her freshman year of college, she learned she was pregnant. After their daughter, Aliyah, was born, Poyer signed with the Bills, and the family moved to Buffalo. He and Rachel married in 2018.\nHis drinking was out of control by then. He would down a six-pack of IPAs in 20 to 30 minutes for a quick buzz. Blacking out was a regular occurrence. His behavior tested his marriage, but there was a draw between him and Rachel like a north pole to south.\nAfter the Bills lost to the Houston Texans in the wild-card round of the 2019 playoffs, Poyer was crestfallen. He says he drank heavily every day for five weeks. At one point Rachel rid their home of all alcohol, but he would still sneak what he could.\nRachel says her husband hid alcohol from her beneath bathroom cabinets and other places \u201clike a child.\u201d\nHe was close to losing her.\nThe drinking, he realized, was an attempt to relieve stress \u2014 stress from football expectations and stress from family life. He was a worrier, except with a drink in his hand.\nPoyer went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Then another, and another.\nThe get-together at Norman\u2019s house was his first significant temptation.\n\u201cWhen I put that drink down for the first time, it was almost like I overcame a demon,\u201d Poyer says.\nThe more time that passed, the less Poyer wanted to drink. He has no desire for it now, and the smell of alcohol almost makes him gag.\nDespite a stellar career and a loving family, Bills safety Jordan Poyer \u201cfelt like there was something missing\u201d as recently as last year. (Dan Pompei \/ The Athletic)\nBeing sober didn\u2019t make him immune to anxiety and depression, however. In the 2022 season, he missed five games with elbow, foot, knee and rib injuries. When the Bills lost to the Bengals in the divisional playoff round, Poyer felt responsible for not doing more.\nAnd his angst ran deeper than football.\n\u201cI still felt like there was something missing because I have this beautiful house, a beautiful family, everything anyone could ask for,\u201d he says. \u201cI still felt a sense of unhappiness, a sense of not understanding who I was, and why I was the way I was. A part of me felt guilty just because I was living this way.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nPoyer couldn\u2019t come to terms with why, despite all his shortcomings, he was in such an enviable position. His football journey was improbable. No major college wanted him until Oregon State came in with a late offer to grayshirt, meaning his scholarship wouldn\u2019t begin until January of his freshman year. He was chosen in the seventh round of the 2013 NFL draft, came into the league as a cornerback, was cut six games into his rookie season and then had to learn a new position with a new team. He took a blind-side hit that put him in the hospital for two days with a lacerated kidney and a concussion. His career could have been over then.\nYet by now he has outlasted 191 of the 217 players drafted ahead of him. And he hasn\u2019t just survived in the NFL \u2014 he has thrived.\nWhat had he done to deserve this?\nWas he justifying his good fortune?\nWould there be a greater purpose?\nIn 2018, Poyer saw a therapist for anxiety once a week. It was unfulfilling.\nThe answers were somewhere else.\nGO DEEPER NFL Week 14 takeaways: Bills playoff bound? How far can Joe Flacco take the Browns?\nIn the Quechua language, ayahuasca (pronounced \u2018eye-ah-WAH-ska\u2019) means \u201cvine of the soul.\u201d\nAyahuasca is a psychedelic drug made from the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub and the stalks of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine. It has been used for more than a thousand years by Amazonian tribes. Ingesting it can induce a dreamlike feeling, an altered state of consciousness, mystical experiences and euphoria.\nIn the summer of 2022, Aaron Rodgers revealed he had taken ayahuasca and credited it with helping him have two of the best seasons of his career for the Packers.\nPoyer had never heard of ayahuasca at the time. \u201cMy first thought was eff that,\u201d Poyer says. \u201cYou crazy? I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d\nThe funny word kept showing up in different conversations on his social media feeds and podcasts. Poyer researched it and became intrigued.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the difficult 2022 season, Rachel suggested Poyer take a \u201cguys trip\u201d after the season to check out. But \u201cguys trips\u201d usually involve alcohol, and he didn\u2019t want that. Sightseeing isn\u2019t his thing. \u201cWhat I really wanted to do was work on trying to be a better me,\u201d he says.\nHe discovered Resonance, a retreat center in Costa Rica on a hilltop overlooking the Pacific coast and the cloud forest of Monteverde.\nTo prepare his mind to enter a state of awareness, he was to eat only chicken, fish and salad for one month, with no oils and sugar added. Then he had to cut out chicken and fish for the week preceding the ceremony. He also was told to practice yoga and breathing exercises that would be useful if he experienced anxiety during the three ceremonies spread over a week.\nIn a tiki hut in a wooded, secluded area, a shaman presented each participant with a cup of ayahuasca brew, which is kind of like tea, but with benefits. Taste is not one of them. Poyer says ayahuasca tastes like earth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s brownish and really thick,\u201d he says. \u201cIt almost looks like oil, but it\u2019s darker and thicker. It\u2019s one of the worst things you could ever taste.\u201d\nFor the first hour after swigging it down, he lay in a bean bag chair in silence, setting intentions. Poyer\u2019s intentions were to understand himself better and love better. Eventually, the shaman provided a second cup, and then, enchantment.\n\u201cAt first what it felt like was my soul left my body for a good two minutes,\u201d Poyer says.\nInitially, it was unsettling.\n\u201cPeople try to control it, but you can\u2019t,\u201d Poyer says. \u201cIt took me about five or 10 minutes to figure it out. The ego has to die so the medicine can work. In order to let go and let the medicine do what it\u2019s supposed to do, we have to just breathe.\u201d\nFor about the next hour, Poyer says the highest version of himself lectured him out loud. It was, in his word, \u201ccrazy.\u201d First, highest-version Poyer addressed his desire to understand himself better.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe was basically saying, \u2018Jordan, look at your life, bro \u2014 what are you mad at?\u2019 \u201d Poyer says. \u201cIt was what I needed to hear because I wasn\u2019t appreciating anything \u2014 not my wife, my daughter, my family, my house. It was all about me and what I wanted.\u201d\nThen he turned to loving better. It was, he says, as if a Pandora\u2019s box opened on how to love.\nThe remainder of the ceremonies, which lasted nine hours each, were about curiosity, energy and connectedness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how to be a good human,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it grounds you. Really grounds you.\u201d\nJordan Poyer is the Bills\u2019 second-leading tackler but hasn\u2019t made as many big plays as he would like for a defense plagued by injuries. (Sarah Stier \/ Getty Images)\nTwo days before OTAs began last April, Poyer returned to the Bills\u2019 headquarters and stepped on the scale. The needle settled at 179 pounds, about 20 pounds below his playing weight.\nAfter resuming his regular routine, the weight came back quickly.\nHe discussed his experience with curious teammates, coaches and the team psychologist. Poyer hoped ayahuasca would elevate his football performances as Rodgers believes it did his, but it hasn\u2019t worked that way for him.\nHe is the second-leading tackler on his team but hasn\u2019t made as many big plays as he would like. What he has done, according to former Bills defensive coordinator Les Frazier, now an analyst for NFL Network, is enable his defense to be the best it can by lifting others through versatility, sacrifice, toughness and communication. Poyer wears his \u201cC\u201d well.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m playing OK this year,\u201d Poyer said during the Bills\u2019 bye week on the patio of his Florida home. \u201cI\u2019m not playing the best that I\u2019ve played in my career. There are probably two plays I really want back. But I\u2019m doing a lot. And in a very deep sense, I absolutely love that I\u2019m entrusted with doing as much as I\u2019m doing on this defense.\u201d\nAyahuasca gifted him in another way \u2014 with perspective.\nEgo is a powerful force in professional athletes. It helps them ascend and often hastens their downfalls. In previous seasons, Poyer believes his responses to successes and failures were too ego-driven. Football was him \u2014 he has an NFL logo tattooed on his left shoulder \u2014 and he was football.\nAdvertisement\nNot anymore.\n\u201cWe still have games left that I\u2019m excited about, but I knew some way, somehow, this universe was going to test me this year,\u201d he says. \u201cWe lost DaQuan Jones, Matt Milano and Tre\u2019Davious White for the season. It\u2019s hard. This s\u2014 is hard. And it\u2019s not just (the losses). I\u2019m 32, not this young spring chicken anymore. You know, s\u2014 hurts all the time. But my perspective is I get to play a game that I love, and I\u2019m healthy enough to play. Every time you come out of a game, that\u2019s a win in its own way.\u201d\nGO DEEPER Bills training camp preview: Is 2023 final run for Micah Hyde-Jordan Poyer tandem?\nPoyer\u2019s commitment is such that last season, when a rib injury precluded him from airplane travel, he took a 32-hour round-trip drive to play in a game in Kansas City. He wants to lift a Lombardi Trophy badly, as much as ever. But if it doesn\u2019t happen, he believes he can handle the disappointment better.\nOn Fridays this season, Poyer, fellow safety Taylor Rapp and assistant strength coach Will Greenberg play crystal bowls at Bills headquarters. \u201cThe different tones that you can tune into can enhance chakras within you and help you heal,\u201d he says.\nHealing takes many forms.\nWhen Poyer was 12, Louis Dunbar, who has done multiple stints in prison for violent crimes, called him for the first time and stunned him with the revelation he was his biological father. In subsequent conversations, Dunbar often said he wanted to see him or come to one of his games. He never has.\n\u201cI always had this hate and resentment toward him I was holding,\u201d says Poyer, who doesn\u2019t know where Dunbar is. \u201cThis experience enabled me to let that go. I realize I wouldn\u2019t have anything \u2014 my daughter and my wife \u2014 if not for him. Even if it was just the seed he gave my mom. So someday I\u2019ll meet him, give him a hug and tell him I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nRachel has no interest in taking ayahuasca. But she is grateful her husband discovered it.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAfter he did ayahuasca, he became like my dream husband,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cI was nervous about what it would do to him, but he came back a totally new man, so appreciative of me and our family.\u201d\nBills safety Jordan Poyer with his wife, Rachel, and their daughter, Aliyah. (Courtesy of Rachel Bush Poyer)\nHighest-version Poyer made Poyer aware he was not doing the little things \u2014 waking up with a smile, giving Rachel a hug on his way out, or being present even when his attention could be divided.\nPoyer has turned off his DMs on Instagram and deleted his Twitter\/X account. Instagram features a For You page \u2014 a personalized feed based on user engagement patterns. In the past, Poyer\u2019s was filled with posts of other girls, according to Rachel. Now there\u2019s nothing on Poyer\u2019s For You page except football and ayahuasca. She knows because they have one another\u2019s passwords.\n\u201cHis attention now is 100 percent on me, his family and his career,\u201d says Rachel, who has more than 4 million Instagram followers, an OnlyFans page and a line of skincare products.\nSome players feel more pressure when the end is closer than the beginning. The Bills have an out in Poyer\u2019s contract after this season. He isn\u2019t stressing about any of it. His focus is here and now.\nPoyer has thought about becoming a football commentator after retirement. But he has more to offer than sports talk. He could talk about why he\u2019s never had a vaccine, why Aliyah is homeschooled, or how he believes God transcends religions.\nHe could discuss why he has always thought he might be an alien. \u201cI truly feel like I\u2019m not from this planet, always being the odd one out, having different perspectives, thinking differently,\u201d says Poyer, who is fascinated by stars.\nPoyer has what philosophers call epistemic humility \u2014 he believes knowledge is limited and filtered by personal experiences. And now he is beginning to solve the mysteries of his existence.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cMy life has been changed forever,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd my purpose is to be a bright light for everybody that I touch and connect with.\u201d\nIn March, Poyer will return to Resonance for another retreat. Also planning to go are his cousin who went with him last year, and some first-timers \u2014 his mother, brother, a couple of friends and possibly a couple of teammates. He will be working on a documentary about ayahuasca.\nA handpan is a steel musical instrument that generates sound through vibrations. Sound healers and meditators often play the handpan. In Costa Rica, Poyer heard one for the first time and was drawn to it. Now he plays his frequently.\nNot long ago, Rachel returned home at about 10 p.m. and was tidying up the kitchen when, in the peace of the night, she heard something coming from the outside balcony upstairs \u2014 ethereal, haunting sounds.\n\u201cIt was kind of like something you would hear in a dream,\u201d Rachel says.\nIt was music the old Jordan Poyer never could have made.\n(Photo: Cooper Neill \/ Getty Images)\n\u201cThe Football 100,\u201d the definitive ranking of the NFL\u2019s best 100 players of all time, is on sale now.

However, since Thanksgiving Day is a federal holiday in the US, some stores will be completely shut down on the holiday.\nFor example, both Target and Walmart announced permanent closures on the holiday in 2020, with the policy remaining in place ever since. The outbreak of the pandemic had initially pushed these chains to close their doors on Thanksgiving, in order to limit crowding and spread out the shopping season.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that all grocery stores will remain closed on Thanksgiving Day. In fact, there are some retailers that you could make your way to on the morning of the holiday, in preparation for your annual feast.\nOnce Thanksgiving Day comes to a close, many stores will be reopening on Friday. From there, shops be operating during their earlier or usual business hours, in preparation for some of the biggest sales of the year.\nHere are when stores open and close on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday in the US.\nWhole Foods\nIf you\u2019re looking for some fresh produce to cook up a storm, then you\u2019re in luck, as Whole Foods is set to be open during the holiday season. However, they will run on a limited schedule, and hours of operation may vary, so be sure to check your local store. Whole Foods stores will be open on Black Friday, with hours of operation depending on location.\nCostco\nAll Costco stores in the US will be closed on Thanksgiving Day, as noted by the retailer\u2019s official site. Costco Warehouses will reopen on Friday, with hours depending on store locations. The retailer has already started some of its online sales for Black Friday, with some in-store sales going from 24 November through 27 November.\nWalmart\nThe retail giant will be closed on the holiday, before reopening the next day for Black Friday, an annual shopping occasion filled with store deals. Walmart\u2019s usual hours are from 6am to 11pm every day, but opening times on Black Friday are based on stores\u2019 locations.\nTarget\nThe beloved retail store will also be closed on Thanksgiving Day before reopening the next day for Black Friday. Hours of operation for the day after Thanksgiving vary based on the store\u2019s location.\nTrader Joe\u2019s\nStores will be closed on 23 November in observance of the federal holiday. Trader Joe\u2019s stores will reopen on Black Friday, with hours of operation depending on each store.\nWegmans\nWhile Wegamans will be open on Thanksgiving, hours of operation are limited. For example, one Wegmans store in Brooklyn, New York, will be closed at 4pm, instead of at 11pm like it usually does. Opening and closing times for Wegmans can vary based on the location of the store.\nAlthough most Wegmans stores are expected to reopen at 6am on Black Friday, specific opening and closing times vary for each location.\nStarbucks\nEarlier this month, a spokesperson for Starbucks told Country Living that stores will be open on Thanksgiving Day. While its usual hours of operation are from 6am to 9pm, stores\u2019 opening and closing times on the holiday vary based on location.\nAlthough Starbucks is expected to operate from 6am to 9pm on Black Friday, specific hours vary for each store.\nAldi\nAccording to Aldi\u2019s official website, all stores will be closed on Thanksgiving Day. Aldi will be reopening on Black Friday, as its hours of operation are usually from 8.30am to 9pm. However, specific opening and closing hours vary for each location.\nDollar General\nThe low-priced retailer will be open from 7am to 10pm on Thanksgiving Day but times may vary depending on location. You can find out more on the day by heading over to the store\u2019s website. Dollar General is expected to be open during its usual hours during Black Friday, with specific closing and opening times based on location.\nCVS\nA representative with CVS told ThePioneerWoman.com that most, but not all, CVS locations will be open on Thanksgiving. To check your local store, be sure to head over to the CVS\u2019 website. On Black Friday, CVS locations will be open during its regular hours.\nDunkin\u2019 Donuts\nThe beloved coffee chain will be open on Thanksgiving Day but with limited hours. Opening and closing times of stores on the holiday vary based on location.\nDunkin\u2019 Donuts with reopen on Black Friday, with its usual hour of operation based on each store.\nWalgreens\nMost Walgreens stores will be closed on 23 November this year, according to a press release shared by the brand on 16 November. While this is the first time that Walgreens has closed its doors on the holiday, some 24-hour stores will still be open during certain hours on Thanksgiving Day, depending on store location.\nWalgreens stores will reopen on 24 November, with opening and closing times depending on the location of the store.\n\nThis article, authored by Faiza Saqib and Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-11-06 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":323}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nAs Thanksgiving fast approaches, Americans are in the midst of writing their menus and buying the ingredients for their lavish feasts. And although it\u2019s a day filled with food and family, there is another popular tradition that\u2019s held around the holiday: Friendsgiving.\nEvery year, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of the month, with the holiday falling on 23 November this year. While it\u2019s often viewed as a day for Americans to express what they\u2019re grateful for, that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone will celebrate. More specifically, the event has been viewed as deeply controversial over the years, due to the contentious history of the first Thanksgiving celebration in the 17th century.\nThe holiday has been linked to instances of cultural appropriation, with some Americans believing that its history is frequently white-washed, prompting them to condemn or ignore Thanksgiving as a whole.\nHowever, the holiday itself has inspired another tradition of Friendsgiving \u2013 which can be held before, during, or even after the 23rd of November this year. The activity typically consists of a celebration with close pals since some Americans don\u2019t have the opportunity to return home for the holidays.\nOver the years, people have celebrated Friendsgiving in a similar vein as Thanksgiving, with everyone sitting around the table for one big feast. It\u2019s also often done in a potluck style, with each guest bringing their own dish to contribute. However, you don\u2019t need to have a big meal to celebrate your Friendsgiving, as there are many ways to change up your usual plans this year.\nHere\u2019s a list of activities that you could do for Friendsgiving that aren\u2019t the typical sit-down dinner.\nShopping at local holiday markets\n(Getty Images)\nWhile Christmas is still over a month away, many cities in the US already have their holiday-themed markets up and running. And since Friendsgiving isn\u2019t necessarily held on the Thanksgiving holiday, why not use it as an opportunity to check out some new shops?\nFor example, in New York City, Bank of America is currently hosting its annual Winter Village at Bryant Park in Manhattan. At the beloved New York City spot, there\u2019s a wide variety of food vendors, so you and your friends can take your pick at what you want for dinner and dessert. In addition, vendors are also selling a range of goodies \u2013 from ornaments to jewellery to scarves \u2013 which is the perfect chance to do some early holiday shopping.\nHosting a movie marathon\nInstead of hosting a big dinner, you could opt for another budget-friendly activity at your home: hosting a movie marathon. With the help of your friends, you can make a list of any horror, romance, or comedy movies that you want to watch for the day. You could also top off the activity off by supplying an assortment of snacks for your pals, or by cooking a meal all together.\nYour movie options can also match the theme of Thanksgiving, with films like A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019), Toy Story (1995), Addams Family Values (1993) and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving (1973). If you want, you could add some Christmas movies to the mix, including Elf (2003), It\u2019s A Wonderful Life (1947) and Steel Magnolias (1989).\nGoing hiking\nDepending on the weather outside, your plans for Friendsgiving could consist of going on a hike. Whether it\u2019s at your local park or a trail that\u2019s an hour or so away from you, hiking is the perfect daytime activity for you and your friend group \u2013 no matter how big or small.\nDecorating or baking sweets\n(Getty Images)\nDecorating or baking some sweet treats is another easy indoor activity. Whether you make a pie from scratch or simply frost your ready-bake sugar cookies, it\u2019s something interactive for you and your pals to do together.\nYou can also opt for treats that are on theme with the fall and winter seasons, from baking an apple crisp to decorating gingerbread cookies.\nRunning a Turkey trot\nWhether it\u2019s before, during, or after Thanksgiving Day, many cities in America host an annual Turkey Trot run. The length of the race can vary, with options ranging from a 5K to a half marathon, so you and your pals can take your pick at what you\u2019d prefer.\nFor example, in New York City this year, one Turkey Trot is being held at the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. During the race, which takes place on 25 November, participants will be running for the Rolling Thunder organsiation, which is a non-profit \u201cfor mainstream athletes who are developmentally disabled or have other special needs\u201d.\nAt-home wine tasting\nTypically, a night out at the bars with your friends can get a bit expensive, depending on which spots you go to. In a similar vein, a trip to a winery can rack up a hefty bill, and it\u2019s not the most enjoyable activity when it\u2019s cold outside. With that in mind, your Friendsgiving plans could consist of hhosting your own at-home wine tasting.\nFor the occasion, everyone can bring a different type of wine \u2013 from red to white \u2013 and give a few sips from each bottle a shot. If you\u2019re someone who\u2019s a big fan of wine, you could even end up discovering a brand that becomes your new favourite drink. When hosting the activity, you could make your own charcuterie board \u2013 filled with different meats and cheeses \u2013 to pair with wine.\nPlaying a football game\nIf your friends have a fun, competitive side, you can take part in another outdoor activity. You and your friend group can host the event in any big outdoor space you\u2019d like, whether it\u2019s a local park or your pal\u2019s backyard.\nIn addition, football meets the typical theme of Thanksgiving, as a beloved tradition on the actual holiday is to watch a sports game with the family.\nHosting an early holiday gift exchange\nWho\u2019s to say that you can\u2019t give your gifts to your friends a bit early this season? While the winter holidays are still weeks away, you could use your Friendsgiving to host your annual gift exchanges.\nFor example, many friend groups in the US have opted for the budget-friendly activity of Secret Santa, where each person is randomly assigned someone to give a gift to. During the exchange, you then reveal to your pal that you\u2019re their \u201csecret Santa,\u201d before giving them their present.\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-11-17 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":324}
{"title":"10 scorching-hot discoveries made about the sun in 2023","context":"## 10 scorching-hot discoveries made about the sun in 2023\n\nIn addition to being the largest and most powerful object in the solar system , the sun is also one of the most enigmatic entities in our cosmic neighborhood, which makes it hard for researchers to pin down exactly how it works. We are constantly learning new things about our home star, and 2023 has been no different. From learning more about the upcoming solar maximum to uncovering ancient superflares and mysterious heartbeat signals, here are the top 10 things we've learned about the sun this year.\nSolar maximum is right around the corner\nDuring the solar maximum (left), the sun is much more chaotic than during the solar minimum (right). (Image credit: NASA\/Solar Dynamics Observatory)\nThe major news about the sun from this year is that we are fast approaching the solar maximum and that it's going to be more explosive than we initially thought.\nBack when the current solar cycle began in 2019, forecasts from space weather scientists suggested that the solar maximum would arrive sometime from 2025 onward and be relatively weak compared to past solar cycles. However, numerous warning signs early in the year, including rising sunspot numbers , powerful X-class solar flares and changes in Earth's upper atmosphere , hinted that the solar cycle was not progressing as expected.\nIn June, Live Science published an exclusive, in-depth feature on the upcoming solar maximum, which revealed that the explosive peak would likely arrive by 2024 and be more active than the initial forecast suggested. And in October, space weather scientists released an updated forecast for the current solar cycle, which is more in line with what experts told Live Science.\nWhen solar maximum does arrive, we can expect to be bombarded with more solar storms, which will result in frequent auroral displays , radio blackouts, potential satellite problems and disruptions to the migration patterns of some animals .\nThe sun is smaller than we realized\nThe sun may not be quite as big as we thought. (Image credit: EVE, and HMI science NASA\/SDO and the AIA, teams)\nThe outer edge of the sun's atmosphere, or corona, does not extend out quite as far as we previously thought , a study published in November revealed.\nUntil recently, the best way to measure the sun's corona was to observe it during a solar eclipse when it becomes clearly visible around the moon. But new technologies have allowed scientists to measure the oscillations, or waves, that travel through the corona. These waves do not travel quite as far as expected.\nThe difference between the new findings and previous estimates is relatively small: The sun is likely somewhere between 0.03% and 0.07% smaller than we thought. However, scientists say this could make a big difference in how we study our star.\nThe sun has auroras too\nResearchers have found that the sun can produce aurora-like phenomenon above sunspots. (Image credit: Sijie Yu)\nWithin the solar system, auroras were previously thought to only occur on some planets and moons. But a study from November revealed that the sun also has auroras (although they are a little different from the ones we see on Earth).\nAstronomers detected radio bursts crackling above a sunspot after pointing a radio telescope at the dark patch. The frequencies of the radio waves were very similar to the wavelengths given off by auroras on Earth , which strongly suggests a similar process is occurring on the sun.\nOn Earth, auroras are born when solar storms and solar wind bash into our planet and temporarily weaken our magnetic shield, which allows radiation from the sun to excite gas molecules in the upper atmosphere. However, researchers think that solar auroras are created by electrons that are accelerated to incredibly high speeds along the sun's magnetic field lines instead.\nBiggest-ever solar storm unearthed\nA superpowered solar flare slammed into our planet 14,000 years ago, ancient tree rings show. (Image credit: Getty Images)\nIn October, researchers revealed that a superpowered solar storm, known as a Miyake Event, slammed into Earth around 14,000 years ago. And it could have been the most powerful solar outburst to ever hit Earth , experts said.\nResearchers found evidence of the cataclysmic event lurking within fossilized tree rings that were recently unearthed in the French Alps. The preserved plants all had off-the-chart levels of radiation in the same rings, which showed they all soaked up the radiation at the same time \u2014 and only a powerful Miyake Event could explain the levels of radiation the team found.\n\"A similar solar storm today would be catastrophic for our modern technological society,\" the researchers wrote.\nAncient 'superflares' may have sparked life on Earth\nAncient \"superflares\" could have sparked life on Earth, researchers claim. (Image credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center)\nContinuing the ancient solar storm trend, a May study revealed that \"superflares\" from the early hyperactive sun could have provided the energy needed to spark life on Earth billions of years ago.\nResearchers recreated Earth's early atmosphere in the lab and fired charged particles, like those found in solar wind, at the primitive gasses and found that this created both amino acids and carboxylic acids \u2014 building blocks for proteins and all organic life.\nSimilar experiments recreating lightning have also created these compounds in the lab. But the team argues that lightning strikes would not have provided anywhere near as much power as superflares, which makes them a less suitable candidate for kickstarting life on Earth.\nHowever, much more work is needed before any concrete conclusions can be made.\n'Ghost particles' could reveal hidden dark matter\nNeutrinos spat out by the sun could lead us to a hidden treasure trove of dark matter. (Image credit: Artistic rendering by Christopher Dessert, Nicholas L. Rodd, Benjamin R. Safdi, Zosia Rostomian (Berkeley Lab), based on data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope.)\nThe sun may be harboring hidden particles of dark matter in its fiery guts and neutrinos , or \"ghost particles\" that are spat out by the sun, could be the key to finding them , a pre-print paper published in August suggested.\nDark matter is an elusive type of matter whose identity is still a mystery to scientists. Dark matter rarely interacts with regular matter or light but when it does it is theorized to emit neutrinos, which have almost no mass and no electrical charge.\nResearchers hypothesized that the sun's core may have a high concentration of dark matter and, if this is the case, they predict that it will occasionally emit slightly more neutrinos than normal. However, these extra neutrinos have not been detected so far.\nAncient anomaly in sun's solar cycle\nAncient texts from Korea suggest the sun's solar cycle used to be much shorter. (Image credit: Yan et al. 2023)\nIt currently takes around 11 years for the sun to complete one solar cycle, during which it transitions from solar minimum to solar maximum and back again. But a pre-print paper published in June suggests that past cycles may have been much shorter.\nResearchers studied ancient texts unearthed in Korea, which contain detailed accounts of auroral displays during the Maunder Minimum \u2014 a period of reduced solar activity between 1645 and 1715. They found that solar cycles during this time likely lasted only eight years .\nHowever, scientists have not been able to properly explain why the solar cycle shortened during this period.\nMysterious 'heartbeat' puzzle solved\nScientists finally got to the bottom of what was causing mysterious heartbeat-like signals coming from solar flares. (Image credit: National Centre for Radio Astrophysics)\nFor more than a decade, scientists have pondered the origins of mysterious heartbeat-like patterns within streams of electromagnetic radiation that shoot out of the sun during solar flares.\nThe streams of radiation, known as solar radio bursts, normally flow non-stop out of the sun. But sometimes, there are fluctuations or gaps in the stream, known as quasi-periodic pulsations, which when viewed on a graph look similar to an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) of a human heart.\nEarlier this year, scientists studied some of these mysterious patterns produced during a 2017 solar flare. They found that the patterns were created by fluctuations within invisible fields of electrical current that run across loops of plasma on the solar surface.\nThe sun has shooting stars\nPreviously unknown blobs of plasma are raining down through the sun's corona. (Image credit: Patrick Antolin. Background image: ESA\/Solar Orbiter EUI\/HRI)\nIn July, scientists announced the discovery of a new feature in the sun's corona \u2014 shooting stars .\nThese \"stars\" are clumps of plasma that fall through the sun's upper atmosphere, like meteors falling to Earth, because they are cooler than the surrounding plasma and, therefore, denser.\nThese dense plasma balls can reach up to 435 miles (700 kilometers) across and seem to fall along magnetic field lines created on the sun's surface. Scientists dubbed this phenomenon coronal rain.\nMini solar wind 'jets' discovered\nSolar wind is constantly streaming out of the sun. (Image credit: NASA\/GSFC)\nIn August, scientists got a step closer to finally uncovering the origin of large outflows of solar particles, known as solar wind, that shoot out of the sun's corona.\nThe European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spotted tiny jets of plasma, known as picojets, shooting from tiny dark spots on the sun, known as coronal holes. The mini jets are smaller than other solar jets but still pack a punch, and researchers think that they provide the necessary energy to trigger gusts of solar wind .\n\nThis article was published by Live Science: The Most Interesting Articles on 2023-12-24 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":325}

{"title":"Watch great noir this Noirvember","context":"## Watch great noir this Noirvember\n\nYour time is precious, and your options are endless. The good news: We watch it all so you don\u2019t have to. Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\nFor some reason \u2014 blame the encroaching winter, post-Halloween boredom, or simple copycat syndrome, you be the judge \u2014 November has become a big month for annual social-media-based collective challenges. From NaNoWriMo and NaPoWriMo to Movember and No-Shave November to, um, others, the extremely online crowd has focused on November as a month for group events and group discussion.\nFor cinephiles, the fun one of the batch is Noirvember, a collective urge to watch and compare noir movies. Unlike most of these other challenges, Noirvember doesn\u2019t have an organizing website, a sponsor, a fundraising goal, or an established set of rules. (Though individual participants have certainly proposed some.) So for those participating \u2014 or for anyone looking for the best noir movies, or the best way to get into the classic genre for the first time \u2014 we\u2019re offering a little help. Here are some of our favorites, for newbies and noir veterans alike.\nThe classics\nLet\u2019s start with a few seminal noirs, the basics you\u2019ll want to hit to understand the genre and its conventions.\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941)\nDirector: John Huston\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple, YouTube\nProbably the most famous noir movie of all time, John Huston\u2019s adaptation of Dashiell Hammett\u2019s 1930 crime movie covers the basics: There\u2019s a hard-bitten detective, Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart), on a case full of twists, turns, and double-crosses; a beautiful woman who lures him in and turns out to be full of lies; and a McGuffin everyone\u2019s after that turns out to be more than it seems. A prime example of a noir that\u2019s more about atmosphere, cinematography, and a complicated plot than about edge-of-the-seat thrills, The Maltese Falcon is a moody movie with a lot of great performances, but it\u2019s also one of those films that\u2019s been imitated and iterated on so much that it can feel a bit basic in comparison to its followers. Still, that also makes it one of those movies where watching it suddenly makes a thousand later cultural references and media in-jokes make sense. \u2014Tasha Robinson\nSunset Boulevard (1950)\nDirector: Billy Wilder\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Paramount Plus, and free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\nStarting with one of the all-time great openings \u2014 has-been writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) wearily narrating over a shot of the police examining his floating corpse in a Los Angeles swimming pool \u2014 Sunset Boulevard is a stunner from start to finish. This one isn\u2019t a crime procedural, like so many classic noirs; it\u2019s about how Joe, out of work and fleeing the men trying to repossess his car, tries to find shelter with an aging movie star by promising to write her a comeback vehicle. He gets drawn into a drama he didn\u2019t expect \u2014 a drama that\u2019s exceptionally well acted and scripted. It\u2019s dark stuff about Hollywood dreams and how they die, with Gloria Swanson at her most captivating and frightening. \u2014TR\nDouble Indemnity (1944)\nDirector: Billy Wilder\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\nAnother Billy Wilder movie told in flashback, Double Indemnity is one of the great genre-defining femme fatale movies, with Barbara Stanwyck as the lovely lady leading hapless chump Fred MacMurray into an insurance fraud scheme that involves murdering her husband. It\u2019s one of the great twist movies \u2014 everybody in this film is a potential double-crosser, and MacMurray as an insurance investigator is both tasked with solving the murder he committed and trying to cover it up at the same time. There\u2019s enough going on here to keep anyone guessing up to the last minute. \u2014TR\nMore in this category: Le Samoura\u00ef, Rififi, Laura, The Third Man, Touch of Evil, The Big Sleep, In a Lonely Place, Chinatown, Night of the Hunter\nNext steps\nWhere to go after the basics? This is where noir fans\u2019 mileage is going to vary most, based on which aspects of noir they like most. The mysteries? The fraught relationships? The twisty stories and unexpected reveals? Just the overall mood? Here are a few we\u2019d recommend regardless of which subgenre you\u2019re most into.\nM (1931)\nDirector: Fritz Lang\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Max, The Criterion Channel, free with ads on Plex, and free with a library card on Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple\nOne of the most chilling crime dramas ever put to film, M has an unbeatable premise: When a child murderer starts haunting the streets of Berlin and the police can\u2019t find him, the local crime bosses join forces to bring him down. Something like a proto version of The Wire, jumping back and forth from the police perspective to the criminals\u2019 side of things and humanizing people on both sides, M is a procedural with several unusual turns, built around a particularly memorable Peter Lorre performance. It\u2019s also absolutely packed with breathtaking shots and exceptional use of light and dark, and the final manhunt sequence is a classic all-timer. \u2014TR\nNotorious (1946)\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi, IndieFlix, FlixFling\nAlfred Hitchcock\u2019s Rebecca is a defining noir classic, but fans who haven\u2019t dug past his topline roundup of classics shouldn\u2019t miss the memorable Notorious, a thriller-romance featuring some of his most touching character work. Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), the daughter of a German war criminal, is asked to use that connection to seduce and spy on a prominent Nazi figure (Claude Rains) for the American government.\nIn the thinking of the time, this involves ruining herself for good men like her handler and love interest (Cary Grant) by having sex with another man. In modern eyes, this looks like the stuff anime romance dramas and fanfic are made of: Deferring her own desires for her country, Alicia willingly enters a love triangle and invites plenty of tsundere. Will duty win over love? Will she get any good spying done? Is Cary Grant the biggest self-righteous stuffed shirt imaginable in this movie? Bring on the feels. \u2014TR\nMore in this category: Strangers on a Train, Ace in the Hole, Murder My Sweet, The Asphalt Jungle, The Killing, The Set-Up, Scarlet Street\nDigging deep\nFollow anyone on social media who\u2019s been at the Noirvember game for a while, and you\u2019ll see plenty in this category: titles that lack a Billy Wilder or Humphrey Bogart to bring them into the cinematic limelight, but that have plenty of their own memorable charms. Here are a few we recommend for noir fans who\u2019ve seen everything else.\nDetour (1945)\nDirector: Edgar G. Ulmer\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Prime Video, Criterion Channel, free with ads on Pluto TV or Plex, and free with a library card on Kanopy\nEdgar G. Ulmer was a prolific director in the Classic Hollywood era and directed the groundbreaking psychological thriller The Black Cat, the first movie to star horror legends Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff. It was a huge hit for Universal. But Ulmer was blacklisted from most Hollywood studios shortly after, when his affair with the wife of Universal studio head Carl Laemmle\u2019s nephew turned into a divorce and remarriage.\nThis is all necessary context for Detour, one of many micro-budget movies Ulmer made for Producers Releasing Corporation, the smallest of the Hollywood studios at the time. It\u2019s also a standout example of film noir aesthetics and low-budget moviemaking.\nDetour is about a down-on-his-luck young man hitchhiking from New York to Los Angeles to meet up with his love, who moved to Hollywood with the hopes of making it big. Along the way, he meets a mysterious stranger who upends everything.\nDetour\u2019s tiny budget gives the 66-minute film an odd aura, with sparse sets and back projection that is inconsistent at best. But the thing undoubtedly works \u2014 it\u2019s a haunting movie about the unluckiest man in the universe, and Ulmer\u2019s striking images (and an unforgettable performance by Ann Savage) through his evocative use of lighting paint a stark picture of an uncaring world. \u2014Pete Volk\nSudden Fear (1952)\nDirector: David Miller\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi, and free with a library card on Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple\nIf you\u2019ve never seen young Jack Palance and his startling cheekbones in a \u201950s movie, this crime-and-seduction drama is worth it for that alone. But the real star of the show is Joan Crawford, in a particularly fantastic performance as a successful, wealthy playwright who winds up on both ends of a revenge scheme. When Myra Hudson (Crawford) boots handsome leading actor Lester Blaine (Palance) off her latest play because she doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s convincing as a romantic lead, and then he \u201cjust happens\u201d to run into her, seduce her, and get her to fall for him, sharp viewers will think they know where this story is going. But that\u2019ll only get them one twist down the magnificently curvy road in this movie. It\u2019s another \u201ceveryone\u2019s a potential double-crosser\u201d story, directed with surprising style and a few winks at a noir-savvy audience. \u2014TR\nBorn to Kill (1947)\nDirector: Robert Wise\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu\nAn openly Hitchcockian drama that feels like a matchup for Suspicion, Born to Kill does some particularly terrific plotting around the idea that it\u2019s always exciting when the audience knows a lot more than the characters. Helen and Sam (Claire Trevor and Lawrence Tierney) are involved in different ways with the same double murder, but don\u2019t realize it. When they meet and are attracted to each other, viewers will see the threat looming ahead even when both characters are oblivious. More murder, blackmail, cover-ups, and a great deal of double-dealing follow, enough to require a scorecard to follow the action. It\u2019s a terrifically tense story where there\u2019s no mystery about who did the killing, just about what or who audiences should root for. Do these two crazy kids have a future together? Does either deserve a future at all? And how many innocent bystanders are they going to take down with them? \u2014TR\nLured (1947)\nDirector: Douglas Sirk\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy, and free with ads on Roku. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\nFor people only familiar with Lucille Ball as a comedian, this strange crime thriller is a particular blast. American in London Sandra Carpenter (Ball) is working as a taxi dancer when a friend of hers disappears, possibly the victim of a serial killer who\u2019s sending odd little poems to the police with every murder. The police ask Sandra to act as bait for the killer, which sends her on a bizarre, sometimes darkly hilarious tour of seedy London, as she answers lonely hearts ads and goes out to meet a series of strangers with the expectation that every one might be a murderer.\nBall is touchingly open-hearted in this movie, as a civilian who decides early on that she\u2019s a hard-bitten cop like so many other noir protagonists. But this isn\u2019t a satire or comedy \u2014 it\u2019s more in the mode of M than The Naked Gun, with the focus on the noose tightening around the killer, and the sense that anyone Sandra meets could be a harmless kook or a deadly predator. \u2014TR\nMurder by Contract (1958)\nDirector: Irving Lerner\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi\nMurder by Contract is a lean, mean noir that had a big influence on Martin Scorsese. The director has listed it as one of his guilty pleasure movies \u2014 calling it the film that influenced him the most, especially in Taxi Driver. \u201cThe film puts us all to shame with its economy of style,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMurder By Contract was a favorite of neighborhood guys who didn\u2019t know anything about movies. They just liked the film because they recognized something unique about it.\u201d\nIn Murder by Contract, Vince Edwards plays a methodical hitman who is asked to kill a witness in a high-profile case. When he finds out his target is a woman, he bucks \u2014 not on moral grounds, but because women are harder to kill, due to how \u201cunpredictable\u201d they are.\nIrving Lerner directs the movie masterfully on a minimal budget: It\u2019s a tight 81 minutes, aided by Edwards\u2019 fantastic performance in the leading role and a great all-guitar score from Perry Botkin. Catch up with a movie that inspired some of the greats, and learn more about film history in the process \u2014 all while having a great time. \u2014PV\nMore in this category: Force of Evil, Nocturne (1946), Female Jungle, Killer\u2019s Kiss, Abandoned (1949), No Man of Her Own, Nightmare Alley (1947)\nThe neo-noirs\nSearch for \u201cbest neo-noirs\u201d online, and you\u2019ll get a thousand movies with dubious-at-best noir connections \u2014 practically all it takes to get a movie labeled as neo-noir is a voice-over, a procedural plot with a lot of night shots, or a downbeat ending. But there are plenty of movies that update the genre squarely and fairly, with an eye toward all the core conventions and the flavor that made noir such a memorable genre in the first place. Here are some of the best and most high-fidelity neos.\nThe Last Seduction (1994)\nDirector: John Dahl\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Peacock or free with ads on Tubi, Vudu, Roku, FreeVee, and Plex. Rentable at Amazon, Vudu, Apple\nOne of the most gleefully cruel, shockingly dirty neo-noirs to ever claim the name, The Last Seduction is a series of surprises that feels all the more subversive because the femme fatale is the protagonist, and there is no hero worth the label. Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino) schemes with her patsy husband, Clay (Bill Pullman), to get her hands on a pile of illicit cash. Then she runs off with it and leaves him behind to take the fall. But she winds up stranded in a small town with time to kill and a second patsy to play with. This one gets particularly ugly by the end \u2014 it\u2019s a dark, dark story \u2014 but there\u2019s still a gleeful joy in the tightness of this narrative, and in Bridget\u2019s sociopathic skill at coming up with a manipulation for every situation. \u2014TR\nBlood Simple (1984)\nDirectors: Joel Coen and Ethan Coen\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Max and The Criterion Channel. Rentable at Amazon, Vudu, Alamo, YouTube\nFrances McDormand\u2019s screen debut and the Coen brothers\u2019 first movie is a must-see for neo-noir fans \u2014 the kind of tightly plotted, intensely acted, strikingly stylish movie they\u2019d continue to be known for in the decades that followed. It was a memorable debut for all concerned. A Texas woman (McDormand) cheats on her thuggish husband (Dan Hedaya), who sets out to kill her and her lover. But everyone involved seems to have a hidden agenda, and the threads get pretty tangled as they all come to the surface, with twist after twist making the action memorable. Blood Simple puts the visual darkness implied in \u201cnoir\u201d to particularly good work: It\u2019s the kind of movie where someone is always either lurking in deep shadow or forced off into a symbolic darkness that they might or might not come back from alive. \u2014TR\nBrick (2005)\nDirector: Rian Johnson\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Redbox\nFor fans: possibly the best ever neo-noir not made by the Coen brothers. For detractors: a weird \u201cIs this serious or satire?\u201d experience built around a mannered, oddball script that reduces noir to a literal high school teen drama. (Actually, the fans might agree with every part of that second description, and just mean it much more positively.)\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt stars as the hard-bitten PI equivalent, a high school kid devoted to a girl who jilted him, then turned up dead. Johnson\u2019s script (presaging his later, equally complex murder mysteries Knives Out and Glass Onion) treats high school drama like big-time drama, and puts Dashiell Hammett-style dialogue in the mouths of modern teenagers, for an effect that\u2019s a wee bit comedic and a whole lot of fun. This one\u2019s full of fun surprises, but it also respects the genre and plays fair by noir fans rather than subverting the classics. \u2014TR\nBad Times at the El Royale (2018)\nDirector: Drew Goddard\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on FreeVee. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\nA star-studded, charisma-packed murder-thriller told out of order, in the kind of layered \u201cand here\u2019s what was going on with this other character at the same time\u201d narrative that hangs plenty of Chekhovian guns on the wall for the final act, Bad Times at the El Royale is an underrated blast. Featuring Cynthia Erivo in a star-making role, Chris Hemsworth in a part that makes the most of his sex appeal, and plenty of other familiar names (Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson, Nick Offerman, Jeff Bridges) doing what they do, this one\u2019s a powder keg of a movie that assembles a motley crew of unrelated guests (or are they?) at a seedy motel, then keeps revealing secrets in a deliriously dizzy way as it all comes together. \u2014TR\nTwilight (1998)\nDirector: Robert Benton\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with a library card on Hoopla. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\nNo, not that Twilight. There isn\u2019t a sparkle-vampire in sight in this celebrity-crammed, steamy crime drama. But if you have a Noirvember buddy or viewing group, we recommend springing this on them at the last minute: \u201cHey, we\u2019re watching Twilight tonight!\u201d If they don\u2019t break your neck and throw you under a train, Double Indemnity-style, they\u2019ll probably thank you after watching this one, a surprisingly winning (and winningly surprising) crime drama starring Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, Reese Witherspoon, Stockard Channing, James Garner, Giancarlo Esposito, Liev Schreiber, Margo Martindale, M.

{"title":"Bryce Harper 'Atta Boy' controversy, explained: Why Orlando Arcia's comments led to backlash, Alanna Rizzo rant","context":"## Bryce Harper 'Atta Boy' controversy, explained: Why Orlando Arcia's comments led to backlash, Alanna Rizzo rant\n\nIt had been reported Monday night when the Braves beat the Phillies in Game 2 of the NLDS, ending on a critical base-running play involving Bryce Harper, that Atlanta shortstop Orlando Arcia taunted about the Phillies' star in the clubhouse after the game.\nThat report wound up generating plenty of controversy.\nFox Sports' Jake Mintz, one of the two brothers that runs the popular Cespedes Family BBQ account, reported that Arcia had been celebrating after Atlanta's 5-4 win by saying \"Atta boy Harper\" in the Braves' clubhouse, jeering at the fact that Harper was doubled off on the basepaths after an outstanding catch by Michael Harris in center field and an impressive relay to get Harper at first to end the game.\nThe comments wound up coming back to bite the Braves two days later, with Harper homering twice \u2014 staring down Arcia after each \u2014 as he powered the Phillies to the 10-2 Game 3 win. When the Phillies beat the Braves in Game 4 to eliminate Atlanta and advance to the NLCS, players in the Philadelphia clubhouse celebrated by repeating, \"Atta boy Harper.\"\nWhile the comments became a spark for the Phillies, it also became a subject of controversy. Players, including the Blue Jays' Kevin Gausman, decried the situation as a mistake by Mintz to report the comments, which were said out loud in the locker room rather than said in an interview setting. Others defended the situation, saying that anything in the clubhouse is open to be reported on.\nMORE: Why Arcia's comments motivated Harper after NLDS Game 2\nBut perhaps the biggest backlash came from MLB Network's Alanna Rizzo, who blasted Mintz on \"High Heat\" for reporting on the incident. Following a BBWAA statement, Rizzo both publicly and privately apologized to Mintz for her reaction.\nHere's what you need to know about the controversy.\nBryce Harper Atta Boy controversy, explained\nIt all begins with the play. In Game 2, Harper led off the top of the ninth in a one-run game with a walk. J.T. Realmuto flew out to center for the first out, but on the next play, Nick Castellanos lifted a deep fly into right-center. It appeared it would be extra bases, and if Harper took off, he'd be able to score the tying run on the play.\nThe problem for the Phillies was that Harris made a leaping grab up against the wall to rob Castellanos of the hit. Harper had well since rounded second on his way to third, but the throw from Harris missed both cut-off men by second. Austin Riley, however, ran in and scooped the ball and made an impressive throw to Matt Olson to nab Harper and end the game.\nAfter the game, Mintz wrote a well-reported story on how the Braves pulled off the improbable comeback, coming back from down four runs at one point, to win the game, and deep in the article, wrote the following:\nKevin Pillar's young son, sporting a custom \"Money Mike\" headband, waddled over to his favorite center fielder for a fist bump. Third-string catcher Chadwick Tromp strutted by Harris' locker offering a congratulatory \"Mike is him!\" All while Braves shortstop Orlando Arcia cackled emphatically about Harper's misfortune, bellowing \"ha-ha, atta-boy, Harper!\" repeatedly as reporters circled the room.\nAs Mintz pointed out, he was not the only one to allude to the celebration from Arcia. The Washington Post's Chelsea Janes also wrote about it, saying that one of Harris' teammates was yelling, \"Atta boy Harper.\" The only difference was that Janes did not name the player.\nThe reporting of Arcia's comments proved to be divisive across the baseball community. Among the most prominent to call out Mintz was Rizzo. The \"High Heat\" co-host said she was irritated by \"bloggers or podcasters\" going into the clubhouse and \"ruining it for the rest of us\" when \"some jackoff comes in at the end of the season that gets a credential, God only knows why.\" She called the clubhouse \"a sacred place\" and defended the players who were upset by the reporting of Arcia's comments, before she called Mintz out by name.\nMORE: Every time Nick Castellanos has interrupted a somber moment with a home run\n\"First of all, this guy, Jake Mintz, that's not even a reporter,\" Rizzo said. \"That's taking away from true reporters and true journalists. Where were you on the random Tuesday in April in Cincinnati when this team was playing in Cincinnati? Where were you on a rain delay, and you have to sit in the press box for all of this time? It's ridiculous.\"\n\"And then some jackoff comes in at the end of the season that gets a credential, God only knows why. And the clubhouse is a sacred space.\" Alanna Rizzo went off on Jake Mintz's clubhouse reporting on MLBN's \"High Heat\" Thursday. pic.twitter.com\/6dooqeLPnh \u2014 Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) October 12, 2023\nRizzo's comments immediately drew heat from the baseball journalism world, including from Janes, who posted a thread defending Mintz. Janes reported that cameras and recorders were recording, and that Arcia yelled the comments while they were recording and with more than a dozen reporters around. She said that reporters abstaining from writing on his comments would be akin to \"protecting players from themselves.\"\nShe also went on to say that what Arcia said wasn't a slur or hateful, and added the only reason anyone was concerned about it was because \"they know it would motivate Harper to beat [the Braves]. Which implies the Braves do not feel they can handle a motivated Bryce Harper and are willing to suggest that is why they lost the other day.\"\n\"I didn't say something sooner because I thought this was overblown,\" Janes continued. \"And frankly, I thought it wouldn't help. But I am genuinely disgusted by the way some media members are acting like a reporter was in the wrong for this. He wasn't.\n\"And if the Braves let this be the story of their series, that's on them. Win and it goes away. Period.\"\nThe incident elicited a response from the Baseball Writers Association of American (BBWAA), which defended Mintz, a BBWAA member.\n\"For the record, Jake is a BBWAA member in good standing and has earned the right to be credentialed through his hard work and quality baseball coverage,\" the BBWAA wrote in the statement. \"To assert otherwise, in vulgar terms, is both unprofessional and unacceptable. The BBWAA is deeply troubled that the league's own network would permit the disparaging of one of our members in this fashion. Scrutinizing our work is part of the territory but comments such as these should have no place on MLBN.\"\nFollowing the backlash to her comments, Rizzo apologized on \"High Heat\" to Mintz and the BBWAA. She said her comments were \"completely inappropriate, it was inaccurate and it was beyond unprofessional. I got caught up in the heat of the moment.\"\n\"What I said was completely off base and I've had an interesting 24 hours and I've learned a lot more and I apologize to Jake. I talked to him already, I apologized to him privately and I also apologize to him publicly,\" Rizzo said. \"They do a good job in the clubhouse and I was completely inaccurate in my assessment of what went down there.\"\nAlanna Rizzo gave \"a very heartfelt apology to Jake Mintz and the entire BBWAA\" pic.twitter.com\/rT9tjSWLY3 \u2014 Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) October 13, 2023\nMintz, though calling her initial comments \"incredibly hurtful\/uncalled for,\" wrote on X saying that he was \"glad she apologized,\" and asked people not to toss hate to her.\n\"Thanks to all the reporters, journos, baseball twitter weirdos, acquaintances and friends who had my back over the last 48 hours,\" Mintz wrote. \"And also, of course, the BBWAA. Community feels good, humbled to be a part of this one. Now, let's enjoy some ball.\"\n\nThis article, authored by Edward Sutelan, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-13 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":328}
{"title":"Castlevania: Nocturne is a revolutionary epic that does the franchise\u2019s best games justice","context":"## Castlevania: Nocturne is a revolutionary epic that does the franchise\u2019s best games justice\n\nPart of \/ The best entertainment of 2023\nNetflix\u2019s first Castlevania animated series excelled by balancing its quiet, beautifully performed moments of human drama with explosive and artful action set pieces dazzling enough to evoke the feeling of playing Konami\u2019s classic side-scroller for the first time. Despite the first show\u2019s strengths, its regular issues with pacing and effectively cultivating characters from season to season made the idea of Netflix keeping the vampiric daddy issues ball rolling with Castlevania: Nocturne \u2014 a new spinoff series from executive producer Clive Bradley and co-directors Sam Deats and Adam Deats \u2014 a dubious one.\nNocturne both looks and feels a lot like its predecessor in terms of its focus on a tortured scion waging war against machiavellian, bloodsucking ghouls who fancy themselves undead gods who walk among mortal livestock. But while Nocturne could have easily settled and coasted on classic Castlevania vibes, the new show steps its game up considerably by using the franchise\u2019s iconic lore to challenge your understanding of what it truly means to fight for freedom, equality, and fraternity.\nSet in the late 18th century during the thick of the French Revolution, Castlevania: Nocturne picks up hundreds of years after the events of Netflix\u2019s first Castlevania series as demon slayer Richter Belmont (Edward Bluemel) makes his way to France in search of vengeance and vampires. Like his distant holy whip-wielding ancestor Trevor, Richter\u2019s innate talents for magic make him perfectly suited for getting into the family business, and being raised by his formidable warrior mother Julia (Sophie Skelton) instills in him a profound sense of pride in the work they do.\nImage: Netflix\nTogether, Richter\u2019s raw potential and Julia\u2019s tutelage make him uniquely powerful even from a young age. But despite all of Julia\u2019s skill with her family\u2019s deadly heirloom, Castlevania: Nocturne\u2019s world is one teeming with vampires even centuries after Dracula has seemingly been destroyed, and the series opens at a devastating moment in Richter\u2019s past that leaves him orphaned and unable to access his magic.\nThough Nocturne takes place in the same continuity as the previous Castlevania show, it also uses major pieces of lore from Konami\u2019s Castlevania: Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night games to tell a riveting story about the inherent hypocrisies baked into the historic record of colonial nations embracing democratic revolution.\nHere, the French Revolution isn\u2019t just a transformative period of social unrest between moneyed elites and impoverished peasants fed up with their subjugation. It\u2019s a war between undead ghouls like Drolta Tzuentes (Elarica Johnson) manipulating mortals from the shadows, selfish humans like a power-hungry Abbot (\u200b\u200bRichard Dormer), and agitators like summoner Maria (Pixie) who want to dismantle the entire oppressive system of power that makes France a formidable global presence.\nImage: Netflix\nNarratively, Nocturne\u2019s focus on another brooding Belmont and its depiction of late-18th-century France as a country overrun by literally vampiric aristocrats drunk on the promise of a new messiah make the new series feel true to the essence of Castlevania. What makes Nocturne\u2019s deep dive into this alternate history a worthwhile watch, though, is the way it presents France not just as a crumbling monarchy in the throes of a heroic social uprising but also as a colonial nation whose pivot to democracy at home can\u2019t be divorced from its history of committing unfathomable atrocities abroad.\nNocturne reworks a number of Castlevania\u2019s classic supporting characters like Maria \u2014 who fights using reimagined versions of the Four Sacred Beasts \u2014 and empathic singer Edouard (Sydney James Harcourt) to brilliant effect. But out of all the show\u2019s old but new faces, ferrokinetic Vodoun practitioner Annette (Thuso Mbedu) stands out because of how strongly the show introduces her as a woman whose Haitian identity is what makes her able to understand the situation over in France with an exacting kind of clarity.\nIt\u2019s through Annette and the show\u2019s exploration of Afro Caribbean syncretism that Nocturne expands the boundaries of Castlevania\u2019s magical mythology, which is touched on heavily throughout the season\u2019s eight episodes. Small nods to the video games and gnarly beheadings abound, particularly in the Powerhouse Animation-produced show\u2019s bigger hyperkinetic brawls between its heroes and hordes of horrific creatures.\nBut in all the bloodshed, Nocturne still finds the time to make its characters (and by extension, you) think about what it means to slaughter technically innocent people for a genuinely noble cause. That beat isn\u2019t entirely original, and Nocturne\u2019s mindful about leaning on it too hard as it begins to weave Annette and Edouard\u2019s stories together with Richter and Maria\u2019s in France. Still, it creates a resonance between the show\u2019s action and the concepts it\u2019s tackling that makes the season as a whole work beautifully.\nImage: Netflix\nOccasionally, there are moments where the fluid dreaminess of Nocturne\u2019s overall art direction butts up against the show\u2019s application of 3D animation to make certain pivotal moments pop. It can be jarring when traditionally animated characters who were just popping in and out of view using tricks of the eye suddenly turn to the camera with deeper faces accented by flat shadows that weren\u2019t there a second before.\nAs strong and different as the season starts, by its last two episodes, Nocturne does start to feel a bit like it\u2019s rehashing moments from the first show \u2014 if not in exact form, then in terms of how neatly it brings its plotlines to a close. None of that\u2019s enough to keep the show from hitting all the right notes, however, and by the time you hit the finale, there\u2019s a solid chance you\u2019ll already be hoping for more.\n\nThis article, authored by Charles Pulliam-Moore, was published by The Verge on 2023-09-28 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":329}
{"title":"Ten Hag demands both positivity and pragmatism from erratic Onana","context":"## Ten Hag demands both positivity and pragmatism from erratic Onana\n\nErik ten Hag smiles when asked if Andr\u00e9 Onana can be the \u201cholding midfielder\u201d for Manchester United described in Uefa\u2019s technical report of the goalkeeper\u2019s display for Internazionale in May\u2019s Champions League final.\n\u201cFirst the job of a keeper is to save, is to [guard] his goal, that\u2019s his main job and don\u2019t forget this,\u201d says United\u2019s manager. \u201cBut, yeah, he is a keeper who we can use as an extra player and if we are developing [more] he can be more progressive and even higher up the pitch \u2013 an extra player, so that\u2019s an advantage.\u201d\nOnana\u2019s last game for the Italian club was the 1-0 defeat by Manchester City in Istanbul as United\u2019s crosstown rivals claimed a first Champions League and so clinched the treble. Yet if he has recent experience of facing Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, the 27-year-old will be a derby debutant against City in Sunday\u2019s 191st edition of the local squabble that will attract a global audience of millions.\nUefa\u2019s description of Onana intrigues because it suggests that what Guardiola introduced to the domestic game \u2013 a No 1 in Ederson who performs as a de facto extra defender to maintain fluidity along the backline \u2013 has evolved further. The goalkeeper was so advanced as to be a No 6 (rather than, the technical report posited, a \u201csweeper-keeper\u201d) who can take up residence in the middle third of his half as his team pushes deep into enemy territory.\nOnana did so against City for Internazionale but has this encounter with the champions come too soon for him to function as \u201cthe extra man\u201d Ten Hag identifies? \u201cIt also depends on the opposition, how strong is the press, for instance, and how good is the team around him,\u201d the United manager says.\n\u201cSo if it\u2019s possible \u2013 in my philosophy he has to do it every game [but] it is not always possible, so you have to adapt and this what I make clear. Even if you\u2019re not playing well, if the team is not playing well, or you\u2019re not playing to the standards you expect, you still have to win \u2013 so find a way to win, be pragmatic.\u201d\nUnited have been so of late, claiming victories over Sheffield United, Brentford and FC Copenhagen in their last three matches. But Ten Hag\u2019s \u201cdepends on the opposition\u201d and \u201chow good is the team around him\u201d comments sound like hints. In contrast to Inter\u2019s Simone Inzaghi, the United manager may harbour doubts about deploying Onana high up the pitch against City.\nThe Dutchman is still building his team and may be wary of the uneven form of United\u2019s new keeper. Bought for \u00a347.2m, Onana arrived on a ticket of being a high-grade shot-stopper, technically impressive too with the ball at his feet. But until impressing against Brentford and Copenhagen, Onana had bombed, costing United goals and points.\n\u201cCertain things [here] are different,\u201d shrugs Ten Hag when asked why the No 1 is taking time to settle in England. \u201cOK it is 11-v-11, and it is about attacking, defending, transition. But there is more: the approach to the game, the speed of the game, the intensity. The varieties in styles. So there is absolutely a difference and players need to adjust, need time to do so.\u201d\nLast season\u2019s derby at Old Trafford ended in a 2-1 win for United. Bruno Fernandes\u2019s equaliser was controversial with Marcus Rashford offside but not so the goal was chalked off as he had not touched the ball. So far this term the captain has scored two goals in 12 United appearances and Ten Hag has no doubt he can be a major factor in Sunday\u2019s showdown.\n\u201cIf he does [score] again, I\u2019ll be happy,\u201d the manager says. \u201cBruno is an [effective] player when we have a lot of the ball. Then he is at his best. And there are games against top teams when you have less of the ball. So then it is about taking benefit from [any attacking] moments and for the rest you have to work hard for the team. And to get a result because that is the most important, that the team is winning.\u201d\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

{"title":"DraftKings Picks Week 14: Best NFL DFS lineup advice for daily fantasy football tournaments","context":"## DraftKings Picks Week 14: Best NFL DFS lineup advice for daily fantasy football tournaments\n\nMost season-long fantasy leagues are entering their final week of the regular season in Week 14, and if your team isn't going to qualify for the postseason, then welcome to the DFS side of things, where every week is a new season and every DraftKings lineup can be the one that changes your life.\nIn this world, we don't have to sweat the injury reports, make difficult trades, or even concern ourselves with bad matchups. Instead, we get to enjoy each week for what it is -- a new opportunity. Whether it's your first time or your 200th time, there's something to keep us all coming back. Without further ado, welcome to our DraftKings lineup for Week 14.\nBefore we break down all of our picks, here are the most notable scoring rules for DraftKings contests: Full-point PPR, four-point passing TDs, three-point bonuses for 100 rushing yards, 100 receiving yards, and 300 passing yards.\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nDraftKings Picks Week 14: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments\nSunday main slate, $50,000 budget\nQB Justin Fields, Bears vs. Lions ($6,800). The Lions might have control over the NFC North, but their defense is losing steam as the season progresses. Detroit appeared well on their way to a dominant victory over New Orleans until they let the corpse of the 2023 Saints march back into it, nearly taking a lead (which is alarming with this version of Derek Carr leading the charge). Fields recently had success against the divisional foe, rushing for 104 yards and tossing a touchdown in Week 11. The dual-threat QB should be in line for a great day at home.\nRB Christian McCaffrey, 49ers vs. Seahawks ($9,200). Sometimes, you just have to splurge and live a little. Fantasy's best RB has been a little rich for us all season, but now is the time to strike. The 49ers are coming off an emotional win over the Eagles after stomping the Seahawks on Thanksgiving. They are trying to track down the top spot in the NFC and will continue to lean on their stars. McCaffrey just rushed over 100 yards and two touchdowns against this same defense two weeks ago, and his floor remains at the penthouse with a ceiling that stretches to the moon -- the place we hope to be going with him in the lineup.\nWEEK 14 DFS: FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nRB Alvin Kamara, Saints vs. Panthers ($8,200). The Saints have a QB problem and the offense is stuck in quicksand more often than not. Derek Carr will likely be out with a concussion, leaving Jameis Winston to start. The Winston experience is certainly not for the faint of heart, but it's undoubtedly exciting. Kamara remains a fixture in the offense as arguably the team's top runner and receiver, thanks to his work as a security blanket for whichever QB is under center. The Panthers remain terrible at defending RBs, giving Kamara the perfect landing spot to build on what was a solid Week 13. We can pencil him in for at least 100 total yards and a touchdown.\nWR DJ Moore, Bears vs. Lions ($6,500). Fields' chemistry with Moore is fairly obvious by now. The connection continues to shine with each passing week, totaling 210 yards over the past two games in addition to scoring a TD. We're especially fond of the 22 targets with a leaky secondary once again on tap. Moore cooked the Lions to the tune of almost 23 fantasy points in Week 12, and being well-rested off the bye means we're likely to see more of the same.\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWR Drake London, Falcons vs. Buccaneers ($4,600). When we see the Buccaneers on the schedule, we immediately look to see what WR1 is going to have a big day. It wasn't the greatest feeling in the world seeing the Falcons this week, but we're confident in London's ability to make this pick worth our while. He hauled in six-of-seven targets for 54 yards and almost added a score in Week 7 against Tampa, indicating history is on our side here. Because we splurged for McCaffrey and Kamara, we had to sacrifice salary elsewhere, and London is a high-upside option even in an offense that doesn't throw the ball with efficiency.\nWR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks @ 49ers ($4,100). Is a takeover underway in the Seahawks offense? Smith-Njigba is coming off a game against the Cowboys that saw him collect seven-of-11 targets for 62 yards. It's a step up from a disappointing outing against San Francisco, but Tyler Lockett's involvement seems to be lessening as of late with the rookie stepping up. It wasn't a great day for the Seattle offense on Thanksgiving against the Niners, but the Seahawks should put up a better effort against a divisional opponent they know so well. If they're trailing, JSN should see action with a negative game script.\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nTE Brevin Jordan, Texans @ Jets ($3,100). Jordan was a great streaming option and fill-in for the crowd that lost Dalton Schultz (hamstring) on Sunday, hauling in three-of-four targets for 64 yards against the Broncos. If Schultz is out again, Jordan is a serviceable option that has touchdown upside against a reeling Jets team that is busy booking vacations or plotting how to find themselves on a different roster in 2024. If Schultz does play, we'll pivot to the Jets' Tyler Conklin, who is $100 less and has plenty of opportunity in an even better matchup.\nFLEX WR Jameson Williams, Lions @ Bears ($3,500). As we come down to the last remaining dollars of our Week 14 budget, we need to take some swings and hope that the wind blows in our direction. What better way to approach this than with a pick from the game in the Windy City? Williams typically has around three chances a game to make a big play, something he's delivered on in two of the past three weeks -- including against the Bears two weeks ago. He's the perfect boom-or-bust target in a game that could feature a lot of points like it did last time.\nDEF Texans @ Jets ($4,000). We're right back to exploiting the Jets' offense since it's one of the few that we can trust to score fewer than 10 points every week. With Zach Wilson reportedly reluctant to play and further destroy a career hanging on by a thread, that leaves us with Tim Boyle, Trevor Siemian, or the lucky fan from Section 139 to lead the Jets to yet another embarrassing defeat. As the Texans try to make a playoff push, this one could get ugly.\nBest SuperDraft NFL DFS Picks for Week 14\nThis season, we're also listing our favorite Week 14 DFS lineup on SuperDraft, with some of our picks and analysis overlapping.\nFor those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as a few matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.\nWin BIG with SuperDraft! Join now and get a free deposit match of $20!\nHere are the most notable scoring rules for SuperDraft NFL contests: Half-point PPR, four-point passing TDs, two-point bonuses for 100 rushing yards, 100 receiving yards, and 300 passing yards.\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS: How to play SuperDraft\nQB: Justin Fields, Bears (Multiplier 1.2x)\nRB: Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (Multiplier 1x)\nRB: Joe Mixon, Bengals (Multiplier 1.3x)\nWR: DJ Moore, Bears (Multiplier 1.25x)\nWR: Michael Pittman Jr., Colts (Multiplier 1.2x)\nWR: Mike Evans, Buccaneers (Multiplier 1.1x)\nTE: Gerald Everett, Chargers (Multiplier 1.6x)\nFLEX: RB Alvin Kamara, Saints (Multiplier 1.1x)\nWe're combining forces between our FanDuel and DraftKings lineup to build this week's aptly named SuperDraft lineup that features our Fields-Moore stack and plenty of other players in great matchups who continue to produce at a high level each week.\n\nThis article, authored by Nick Brinkerhoff, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-07 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":331}
{"title":"OpenAI's ex-chairman accuses board of going rogue in firing Altman: 'Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did'","context":"## OpenAI's ex-chairman accuses board of going rogue in firing Altman: 'Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did'\n\nChatGPT-maker Open AI said Friday it has pushed out its co-founder and CEO Sam Altman after a review found he was \u201cnot consistently candid in his communications\u201d with the board of directors.\n\u201cThe board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,\u201d the artificial intelligence company said in a statement.\nIn the year since Altman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame, he has become Silicon Valley\u2019s sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of artificial intelligence and his sudden and mostly unexplained exit brought uncertainty to the industry\u2019s future.\nMira Murati, OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer, will take over as interim CEO effective immediately, the company said, while it searches for a permanent replacement.\nThe announcement also said another OpenAI co-founder and top executive, Greg Brockman, the board\u2019s chairman, would step down from that role but remain at the company, where he serves as president. But later on X, formerly Twitter, Brockman posted a message he sent to OpenAI employees in which he wrote, \u201cbased on today\u2019s news, i quit.\u201d\nIn another X post on Friday night, Brockman said Altman was asked to join a video meeting at noon Friday with the company\u2019s board members, minus Brockman, during which OpenAI co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever informed Altman he was being fired.\n\u201cSam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today,\u201d Brockman wrote, adding that he was informed of his removal from the board in a separate call with Sutskever a short time later.\nOpenAI declined to answer questions on what Altman\u2019s alleged lack of candor was about. The statement said his behavior was hindering the board\u2019s ability to exercise its responsibilities.\nAltman posted Friday on X: \u201ci loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement allowing OpenAI access to part of the AP\u2019s text archives.\nAltman helped start OpenAI as a nonprofit research laboratory in 2015. But it was ChatGPT\u2019s explosion into public consciousness that thrust Altman into the spotlight as a face of generative AI \u2014 technology that can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. On a world tour this year, he was mobbed by a crowd of adoring fans at an event in London.\nHe\u2019s sat with multiple heads of state to discuss AI\u2019s potential and perils. Just Thursday, he took part in a CEO summit at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco, where OpenAI is based.\nHe predicted AI will prove to be \u201cthe greatest leap forward of any of the big technological revolutions we\u2019ve had so far.\u201d He also acknowledged the need for guardrails, calling attention to the existential dangers future AI could pose.\nSome computer scientists have criticized that focus on far-off risks as distracting from the real-world limitations and harms of current AI products. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into whether OpenAI violated consumer protection laws by scraping public data and publishing false information through its chatbot.\nThe company said its board consists of OpenAI\u2019s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, and three non-employees: Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner of the Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\nOpenAI\u2019s key business partner, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into the startup and helped provide the computing power to run its AI systems, said that the transition won\u2019t affect its relationship.\n\u201cWe have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,\u201d said an emailed Microsoft statement.\nWhile not trained as an AI engineer, Altman, now 38, has been seen as a Silicon Valley wunderkind since his early 20s. He was recruited in 2014 to take lead of the startup incubator YCombinator.\n\u201cSam is one of the smartest people I know, and understands startups better than perhaps anyone I know, including myself,\u201d read YCombinator co-founder Paul Graham\u2019s 2014 announcement that Altman would become its president. Graham said at the time that Altman was \u201cone of those rare people who manage to be both fearsomely effective and yet fundamentally benevolent.\u201d\nOpenAI started out as a nonprofit when it launched with financial backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others. Its stated aims were to \u201cadvance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\u201d\nThat changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT large language model for mimicking human writing. Around the same time, Musk, who had co-chaired its board with Altman, resigned from the board in a move that OpenAI said would eliminate a \u201cpotential future conflict for Elon\u201d due to Tesla\u2019s work on building self-driving systems.\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s board has preserved its nonprofit governance structure, the startup it oversees has increasingly sought to capitalize on its technology by tailoring its popular chatbot to business customers.\nAt its first developer conference last week, Altman was the main speaker showcasing a vision for a future of AI agents that could help people with a variety of tasks. Days later, he announced the company would have to pause new subscriptions to its premium version of ChatGPT because it had exceeded capacity.\nAltman\u2019s exit \u201cis indeed shocking as he has been the face of\u201d generative AI technology, said Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran.\nHe said OpenAI still has a \u201cdeep bench of technical leaders\u201d but its next executives will have to steer it through the challenges of scaling the business and meeting the expectations of regulators and society.\nForrester analyst Rowan Curran speculated that Altman\u2019s departure, \u201cwhile sudden,\u201d did not likely reflect deeper business problems.\n\u201cThis seems to be a case of an executive transition that was about issues with the individual in question, and not with the underlying technology or business,\u201d Curran said.\nAltman has a number of possible next steps. Even while running OpenAI, he placed large bets on several other ambitious projects.\nAmong them are Helion Energy, for developing fusion reactors that could produce prodigious amounts of energy from the hydrogen in seawater, and Retro Biosciences, which aims to add 10 years to the human lifespan using biotechnology. Altman also co-founded Worldcoin, a biometric and cryptocurrency project that\u2019s been scanning people\u2019s eyeballs with the goal of creating a vast digital identity and financial network.\n___\nAssociated Press business writers Haleluya Hadero in New York, Kelvin Chan in London and Michael Liedtke and David Hamilton in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\nThis article, authored by Matt O'Brien, The Associated Press, was published by Fortune on 2023-11-18 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":332}
{"title":"WTF is going on at OpenAI? We have theories","context":"## WTF is going on at OpenAI? We have theories\n\nIn perhaps the most unexpected tech news of the year, billionaire and AI evangelist Sam Altman has been ejected from his CEO role at OpenAI by the company\u2019s board after an apparent vote of no confidence. Its exact wording in a release issued this afternoon: Altman\u2019s \u201cdeparture follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\u201d\nWhat the hell is happening at the most hyped company in the world?! Here are some totally speculative theories that occurred to us and others around the web.\n1. Did Altman circumvent the board in a major deal?\nBased on the board\u2019s language and the way these giant tech companies work, this is the prevailing theory floating around right now. \u201cNot consistently candid\u201d is a very diplomatic way of saying Altman lied.\nIt\u2019s possible that Altman \u2014 and potentially OpenAI President Greg Brockman, who stepped down as chairman simultaneously, then resigned \u2014 wanted to make a bold move that he knew the board would not like. It\u2019s not uncommon for these deals to be hammered out quietly in smoke- (or vape-) filled rooms and then presented as a fait accompli, but if it was controversial enough and the board found out about these maneuvers, it could be fuel for an ouster.\nBut what kind of deal would be big and dangerous enough for a summary dismissal of the CEO and famous face of the company? The man was onstage two weeks ago; I just talked with him! What could have happened since then?\nFew would be shocked if Microsoft, which is deeply, deeply embedded in OpenAI as an investor and customer, is a factor here. Could Altman have been working with \u2014 or against \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s patron in secret? If Altman wanted to kill the golden goose by going independent, that might have activated the board\u2019s fiduciary or otherwise statutory duty. On the other hand, if he was negotiating some other deal, like an acquisition or deeper and more exclusive integration, it could also have caused the board to bristle, either at the idea itself or at being excluded.\nBut if Microsoft was as shocked as the rest of us, as one report has it, it could hardly be the kind of high-stakes conspiracy some seem to be hoping for. But one must assume that Microsoft would say that either way. Even if they\u2019d been working with Altman on some kind of secret plan, they can truthfully say they were surprised by his firing. (And they \u201cremain committed to our partnership.\u201d)\n2. Do they disagree on long-term strategy?\nDespite being the hottest tech company in the world right now and everyone talking about ChatGPT, OpenAI isn\u2019t exactly a sound business. It\u2019s shoveling money into the furnace as fast as it can by serving, by all accounts, a fantastically expensive product at bargain-bin prices.\nThat\u2019s all well and good for a year or two, but at some point that strategy changes from a growth hack to an existential liability. Could Altman and the board have had irreconcilable differences on where that point lies?\nThis doesn\u2019t seem so likely. The company has been very deliberately pursuing this very publicly, confidently and on a long-term basis. Altman and the board seem to be in sync on this, at least for the present.\n3. Do the numbers not add up?\nOn the other hand, could OpenAI be losing even more money than Altman admitted or projected? It seems impossible, but the costs of running this operation have no precedent, nor really does the operation itself.\nOr what if, and again this is purely speculation, Altman has been secretly pursuing an internal project, perhaps at significant cost, against the advice of the board and without the necessary safety measures that probably should accompany such research? It sounds a little wild, but firing your CEO like this is also a little wild.\nSome kind of major mismatch in the financial department could be cause for dismissal, but it\u2019s hard to imagine what Altman could have kept from the board and CTO that would be so damning.\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that Altman was making personal investments in a way that the board disagreed with. With OpenAI poised to be a kingmaker in the field, he would certainly be in a position of power. One would think that, as an ideologically driven person already rich beyond belief and at the head of the world\u2019s leading AI company, Altman would have risen beyond having to do this kind of side deal, or at the very least that scrutiny on him and those close to him would prevent them. But one can never be sure.\n4. Could it be a major security or privacy incident?\nThe idea that the company has experienced a major, perhaps pervasive, security issue is bolstered by the fact that Microsoft reportedly suspended use of ChatGPT internally a few days ago. OpenAI subsequently stopped allowing new signups. If there was a serious security problem in its biggest product and Altman downplayed it, that would obviously create distrust with the board.\nThere is also the potential for misuse at scale with the enormous amount of personal data that travels through OpenAI\u2019s APIs and services.\nWorking against this theory is the fact that CTO Mira Murati was just elevated to interim CEO in Altman\u2019s place. It seems unlikely that anything security-related would go through the CEO and not the CTO, or that the two would be at odds to the point where one could be fired like this and the other swapped in to clean up the mess. As the board\u2019s statement notes, Murati is in charge of product and safety, among other things. Any significant snafu in that department would reflect on her, as well as Altman.\n5. Perhaps a difference of AI ethics or philosophy?\nAltman is a proud techno-optimist, and often speaks fondly of the possibilities of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a theoretical software system that achieves human-like intellect and versatility.\nThe board\u2019s statement pointedly includes that \u201cOpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity\u201d and that new leadership was necessary. It\u2019s possible that Sam\u2019s zeal for AGI, even absent a secret project or agreement, led to a major rift between him and the board.\nIt\u2019s been obvious to all that Altman took the company in a much more corporate direction from its origins, changing its legal status and aggressively pursuing enterprise and consumer applications. That doesn\u2019t sound a lot like the \u201cmission\u201d the board wants to advance. Then again, this shift didn\u2019t happen today, and it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like a plausible reason for abruptly firing the CEO and a few others on a beautiful fall Friday afternoon.\n6. What about IP and legal liability?\nAltman told me at OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day earlier this month that the company doesn\u2019t want to incur any copyright problems by using (as I had asked about) datasets of pirated books. But a lot of research I\u2019ve been reading contradicts that, as does pretty much every AI data scientist I talk to. It\u2019s exceedingly hard to imagine that OpenAI built GPT-3 with the copyrighted books database (as seems to be the case) but not GPT-4 or succeeding models. (I was going to write this up next week, so thanks OpenAI board for eating my lunch.)\nIf you were the board and facing the mounting accusations that your product was built on a dataset that includes thousands or millions of copyrighted works \u2014 and your CEO had systematically downplayed the potential liability there \u2014 how would you feel? I\u2019d feel very hurt.\nBut again, if copyright liability was the reason, it seems unlikely that the board would promote the CTO. Presumably, OpenAI\u2019s Chief Science Officer Ilya Sutskever would also have been in the know, and he\u2019s still on the board.\n7. Did CTO Mira Murati launch a coup?\nProbably not \u2014 she seems cool, and anyway what CTO wants to be CEO? Mira, answer my email!\n8. Was it a \u201cpersonal matter\u201d?\nWhen someone is kicked out in a hurry, it\u2019s not uncommon that there was some kind of unprofessional behavior in the workplace. Some CEOs get a pass on things like having kids with direct reports, but not all.\nAltman also has three siblings, and his younger sister Annie has publicly accused him of abuse. We have no way of evaluating these allegations, which involve private matters.\nOur read on the board\u2019s language in dismissing Altman, however, is that it was not a legal or personal problem that provoked the action, but a professional or business one.\nWe probably won\u2019t know the full truth on this for a long time, as the characters in the drama are likely to be NDA\u2019ed up. Per various whispers and leaks, an all-hands meeting about the situation this afternoon didn\u2019t produce any revelations beyond banal reassurances that the company is fine and they\u2019ll get a fresh CEO soon. Expect to hear a lot of rumors before we hear the real thing.\n\nThis article, authored by Devin Coldewey, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-18 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":333}
{"title":"Google fakes an AI demo, Grand Theft Auto VI goes viral and Spotify cuts jobs","context":"## Google fakes an AI demo, Grand Theft Auto VI goes viral and Spotify cuts jobs\n\nHey, folks, welcome to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch\u2019s regular newsletter that recaps the past few days in tech. AI stole the headlines once again, with tech giants from Google to X (formerly Twitter) heading off against OpenAI for chatbot supremacy. But plenty happened besides.\nIn this edition of WiR, we cover Google faking a demo of its new AI model (and giving out offensive notebooks to Black summit attendees), defense startup Anduril unveiling a fighter jet weapon, the continued fallout from the 23andMe hack, and the release of the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer. Also on the roster are stories about patient scans and health records spilling online, Meta\u2019s new AI-powered image generator, Spotify cutting jobs and an autonomous truck startup leaving the U.S.\nIt\u2019s a lot to get to, so we won\u2019t delay. But first, a reminder to sign up here to receive WiR in your inbox every Saturday if you haven\u2019t already done so.\nMost read\nAI, faked: Google unveiled a new flagship AI model this week called Gemini. But it didn\u2019t release the full model, Gemini Ultra \u2014 only a \u201clite\u201d version called Gemini Pro. In a press briefing and blog posts, Google touted Gemini\u2019s coding capabilities and multimodal prowess, claiming that the model can understand images, audio and videos just as well as text. But Gemini Pro \u2014 which is strictly text-in, text-out \u2014 has proven to be mistake-prone. And in a worse look for Google, the company was caught faking a Gemini demo by tuning text prompts with still images off camera.\nOffensive notebooks: In another Google PR blunder, people who attended the company\u2019s K&I Black Summit in August were given third-party notebooks containing highly insensitive language. My colleague Dominic-Madori writes that the inside of the notebooks were printed with the phrase \u201cI was just cotton the moment, but I came back to take your notes\u201d (emphasis ours). It goes without saying that this wouldn\u2019t have been well received by the mostly Black audience in attendance; Google has pledged to \u201cavoid similar situations as [it engages] with [merchandise] vendors going forward.\u201d\nAnduril\u2019s new weapon: Anduril, the controversial defense company co-founded by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, has developed a new product designed to take on the proliferation of low-cost, high-powered aerial threats. Dubbed Roadrunner, the modular, twin-jet-powered autonomous vertical take-off and landing air vehicle \u2014 one version of which is capable of carrying a warhead \u2014 can take off, follow and destroy targets or, if there\u2019s no need to intercept the target, autonomously maneuver back to base for refueling and reuse.\nMore 23andMe victims: Last Friday, genetic testing company 23andMe announced that hackers managed to access the personal data of 0.1% of customers, or about 14,000 individuals. But the company didn\u2019t initially say how many other users might\u2019ve been impacted by the breach, which 23andMe first disclosed in October. A lot, as it turns out \u2014 6.9 million people had their names, birth years, relationship labels, the percentage of DNA they share with relatives, ancestry reports and self-reported locations exposed.\nGrand Theft Auto goes viral: In just 22 hours, the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI racked up 85 million views \u2014 breaking a MrBeast video\u2019s record for most YouTube views in 24 hours. The excitement for Grand Theft Auto VI is a decade in the making; the previous entry in Rockstar Games\u2019 long-running franchise, Grand Theft Auto V, remains the second-best-selling video game of all time, falling short only of Minecraft.\nPatient records leak: Thousands of exposed servers are spilling the medical records and personal health information of millions of patients due to security weaknesses in a decades\u2019 old industry standard designed for storing and sharing medical images. This standard, known as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), is the internationally recognized format for medical imaging. But as discovered by Aplite, a Germany-based cybersecurity consultancy, security shortcomings in DICOM mean many medical facilities have unintentionally made private data accessible to the open web.\nMeta generates images: Not to be outdone by Google\u2019s Gemini launch, Meta rolled out a new, stand-alone generative AI experience on the web, Imagine with Meta AI, that allows users to create images by describing them in natural language. Similar to OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, Imagine with Meta AI, which is powered by Meta\u2019s existing Emu image-generation model, creates high-resolution images from text prompts.\nSpotify makes cuts: Spotify is eliminating about 1,500 jobs, or roughly 17% of its workforce, in its third round of layoffs this year as the music streaming giant looks to become \u201cboth productive and efficient.\u201d In a note to employees Monday, Spotify founder and chief executive Daniel Ek \u2014 citing slow economic growth and rising capital costs \u2014 said right-sizing the workforce is crucial for the company to face the \u201cchallenges ahead.\u201d\nTuSimple exits: When TuSimple went public in 2021, it was flying high as the leading self-driving trucks developer in the U.S. Now \u2014 after a string of internal controversies and the loss of a critical partnership with truck manufacturer Navistar \u2014 TuSimple is exiting the U.S. altogether. TuSimple said in a regulatory filing Monday that it\u2019s laying off the majority of its U.S. workforce and selling assets here as it exits the country for Asia.\nZestMoney shuts down: ZestMoney \u2014 a buy now, pay later startup whose ability to underwrite small-ticket loans to first-time internet customers attracted many high-profile investors, including Goldman Sachs \u2014 is shutting down following unsuccessful efforts to find a buyer. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup employed about 150 people at peak and raised more than $130 million over its eight-year journey.\nAudio\nTechCrunch\u2019s roster of podcast episodes keeps growing \u2014 just in time for weekend listening.\nEquity featured a throwback conversation from TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, when Alex sat down with Serhii Bohoslovskyi, the founder of a no-code app builder, Trible, that helps people construct online courses. The pair caught up on the state of the creator economy, the use of no-code tooling today (and how it\u2019s received by nontechnical creators) and the security of startups with roots in Ukraine.\nOver on Found, the crew talked to David Rogier, the CEO and founder of MasterClass, a streaming platform where you can learn from the world\u2019s experts on a range of topics. Before Rogier launched MasterClass, he worked as a VC, and \u2014 through his connections \u2014 he received a $500,000 seed round before he even had an idea for a company.\nAnd on Chain Reaction, Jacquelyn interviewed David Pakman, managing partner and head of venture investments at CoinFund. Before CoinFund, David spent 14 years at the venture capital firm Venrock. He also led the Series A and B rounds at Dollar Shave Club, which was acquired by Unilever for $1 billion. And, in 1991, David co-created Apple Music when he was part of Apple\u2019s system software product marketing group.\nTechCrunch+\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber.

{"title":"Meta says it\u2019s prioritizing livestreaming checks during Israel-Hamas war","context":"## Meta says it\u2019s prioritizing livestreaming checks during Israel-Hamas war\n\nFollowing a content moderation warning from European Union regulators earlier this week, Meta has published an overview of how its responding to risks on its social media platforms stemming from the Israel-Hamas war.\nIts blog post covers what it frames as \u201congoing efforts\u201d, with some existing policies and tools for users rehashed. But the company confirms it\u2019s made some changes in light of fast moving events in Israel and Gaza.\nThese include what it says is a temporary expansion of its Violence and Incitement policy in order to prioritize the safety of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas.\nUnder this change Meta says it will be removing content that \u201cclearly identifies hostages when we\u2019re made aware of it, even if it\u2019s being done to condemn or raise awareness of their situation\u201d. \u201cWe are allowing content with blurred images of the victims but, in line with standards established by the Geneva Convention, we will prioritize the safety and privacy of kidnapping victims if we are unsure or unable to make a clear assessment,\u201d it added.\nMeta also says it\u2019s prioritizing checks on livestreaming functions on Facebook and Instagram \u2014 including watching for any attempts by Hamas to use the tools to broadcast footage of captured Israelis or other hostages.\nIn a particularly disturbing report on Israeli media this week, which was widely recirculated on social media, a girl recounted how she and her family had learnt about the death of her grandmother after Hamas militants had uploaded a video of her dead body to Facebook, apparently using her own mobile phone to post the graphic content to the dead woman\u2019s Facebook page.\n\u201cWe recognize that the immediacy of Live brings unique challenges, so we have restrictions in place on the use of Live for people who have previously violated certain policies. We\u2019re prioritizing livestream reports related to this crisis, above and beyond our existing prioritization of Live videos,\u201d Meta wrote, highlighting measure it took in the wake of the 2019 Christchurch attacks in New Zealand when a single shooter livestreamed a killing spree that targeted two mosques on Facebook.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also aware of Hamas\u2019 threats to broadcast footage of the hostages and we\u2019re taking these threats extremely seriously. Our teams are monitoring this closely, and would swiftly remove any such content (and the accounts behind it), banking the content in our systems to prevent copies being re-shared,\u201d it added.\nOther steps taken by Meta to respond to the situation in Israel and Gaza include making it less likely that its systems will actively recommend potentially violating or borderline content and to reduce the visibility of potentially offensive comments; and applying hashtag blocking to render certain terms related to the conflict non-searchable on its platforms. Its blog post does not specify which hashtags Meta is blocking in relation to the Israel-Hamas war.\nMeta\u2019s blog post also says it established a special operations center staffed with experts, including Arabic and Hebrew speakers, to dial up its ability to quickly respond to content report.\nIt also says it\u2019s taking feedback from local partners (such as NGOs) on emerging risks \u2014 and claiming to be \u201cmoving quickly to address them\u201d.\n\u201cIn the three days following October 7, we removed or marked as disturbing more than 795,000 pieces of content for violating these policies in Hebrew and Arabic,\u201d it wrote. \u201cAs compared to the two months prior, in the three days following October 7, we have removed seven times as many pieces of content on a daily basis for violating our Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy in Hebrew and Arabic alone.\u201d\nIn light of the dialled up attention on and concern about the situation, Meta says it\u2019s possible non-violating content may be removed \u201cin error\u201d.\n\u201cTo mitigate this, for some violations we are temporarily removing content without strikes, meaning these content removals won\u2019t cause accounts to be disabled,\u201d it notes. \u201cWe also continue to provide tools for users to appeal our decisions if they think we made a mistake.\u201d\nCompliance with the bloc\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) kicked in for Meta in August as the owner of a so-called very large online platform (VLOP).\nThe Commission designated 19 VLOPs back in April \u2014 including Meta owned Facebook and Instagram.\nThe designation puts obligations on VLOPs to respond diligently to reports of illegal content, as well as clearly communicate their T&Cs to users and properly enforce their terms. But it also ranges more widely \u2014 requiring these larger platforms to take steps to identify and mitigate systemic risks such as disinformation.\nThe regulation also contains a \u201ccrisis response\u201d mechanism which the Commission may adopt on VLOPs in situations where use of their platforms could contribute to serious threats such as war. Although this aspect of the regulation won\u2019t start operating until early next year (Feburary 17) as it requires an advisory body, called the European Board for Digital Services, to be operational so it can recommend the Commission to adopt a crisis response mechanism (and the set up of the Board is waiting on Member States to establish national Digital Services Coordinators, aka the bodies that will oversee DSA compliance for non-VLOPs).\nPenalties for failing to comply with the pan-EU regulation can reach as high as 6% of global annual turnover \u2014 which, in Meta\u2019s case, could run to multiple billions.\nThe social media giant is not alone in being warned by the bloc over content concerns attached to the Israel-Hamas war: Elon Musk\u2019s X has been singled out for even greater attention here \u2014 with the bloc issuing both an \u201curgent\u201d warning earlier this week and following that with a formal request for information about its compliance approach.\nTikTok has also received a warning from the EU about DSA content risks related to the conflict.\nThis report was updated with details about the operational timeline for the DSA crisis response mechanism coming into operation\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-13 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":335}
{"title":"How Chinese firm linked to repression of Uyghurs aids Israeli surveillance in West Bank","context":"## How Chinese firm linked to repression of Uyghurs aids Israeli surveillance in West Bank\n\nIn the occupied Palestinian territories, there are cameras everywhere. In Silwan, in occupied East Jerusalem, residents say cameras were installed by Israeli police up and down their streets, peering into their homes. One resident named Sara said she and her family \u201ccould be detected as if the cameras were just in our house \u2026 we couldn\u2019t feel at home in our own house and had to be fully dressed all the time.\u201d\nSurveillance cameras now cover the Damascus Gate, the main entrance into the old city of Jerusalem and one of the only public areas for Palestinians to gather socially and hold demonstrations. It\u2019s at that gate that \u201cPalestinians are being watched and assessed at all times\u201d, according to an Amnesty International report, Automated Apartheid. These cameras have created a chilling effect on not just the ability to protest but also on the daily lives of Palestinians who live under occupation, according to Amnesty investigators. The organization had previously concluded that Israel has established a system of apartheid against Palestinians.\nAmong the vendors behind these surveillance cameras is a company that has been accused of aiding what the US has categorized as a genocide: Hikvision. Based in Hangzhou, China, the company is one of the world\u2019s largest makers of video surveillance equipment. Already infamous among international human rights groups, it has been blacklisted by the US and identified by the UK as a security threat for being complicit in China\u2019s repression of the Uyghur ethnic minority.\nThe presence of Hikvision cameras in the West Bank was first revealed in the May report by Amnesty, which documented facial-recognition and surveillance-camera technology that the human rights organization concluded is being used to reinforce Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank in an act of \u201cdigital repression\u201d. Amnesty surveyed two West Bank neighborhoods, East Jerusalem and Hebron, where Israeli settlers have set up homes in violation of international law, and found that facial-recognition systems \u201care providing the Israeli authorities with powerful new tools for curbing freedom of movement \u2026 adding further layers of technological sophistication to the system of apartheid that Israel is imposing on Palestinians\u201d.\nThe Amnesty report identified dozens of Hikvision devices in the old city in East Jerusalem, nearly 40 of which were found on security infrastructure and illegal settlements in the Silwan neigborhood. The devices were \u201coperated by Israeli police and by private settlers\u201d and were \u201cmounted to military infrastructures and residential areas in and around the old city of East Jerusalem, in particular Damascus Gate, the Armenian quarter, the Muslim quarter, and Silwan\u201d.\nThe report is newly relevant in the weeks after the 7 October Hamas attacks that the Israeli government said killed 1,400 people. Since then, settlers have escalated their violence against West Bank Palestinians and the Israeli army has conducted raids in West Bank cities and refugee camps.\nHikvision has marketed facial-recognition features that would, it claimed, automatically detect Uyghur people. It has also advertised features meant to discern any person\u2019s ethnicity, age and race based on an image of their face. The Guardian first reported that Hikvision enabled police clients to set up alarms for when cameras detect any type of protest activity such as \u201cgathering crowds to disrupt order in public places\u201d, \u201cunlawful assembly, procession, demonstration\u201d and threats to \u201cpetition\u201d.\nHikvision did not respond to Amnesty\u2019s report on the use of its products , nor did the company provide an on-the-record response in time for publication. But Hikvision previously told the Guardian that it \u201chas strictly followed all applicable laws and regulations in the UK and all countries where we operate to ensure complete compliance.\n\u201cHikvision has never knowingly or intentionally committed human rights abuses itself or acted in willful disregard and will never do so in the future,\u201d the company\u2019s statement reads.\nExperts on surveillance tools used in the repression of Uyghurs argued the company\u2019s history shows Hikvision has not followed through on previous commitments to preserve human rights.\n\u201cHikvision\u2019s critical role in surveilling and oppressing Muslims in Xinjiang and the company\u2019s failure to take accountability shows that the company is not serious about ethics or protecting human rights,\u201d said Conor Healy, the director of government research at surveillance research publication Internet Protocol Video Market (IPVM) in a statement to the Guardian.\nThe Hikvision headquarters in Hangzhou, in eastern China\u2019s Zhejiang province. Photograph: AFP\/Getty Images\nThe report identified specific products deployed in the West Bank that come enabled with human and vehicle recognition features out-of-the-box. Amnesty could not confirm definitively that facial recognition had been activated in all the products identified, but investigators said they were \u201cconcerned\u201d the cameras \u201care potentially being used together with facial recognition tools\u201d. Amnesty investigators said the cameras are at high risk of being connected to Mabat 2000, an Israeli police-run facial-recognition surveillance network that spans the entire city of East Jerusalem. The vast surveillance system \u201cenables Israeli authorities to identify protesters and keep Palestinians under constant observation, even as they go about their ordinary daily activities\u201d.\nUltimately, Palestinians \u201cdon\u2019t need to see\u201d that the cameras are employing facial recognition to \u201cknow that they are being watched at every turn\u201d, said Matthew Mahmoudi, an Amnesty International researcher on AI and human rights. Their fears are not unfounded. In 2021, the Washington Post revealed the existence of a vast database called Wolf Pack, which contained images of and all the information available on all 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\u201cThese technologies are deployed to restrict the freedom of movement of Palestinians,\u201d Mahmoudi said. \u201cIn particular, your ability to move, to access work, to access education, to access medical facilities is stifled based on the usage of AI-based surveillance like facial recognition.\u201d\nThe Palestinian health ministry has said that more than 170 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank in the past month. The intensity of the violence in the West Bank has forced the displacement of at least 11 Palestinian communities, whose residents have historically refused to leave despite the difficulties posed by both settlers and the Israeli Defence Forces.\n\u201cWe see how the technology ends up being used to deter Palestinians in places like Silwan in East Jerusalem from resisting and dissenting the expanding illegal settlements,\u201d Mahmoudi said.\nUnited Nations experts have warned that \u201cthe Palestinian people are at grave risk of genocide\u201d as the Israeli army has bombarded Gaza, killing more than 10,000 Palestinians over the past month, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\u201cEven their family life and the sort of very mundane everyday actions suddenly become acts of resistance in the face of this ubiquitous surveillance apparatus that underpins much of how apartheid is exacted on Palestinians,\u201d Mahmoudi added.\nIn addition to the daily impact on Palestinian life that the vast surveillance network in the West Bank has had, there have been longer-term ramifications. According to the report, Amnesty International\u2019s Digital Verification Corps analyzed and verified the authenticity of 15 videos that showed Palestinians being detained \u201cwhere surveillance technologies appeared to have been used for registration, identification or recording\u201d. In one instance, Israeli police posted a video showing how they were able to identify a protester they had been monitoring through closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. They then showed that police officers were able to pick the particular individual out of a crowd, according to Mahmoudi.\n\u201cIn protests in particular, regardless of you being in a crowd, you\u2019re subjected to potentially being picked out and identified and persecuted,\u201d he said. \u201cThese technologies are being used in profoundly problematic ways when it comes to human rights.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Johana Bhuiyan, was published by The Guardian on 2023-11-11 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":336}
{"title":"Uber\u2019s Q3 numbers include impressive profitability gains, slower-than-expected growth","context":"## Uber\u2019s Q3 numbers include impressive profitability gains, slower-than-expected growth\n\nUber reported third-quarter earnings on Tuesday that show a profitable ride-hail and delivery company that\u2019s chugging along in spite of slowing growth in some sectors.\nThe company reported revenue of $9.3 billion, an 11% increase year over year. Investors had expected Uber to report revenues of around $9.5 billion (FactSet, Refinitiv), meaning that despite the company\u2019s growth, it fell short of estimates. Turning to profitability, Uber reported net income of $221 million in the third quarter, or 10 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $1.2 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Again, the company fell short of expectations that it would generate 12 cents in per-share profit.\nLooking ahead, Uber anticipates gross bookings of $36.5 billion to $37.5 billion, up just 6% at the top-end from its Q3 result.\nAfter reporting, shares of Uber are up 1.6% in trading, after an up-and-down morning of shares exchange.\nAgainst a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, the former startup darling\u2019s results can be viewed as an indication that its business model has matured and is now in a stable, profitable and cash-generating position. On the other hand, under-performing demand results from a company as global as Uber could indicate that consumer spend is coming in lighter than anticipated.\nFor startups in the transport and on-demand sectors, Uber\u2019s earnings are a regular informational zeitgeist. So let\u2019s work to understand where Uber\u2019s revenue came from in the third quarter, and how each of its top-line sources converted \u2014 or not \u2014 to bottom-line results.\nWhere did the money come from?\nIn the third quarter, Uber saw total bookings rise from $29.1 billion to $35.3 billion, a gain of around 21%. In business segment terms, Uber generated $17.9 billion in ride-hailing bookings (+31% year over year), and $16.1 billion worth of delivery bookings (+18%). Those key business groups at the company generated $5.1 billion and $2.9 billion in revenue, respectively, during the September quarter.\nThere\u2019s nuance to the revenue figures that we need to consider as the rule-changes in question do affect startups that operate in related categories. On the ride-hailing front, Uber told its investors that its Q3 2023 revenue was \u201cnegatively impacted by business model changes in some countries that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue by $161 million.\u201d That was not the only legal change that led to Uber\u2019s results changing shape. Under its delivery business results, the company added that its revenue result was \u201cnegatively impacted by business model changes that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue by $360 million.\u201d\nThe combined impact of those two items was 8 percentage points of growth.\nThe profit perspective\nFrom bookings to revenues to profits: How did the main portions of Uber\u2019s business generate black ink?\nTurning to what Uber calls \u201csegment adjusted EBITDA,\u201d it\u2019s not hard to see how the company managed to rack up more income in its most recent quarter. Ride-hailing adjusted profit rose to $1.29 billion, up 43% from $898 million in the year-ago quarter, while delivery saw its own profitability skyrocket from $181 million in Q3 2022 to $413 million in its most recent fiscal period.\nUber did spend more during Q3 2023 when compared to its Q3 2022 result, but the 5% gain in \u201cCorporate G&A and Platform R&D\u201d costs to $595 million was far less than the gains we saw above. So, Uber\u2019s adjusted EBITDA rose from $516 million in aggregate to $1.09 billion in the third quarter of this year.\nOf course, adjusted EBITDA is to profit as hidden heels in men\u2019s shoes are to height, so we\u2019ll want some harder figures as well. In the third quarter, Uber generated $394 million in operating income and $219 million worth of net income. Mix in $966 million worth of positive operating cash flow, and Uber looks very healthy, given that all of the figures in this paragraph were improvements on its year-ago results.\nBut while food delivery and scooting humans about town were profitable for Uber in the quarter, the final major portion of its business had a more lackluster quarter.\nFreight falls\nOne area that continues to drag on Uber is its freight business.\nWhile Uber\u2019s ride-hailing and delivery business saw an uptick in gross bookings in the third quarter, Uber Freight experienced a 27% drop year-over-year. Revenue, as a result, had a similar fall.\nThe business unit reported revenue of $1.3 billion in the third quarter, a 27% drop from the same period last year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Uber Freight had a 1% gain in revenue.\nThe results don\u2019t get any better once we turn to net income. On an adjusted basis, Uber Freight lost $13 million in the third quarter compared to a $1 million profit in the same quarter last year.\nUber said the dismal year-over-year revenue results for its freight business was driven by lower revenue per load and volume. Both are consequences of the challenging freight market cycle.\nUber Freight isn\u2019t alone. Other more recent entrants to the freight and logistics industry such as Flexport and Convoy have struggled this year. In Convoy\u2019s case, the business was forced to shut down with its assets gobbled up by Flexport.\nUber Freight continues to plug along, despite these economic headwinds. The question is whether Uber believes in the long-term income potential of freight.\nSo what?\nWhen discussing Uber\u2019s results internally, our vibe was that it is a very profitable and healthy company today, albeit one that is not growing as fast as the market had hoped. The fact that Uber\u2019s share price is up as we write this indicates that investors are content thus far to excuse the small Q3 misses and keep their eyes more focused on its year-over-year improvements and forward guidance. More when we get Lyft\u2019s numbers.\n\nThis article, authored by Kirsten Korosec, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-07 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":337}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nWinter is coming, as the clocks go backwards one hour at 2am on Sunday 29 October.\nThis will give us an extra hour in bed as we prepare for the colder months when the sun sets earlier and days get significantly shorter.\nThe clocks won\u2019t go forward again until Sunday 31 March 2024.\nEven so, the debate as to whether we should continue to comply with Daylight Saving Time (DST) protocols continues to run rife.\nMany academics, scientists and campaigners have called for the abolition of the clock turning-tradition, citing improvements to mental and physical health, public safety and wellbeing.\nBut what are the advantages of such a decision? We speak to the experts to get the low-down on the issue.\nAnnual energy savings of \u00a3400\nProfessor Aoife Foley from Queen\u2019s University Belfast has calculated that household consumers could save more than \u00a3400 per year from their electricity bill depending on their tariff if the government scrapped DST at the end of October.\nDr Foley, who specialises in clean energy research, estimates that we could save \u00a31.20 a day and dramatically reduce demand on the National Grid.\n\u201cBy simply foregoing the winter DST in October, we save energy because it is brighter in the evening during winter, so we reduce commercial and residential electrical demand as people leave work earlier, and go home earlier, meaning less lighting and heating is needed,\u201d she said.\nMany people are concerned about spiking energy bills this winter (Getty\/iStock)\nDuring winter, evening energy demand peaks between 5pm and 7pm, with UK households potentially facing three-hour power cuts this winter, the National Grid has warned, due to a shortage of gas.\n\u201cWe are no longer in an energy crisis in Europe but an energy war and, dependent on weather conditions this winter, it is very likely we may need to start rationing energy very seriously to avoid bigger energy issues in December and January when gas reserves start to run low,\u201d adds Professor Foley.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that by foregoing the DST in winter we would save a lot of energy, reduce our bills and carbon emissions during this energy war, especially during a cost of living crisis.\u201d\nFewer road accidents\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) has called for the abolition of DST, arguing that turning the clocks back increases the risk of road accidents, due to more people driving during darker winter months.\nThe Society has urged the UK government to adopt British Summer Time on a permanent basis.\n\u201cRoSPA is in favour of this proposal, and is calling for the government to adopt British Summer Time (GMT+1) all year,\u201d the society states.\nDark, icy roads can be dangerous (Getty)\n\u201cThis would mean road users will no longer experience the sudden onset of darkness during their autumn commutes, potentially saving many lives.\u201d\nAnd they\u2019re not alone. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents also supports the call to abolish DST, citing figures from the RAC Foundation which state that road traffic collisions increase by 19 per cent in the fortnight after putting the clocks back one hour from British Summer Time, reducing by 11 per cent when we put the clocks forward.\nIncreased immunity\nGetting a good night\u2019s sleep during the winter months is essential in protecting us against the seasonal increase in colds and flu. Research shows that even a small reduction in sleep has been shown to impact your immune system, however.\nMaking the move from daylight saving time interferes with your natural circadian rhythm, the 24-hour biological cycle that is influenced by morning light and evening darkness, however.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understate the importance of a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d says Giulia Guerrini, lead pharmacist of digital pharmacy Medino. \u201cHaving too much or too little sleep can have adverse side effects, so you should aim to get between seven and eight hours of sleep as consistently as possible.\u201d\nNever underestimate the value of a good night\u2019s sleep (Getty)\n\u201cOne of the biggest disruptors to our sleep is when UK clocks go forward one hour at 1am on the last Sunday in March and go back one hour at 2am on the last Sunday in October, which is rapidly approaching on 30 October.\n\u201cOne of the most important aspects of a healthy sleep schedule is waking up around the same time each morning, so try to limit yourself to a one-hour window if you need to adjust when you get up in the morning and when you go to sleep at night. One hour sounds like an insignificant amount of time, but it can completely throw our circadian rhythm, or more simply known as internal clock, off balance,\u201d he says.\nDespite this, a spokesperson for Sleep School, a science-based sleep education and therapy service, told The Independent that it is \u201cimpartial\u201d on the extent to which the clocks changing impacts sleep, arguing that the important factor is the duration of time asleep and a consistent schedule.\nFewer depressive episodes\nA Danish study from 2017 of more than 185,000 people over 15 years found that the transition from summer time to standard time was associated with an 11 per cent rise in depressive episodes. Conversely, the switch from winter to summer time was found to have no effect.\nPeople frequently report an increase in SAD and depressive symptoms in winter (Getty\/iStock)\n\u201cThis study shows that the transition from summer time to standard time was associated with an increase in the incidence rate of unipolar depressive episodes,\u201d the study authors concluded. \u201cDistress associated with the sudden advancement of sunset, marking the coming of a long period of short days, may explain this finding.\u201d\nA drop in heart attacks\nNot everyone is convinced, however. Charlie Morley, author of Wake Up to Sleep, cites a 2014 study by the College of Cardiology, which reported a significant drop in heart attacks in the 24 hours immediately following turning back the clocks.\n\u201cFascinatingly, each year when the clocks go back for Daylight Saving and 1.6 billion people across 70 countries gain an extra hour in bed, there is a 21 per cent decrease in heart attacks the next day,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s also a big drop in suicides and car crashes worldwide. That all adds up to tens of thousands of fewer deaths around the world from just one extra hour of sleep.\u201d\nWhen did Daylight Saving Time begin?\nThe UK first introduced Daylight Saving Time in 1916 when the government introduced British Summer Time (BST) to encourage people to spend more time outdoors in daylight.\nThe change hasn\u2019t always proved popular, however, with the European parliament voting in favour of scrapping DST in 2019, a change that was due to take effect for the first time in 2021, but plans have been stalled.\nA 2019 YouGov poll found that the majority of Brits were marginally in favour of keeping DST, however, with 44 per cent electing to keep the current system, while 39 per cent voted in favour of ditching the change.\n\nThis article, authored by Joanna Whitehead, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-24 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":339}
{"title":"Wild fire HC Dean Evason, hire John Hynes as replacement","context":"## Wild fire HC Dean Evason, hire John Hynes as replacement\n\nThe Wild have relieved head coach Dean Evason and assistant coach Bob Woods of their duties effective immediately, the team said in a statement Monday evening. The Athletic\u2019s Michael Russo reports the Wild will be naming former Devils and Predators bench boss John Hynes as Evason\u2019s successor.\nWild GM Bill Guerin gave the following comment:\n\"Dean did an excellent job during his tenure with the Minnesota Wild, especially as Head Coach of our team. I am very thankful for his hard work and dedication to our organization. I would also like to thank Bob for his hard work during his time as an Assistant Coach with the Wild. I wish Dean, Bob and their families all the best in the future.\"\nEvason had been a member of the Wild organization since he was brought on as an assistant in 2018, while Woods joined the Wild bench one season prior. The 59-year-old Evason began his coaching career with the WHL\u2019s Calgary Hitmen as an assistant in 1998-99 after finishing out his playing career in Germany, working his way up the junior hockey ranks over the next handful of seasons. His first NHL job came courtesy of an assistant role with the Capitals immediately after the 2004-05 lockout, coaching Alex Ovechkin in his first seven NHL seasons.\nAfter departing Washington in 2012, Evason spent the next several seasons working in the Predators organization as the head coach of their AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. There, he helped guide more than a few future NHL stalwarts \u2014 namely Mattias Ekholm, Ryan Ellis, Filip Forsberg, Calle J\u00e4rnkrok, Viktor Arvidsson, and Kevin Fiala, among many others. After joining the Wild, he earned a promotion to head coach within two seasons when the Wild fired Bruce Boudreau late in the 2019-20 campaign.\nJust a couple of years later, Evason had coached the Wild to their best season in franchise history. The 2021-22 campaign saw the Wild break the 50-win mark for the first time since their inception in 2000, nearly sitting atop the Central Division with 113 points. That was in an extremely tough group with the 119-point Stanley Cup champion Avalanche and the 109-point Blues, whom the Wild bowed out to in the first round of the playoffs. The Wild remain without a playoff series victory since the 2015 postseason and have not advanced to a Conference Final since the 2002-03 season.\nSo with the Wild now far out of the playoff picture with a 5-10-4 record, sitting bottom five in the league in both goals for and against, a change was necessary and expected. Injuries and goaltending have certainly played a factor in their poor play \u2014 captain Jared Spurgeon missed the first 13 games of the season, and Filip Gustavsson\u2019s and Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury\u2019s combined .878 SV% is near the bottom of the league.\nThey\u2019ve likely been unlucky, too. The Wild have controlled a slim majority of scoring chances and a strong majority of high-danger chances during 5-on-5 play, a common theme for an organization that\u2019s usually one of the more defensively stout in the league. But the culture around the team is evidently turning sour quickly, Kirill Kaprizov is on pace for a career-low 26 goals and has a team-worst -10 rating, and most of their depth defensemen have been significant liabilities. This roster is not all that different from the one that\u2019s finished top-three in the Central Division for three straight seasons, and it\u2019s certainly one that still has playoff aspirations.\nMinnesota has not won since Nov. 7 against the Islanders and is winless in seven straight.\nWoods, who had worked on the Capitals\u2019 bench with Evason briefly as an assistant in the early 2010s, is now on the open market after more than six seasons with the Wild. It\u2019s unclear whether the Wild will opt to fill his vacancy.\nHynes, who was let go by the Predators after last season, is technically in the final season of his contract with Nashville. That means the Predators had to grant permission to their divisional rival to speak to their former head coach and that Hynes will be paid by both Minnesota and Nashville this season.\nNow behind the bench of his third NHL franchise, he faces an uphill climb to get Minnesota back in the playoff picture. Hynes will suit up behind an NHL bench for a ninth consecutive season, as he was fired by the Devils and hired by Nashville midway through the 2019-20 campaign.\nThe Wild will certainly get a boost in the standings once Fleury and Gustavsson improve their play between the pipes, a likely scenario given their stellar performance last season. However, they again have the misfortune of being in quite a competitive division. The Avalanche and Stars occupy first and second place as expected powerhouses, while the Blues, Predators and Coyotes all sit at or above the .500 mark and, especially in Nashville\u2019s case, have posted decent underlying numbers.\nHynes\u2019 main job is simply to restore confidence in his group. This roster has the ability to play better \u2014 especially Kaprizov, who, despite the okay point production, has looked like a complete non-factor on some nights.

It makes him look stupid, I believe,\u201d Paro told Sporting News.\n\u201cSomeone in his camp has obviously leaked something out and it shows that it's obviously gotten to him.\n\u201cBut a 45-second clip of 240 minutes - we\u2019ve sparred over 80 rounds - if that's your best thing, well, fair enough, so be it, if that helps you sleep at night, good on you.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing for me, I'll take the free exposure from the little bitchiness going on, but I\u2019ve just got my mind set on the job.\n\u201cI'll just let my actions speak for me. I think it's just stress you don't need to put on yourself and get involved in.\n\u201cBoxing is a very mentally stressful sport as it is. So when I'm not boxing and fighting, I like to kick back and stick to myself.\u201d\nParo, who, along with Stevenson, has sparred with the likes of Devin Haney and Rolly Romero over the course of several camps in Las Vegas, said he\u2019d still work with him again if required.\n\u201cWe've always had nothing but respect for him and his camp,\u201d he added.\n\u201cI don't get involved in the sh*t. I think it's a bit of schoolyard bullsh*t.\n\u201cI'm just going to get rounds in if we need him or if we fight another southpaw and that opportunity\u2019s there, of course, it\u2019d be a no brainer.\n\u201cHe's probably one of the best, if not the best, southpaw around.\n\u201cIf it's going to benefit me and my career, of course I'll get the work in.\u201d\nParo\u2019s is a career which has, unfortunately, stalled in 2023.\nAfter scoring a first-round knockout over Brock Jarvis last October, the Queenslander looked set for a big year.\nHe was lined up to face Robbie Davies Jnr in a headline slot in Liverpool in March before a routine CT scan picked up an unknown facial fracture, seeing the presiding commission rule him out.\nAfter that disappointment, the 27-year-old secured a long-awaited world title shot, against Regis Pregrais in New Orleans in June.\nThis time it was an Achilles tendon issue which forced him to withdraw, sidelining him for an extended period and temporarily seeing him relocate to his hometown of Mackay.\n\u201cAbsolutely heartbreaking. There's no other words for it,\u201d he said of the missed world title shot.\n\u201cI was so devastated. At one stage, it felt like everything was coming to an end.\n\u201cI've had a pretty smooth career until this year and two injuries, back-to-back, it definitely tested me mentally.\n\u201cI went through hell and back. I was lucky I was around the right people, I was supported by my loved ones up home.\n\u201cIt tested me, it's seen how much I really did love the sport and how dedicated I was to it.\n\u201cIt was just a full reset. It relit the fire in my belly.\n\u201cIt's just good to be back and I definitely want to leave all that in the past and keep steamrolling forward.\u201d\nNow back fit again, Paro faces Ohio\u2019s Montana Love in San Francisco on December 9 (Dec. 10 in Australia) on the undercard to the WBC super lightweight title bout between Haney and Prograis.\nWATCH: Paro vs. Love, live on DAZN\nAussie fans will recognise Love as the man who lost via disqualification when he threw Stevie Spark out of the ring in frustration last October.\nParo hopes to put a difficult run behind him and kick off a world title charge with an emphatic win on a big card.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just bring the fight to [Love], he likes a slow, controlled fight, a slow pace,\u201d Paro said of the challenge which awaits in his return.\n\u201cWe've seen with the [Spark] fight, a bit of pressure and he folds, so bring the fight to him.\n\u201cHe's obviously weak in the head a little bit and actions speak louder than words, you've seen that in his fight.\n\u201cSo we're going to bring the fight to him. Smart pressure, smart boxing.\n\u201cI honestly believe I'm better than him in every aspect, except wrestling.\u201d\nAfter previously being ranked number one in the division with the WBO, Paro is now 11th in line for a shot at the championship - a casualty of his inactivity.\n\u201cThe Prodigy\u201d is confident one good performance can put him right back at the front of the queue.\n\u201cI'm going to get my title shot,\u201d he said\n\u201cI've proved it time and time again that I belong at the top level and I intend to do that on December 9, too, and stamp my way into a world title into an opposite corner and win it when I get my shot.\n\u201c2024, I want a busy year. I want to fight three times next year.\n\u201cI've only had one round in two years. I missed the sport and it's lit a new fire in my belly.\u201d\nWATCH: Paro vs. Love, live on DAZN\n\nThis article, authored by Tom Naghten, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-30 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":341}

You have to have respect for the past and simply say \u2018thank you\u2019 out loud that these old pros existed, because without them the tennis circus would no longer exist.\n\u201cI did play a bit in the 80s, but there was [Stefan] Edberg, [Mats] Wilander.

He wanted to be Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal, when perhaps he should have remained himself all along,\u201d Tsonga said.\n\u201cI think today he is himself. And even if it is divisive, I think that\u2019s why it is appreciated by many people. Because now he\u2019s completely honest.\n\u201cHe wanted to get away from this warrior image that he has, because he is a Serb, who experienced difficult things in his childhood. So he\u2019s a warrior, he should have assumed it from the start. I think he would have been loved for that.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nDjokovic recently spoke about the relationship he has with Federer and Nadal.\n\u201cObviously we haven\u2019t gotten along very well during our careers off the field,\u201d he told 60 Minutes..\n\u201cWe\u2019re not friends because we\u2019re rivals and it\u2019s difficult to be close as opponents. Some things you share about your life or how you feel can be used against you.\n\u201cWe have shared the stage for many years and I think there has always been the utmost respect, at least on my part, towards them.

It\u2019s a wake-up call to say, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m doing unbelievably, but I can\u2019t relax for one second because some of the guys behind me are going to push me so much.

Sharapova and Serena were huge personalities, even in the marketing world. You can\u2019t compare today\u2019s girls with them. And I think that in this situation, the WTA isn\u2019t helping much either.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me that they promote it well. Women\u2019s tennis now seems sidelined.

I made it over .500 for the season picking NFL games against the spread. Let's celebrate.\nIt's been a heck of a climb, one that has taken a few weeks. But after going 8-6 last week, I am now at 80-78-6 for the season. Let's go. I went 10-4 straight up last week to improve that mark to 99-65 for the season.\nThis week we have all 32 teams playing, which means a tougher challenge than in recent weeks.\nEven so, I like the card. It is Thanksgiving Week, and I have a lot to be thankful for, but next week you will be thanking me.\nHere's to an 11-5 week ATS and 12-4 week straight up.\nThursday, 12:30 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\nThis is a big game in the division for both teams, a survival test for Green Bay and a big one for the Lions if they want to try and get home-field advantage in the conference. The Lions have had defensive issues as of late and Jordan Love has played well the past two weeks. That will keep the Packers in this game, but the Lions win it.\nPick: Lions 31, Packers 27 (Result: Packers 29, Lions 22)\nThursday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\nThe Commanders are coming off a dud last week against the Giants, while Dallas is flying high. The Cowboys are playing as well as any team in the league. Washington's offensive line is an issue, which will lead to the Cowboys having a field day with their defensive front. Dak Prescott plays well again. Cowboys roll.\nPick: Cowboys 32, Commanders 16 (Result: Cowboys 45-10)\nThursday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, fubo)\nThis is a huge division game for two teams that have had a good rivalry over the past decade. The Seahawks are coming off a bad loss to the Rams, while the 49ers are coming off two dominant victories. Geno Smith is banged up, so his health is key. The 49ers have the look of a Super team again. They show it here.\nPick: 49ers 28, Seahawks 19 (Result: 49ers 31-13)\nFriday, 3 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime Video)\nThis Friday game the day after Thanksgiving isn't what it was expected to be with the Jets being an offensive disaster. The Jets defense is coming off a bad showing against Buffalo, and will be challenged here by the Dolphins. Tim Boyle will start at quarterback for the Jets, but will it matter? Even so, I think the Jets keep it close with their defense.\nPick: Dolphins 21, Jets 16 (Result: Dolphins 34-13)\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\nThis is a big game in a division with one team with a .500 record, that being the Saints. Both teams are coming off a bye, but the Saints have some injury issues. The quarterback situation isn't great for the Falcons, which is why I think the Saints will win it behind their defense.\nPick: Saints 24, Falcons 20\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\nThe Bengals without Joe Burrow will be a different team. Jake Browning starts, but we have no real idea what he can do. The Steelers defense is good. We know that. The Steelers fired offensive coordinator Matt Canada this week to hopefully liven up the offense. Kenny Pickett needs to play better now. He will here as the Steelers take it.\nPick: Steelers 23, Bengals 21\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\nThis is for first place in the division, with the Texans owning the Jaguars in recent years, winning 10 of 11 and blowing them out earlier this year. But the Jaguars got back on track last week and Trevor Lawrence played well. That will continue here as the Jaguars take command of the division.\nPick: Jaguars 27, Texans 23\nIf you want a more analytical approach to your NFL picks, then I highly suggest that you check out the SportsLine Projection Model, which has been on fire this year. Check it out if you want to know which side to bet for every game in Week 12.\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\nThe Bucs are playing a second straight road game, while the Colts are coming off a bye. That's a big edge for the Colts. Even so, I think the Bucs have the better team and Baker Mayfield will play well in this one. Gardner Minshew will not. Bucs win it, although they are banged up some on defense.\nPick: Bucs 30, Colts 21\nNew England Patriots (-3) at New York Giants\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\nThese are two of the bottom teams in the league, both with quarterback issues. Tommy DeVito did play well for the Giants last week, but Bill Belichick has had great success against rookie quarterbacks. The Patriots quarterback situation isn't good either, but I think the Patriots will find a way to win this one.\nPick: Patriots 21, Giants 17\nSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\nThis is the dog game of the week, featuring two rookie passers who are struggling behind bad lines. Bryce Young and Will Levis have been brutalized at times. What's to think that will change here? The Titans defense is better, so they get the best of it in what should be an ugly game.\nPick: Titans 23, Panthers 12\nLos Angeles Rams at Arizona Cardinals (PK)\nSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\nThe Rams are coming off a comeback victory over the Seahawks, while the Cardinals lost a tough one to the Texans last week. Kyler Murray has played well in his two starts, which I think will continue here. The Cardinals will slow down Matt Stafford and gang to win it.\nPick: Cardinals 27, Rams 23\nSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)\nThis is suddenly a big game for both teams. The Broncos have won four straight, while the Browns are 7-3 and would be in the playoffs right now. This will be the first road start for Browns rookie quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson, which won't be easy. But the Cleveland defense is dominant. They will shut down the Denver offense in a low-scoring game to win it.\nPick: Browns 20, Broncos 12\nSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\nThe Chiefs are coming off a tough Monday night loss and now must travel on a short week. The Raiders have looked so much better the past three games, but this is a tough test against a wounded Super Bowl champ. The Chiefs get back on track here.\nPick: Chiefs 27, Raiders 17\nSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)\nThe Eagles are playing on a short week after a road victory over the Chiefs on Monday night. The Bills are coming off an impressive victory over the Jets. Josh Allen looked good in that game, and he will in this one. He keeps it close, but the Eagles find a way late.\nPick: Eagles 31, Bills 30\nSunday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, fubo)\nThe Chargers are having major issues right now and face one of the best teams in the league in this one. The Ravens offense will miss tight end Mark Andrews, but the Chargers defense is perfect for any team throwing the football. The Ravens will win it with a big game from Lamar Jackson.\nPick: Ravens 30, Chargers 23\nMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET (ABC\/ESPN, fubo)\nThese two are coming off tough losses, with the Bears blowing a huge lead late.

Reality TV star Rachel Lindsay, a longtime NFL fan, recently slammed the \u201cobnoxious\u201d coverage, highlighting the \u201cexhausting\u201d uptick in Swifties obsessing over football. But that\u2019s just one example of how fans are finding this fixation a little too disrespectful towards the sport.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nFrom the league\u2019s humble beginnings in 1920 to the $18 billion juggernaut that it is today, the ride has been rocky with more than just a few small bumps along the road. But with the ambitious target that NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, has set for 2027, is there a new strategy in the 104-year-old league\u2019s master plan to dominate the world sporting scene?\nWhy the \u2018Traylor\u2019 saga will be the key to Roger Goodell\u2019s $27 billion target?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nHow can you not love Taylor Swift? Most of the 12 Grammy Awardee\u2019s songs are about that warm fuzzy feeling and chemical reaction that we call love. And her songs have earned the support of 103.7992 million Swifties in the world. Yeah, we don\u2019t have a round figure for that. We have the exact figure up to four decimals. That\u2019s how much data we have on her. Football has 184 million fans. The league is able to generate a revenue of $18 billion from 184 million. If it adds 104 (after rounding 103.7992) million to that number, guess how much revenue it will generate? $28 billion. And just like that, their target will be met.\nUSA Today via Reuters NFL, American Football \u2013 Taylor Swift reacts while sitting next to Donna Kelce watching the Kansas City Chiefs vs Chicago Bears game during the first half at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, Kansas City, Missouri, USA | Image Credits: Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports\/Reuters\nAnd while analysts like Stephen A.

TMZ reported that #87\u2019s jersey sales skyrocketed 400% and his Instagram followers by 276%. Yahoo Finance reported a 53% rise in viewership among teen girls. Who would have thought in their wildest dreams that the NFL would manage to rope in this part of the population? The October 1 matchup between the Chiefs and the Jets drew 27 million viewers. And became the most-watched Sunday TV show since the last Super Bowl! And the last Super Bowl had an actual concert by Rihanna.\nRevealed: The Dark Side Of Pat McAfee & Why Rob Gronkowski Is In The Firing Line\nKaepernick, who? Deflategate, what? In the media frenzy surrounding the two lovebirds, other issues get thrown out of the window. How can fans forget that the NFL is also organizing games outside the American borders with a view to garnering international appeal? The NFL has scheduled 5 games abroad this season. It is also addressing the concussion controversies. It recently added both new concussion rules and a new $100 million initiative called \u201cPlay Smart, Play Safe,\u201d to make the sport safer for players. And all the effort is showing.\nAccording to Joe Pompliano, \u201cThe NFL will bring in $20 billion in revenue this year, more than the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1 combined.\u201d Coming to the strategy part, a curious mind would perhaps think can they take a leaf out of the NBA\u2019s playbook and reinvigorate its appeal as it aims to conquer international audiences?\nCan the NFL take a leaf out of the NBA\u2019s grisly past and glorious recovery?\nThe NFL is already the world\u2019s richest league. Calling it an incredible feat would be a gross understatement. Consider this: the English Premier League, which is broadcast in over 212 territories, has a revenue of just $6 billion, while football games are primarily viewed in America only. However, the NFL does not just want to stop at $18 billion. It wants to become a $27 billion league in 4 years. But it must address a few skeletons in its closet before reaching that goal.\nIf you were around in the 1970s (that would make you at least 50 years old today), you would know that the NBA did not have the mass appeal that it enjoys now. With average game attendance hovering around 8,000 a game, it was one of the darkest periods of the basketball league. Drug abuse, brawls on the hardwood court that sometimes spilled over onto coaches and players \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a pretty sight. As reported in the Washington Post, even though there are no reliable figures on cocaine use by players, \u201cestimates by people in the game range from 40 percent to 75 percent.\u201d Revisiting the NBA caricature back in time, the New York Knicks became the first all-Black team in 1979.

Stern came and instituted an anti-drug agreement and even banned All-Star player Michal Richardson for life for drug abuse.

{"title":"Their kids died after buying drugs on Snapchat. Now the parents are suing","context":"## Their kids died after buying drugs on Snapchat. Now the parents are suing\n\nHanh Badger was working from home the morning of 17 June 2021. She went to the kitchen to grab a second cup of coffee and noticed her daughter\u2019s bedroom door was still shut. Badger found Brooke, 17, pale and motionless in bed.\nSoon, the sheriff arrived and immediately administered Naloxone, a nasal spray that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose. But Badger, a pharmacist, was confused. Brooke was a talented student who couldn\u2019t wait to begin college that fall.\n\u201cShe had the whole world in her hands,\u201d Badger said through tears. \u201cThere was no way in my mind that [Brooke] had died of a drug overdose.\u201d\nIn the ensuing days, Badger\u2019s husband and son were able to gain access to Brooke\u2019s computer and, with it, her Snapchat account. They found screenshots of what looked like a menu of narcotics, and conversations with a drug dealer showing Brooke had purchased what she believed to be Roxicet, a prescription medication containing acetaminophen and oxycodone typically prescribed for pain relief. Instead, the substance was a counterfeit pill that held a lethal dose of fentanyl.\nAcross the US, young people are dying from fentanyl in record numbers, even as overall drug use is on the decline. Nationally, the number of opioid overdose deaths for people 24 and under nearly doubled from 2019-2021. And according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the number of overdoses attributed to synthetic opioids like fentanyl dwarfs that of any other substance.\nBrooke Badger, 17, died of an overdose at her California home. Photograph: Courtesy\nIn California, where Brooke lived, fentanyl-related overdose deaths among 15- to 19-year-olds surged by nearly 800% between 2018 and 2021, according to data from the California Overdose Surveillance Dashboard. Many are young victims poisoned by counterfeit pills that have been pressed to look like legitimate prescription drugs, but that are laced with fentanyl, an opioid that is deadly even in granular quantities. Typically, those teenagers acquired what they believed to be Percocet, Xanax or other pharmaceuticals online through social media.\nIn their grief, victims\u2019 parents are motivated to end this crisis to prevent another family\u2019s suffering while also giving meaning to their loss. Many have launched awareness campaigns, founded educational programs and advocated for legislative change. And now, some parents are taking to the civil courts, targeting the tech giants whose platforms facilitated their children\u2019s purchases of pills that killed them.\nIn April, the relatives of more than 65 victims, represented by the Social Media Victims Law Center, filed lawsuits against Snap, the parent company of Snapchat \u2013 an app known for its disappearing messages features, and the platform used by the vast majority of the suit\u2019s victims.\nThe suit claims Snapchat\u2019s features facilitate practices like drug sales by connecting dealers to young customers while promising safety from legal repercussions through anonymity. Chief among those designs is the promise that a message will disappear not only to fellow users, but also on the software\u2019s back end, says Matthew Bergman, the lead attorney on the case. It prevents law enforcement officials from seeing the activity of a dealer even after they have been identified.\nOther problematic features include notifying individuals when another person screenshots their post, the ability to geolocate fellow users and algorithms that suggest new connections based on demographics.\nIn response, Snapchat filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, citing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from being held responsible for the illegal actions of their users. A hearing for that motion has been scheduled for 18 October.\nBut Section 230 only offers immunity to companies that have acted responsibly and taken precautions to prevent illegal activity from taking place on their platforms, which Bergman says Snap hasn\u2019t done. \u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s largest open-air drug market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was clearly designed with the intention of allowing and encouraging nefarious activity with a lack of record.\u201d\nSnap did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request seeking comment prior to this story\u2019s release. After publication, a spokesperson said that Snap works to \u201cblock search results for drug-related terms\u201d and redirects at-risk users to resources on the dangers of fentanyl. \u201cWe have great empathy for families who have suffered unimaginable losses. At Snap, we are working hard to stop dealers from abusing our platform,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nPerla Mendoza, a parent in the suit, found that Snap did little to prevent illegal drug sales in the weeks and months after the death of her son, Daniel (Elijah) Figueroa, who bought fentanyl-laced pills from a dealer on Snapchat. Even after she created her own account and found her son\u2019s dealer posting images with hundreds of pills, Mendoza\u2019s reports to the help center went unanswered, and it took eight months for them to flag his account. \u201cIt was really disheartening,\u201d she said.\nFor Badger, removing a dealer\u2019s account alone is insufficient. \u201cThey\u2019ll just create another,\u201d she said, emphasizing the need for structural reforms that clearly warn young users of dealers\u2019 predatory practices, or that make it so that drugs can\u2019t be peddled to kids on the platform in the first place. \u201cSnapchat perpetuated this crisis,\u201d she said.\nAmy Neville, another parent in the suit, believes that Snapchat creates an aura of safety around an otherwise dangerous activity. She described her son Alexander, who died at 14 after taking a counterfeit Oxycontin tablet he procured through the app, as sensitive, impulsive and curious about many things \u2013 including drugs.\nBut he was also hesitant about putting himself in dangerous situations. And by using Snapchat, he was able to avoid an in-person meetup and have the pills delivered straight to his door. \u201cThe old way of scary back-alley type transactions \u2013 Alexander would have never done that,\u201d she said.\nNot every parent feels the same way.\nEd Ternan, whose 21-year-old son Charlie died in April 2020 after taking a counterfeit Percocet he bought on Snapchat, sees suing the platform as counterproductive. \u201cIt feels like looking backwards,\u201d he said.\nTernan, who did not join the suit, goes on to explain that losing his son \u2013 an energetic and fun-loving young man who was weeks away from graduating from UC Santa Cruz \u2013 has forced himself to come to terms with the factors that came together to cause Charlie\u2019s death. Ranging from the app and the dealer, to the friends Charlie bought drugs alongside, to himself as a father. \u201cWhat was my role as a parent?\u201d Ternan asked.\nA screenshot of pills being sold on Snapchat. Photograph: Courtesy\nThe conclusion he reached is one that looks beyond blame. With his wife, Ternan now works full time on initiatives to educate parents on the dangers of fentanyl. He has even worked with Snap to promote awareness campaigns and find ways to make the app safer. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very successful partnership,\u201d Ternan said.\nEven for Neville, who is a plaintiff, going through the process of filing a lawsuit has been re-traumatizing. It forces her to relive horrifying moments again and again. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is worse, getting out and talking about it, or not talking about it,\u201d she said.\nBut for her, as it does for many parents, suing Snap represents just one iron in the fire. While Mendoza works to spread awareness of the risks of fentanyl to Spanish-speaking families, Neville travels to schools to share Alexander\u2019s story and hosts monthly online meetings that empower young people to do peer-to-peer youth outreach.\nIn doing so, she has learned that many parents and young people alike don\u2019t know about the existence of counterfeit pills \u2013 something she desperately wishes she had been aware of when her son was still alive. The night he died, Alexander had told his parents that he had been taking Oxycontin he got online, and that he wanted help. Neville and her husband immediately called a rehab facility and made plans to take him there the following day, but didn\u2019t think to take the pills away.\n\u201cWe thought we were doing everything right,\u201d Neville said. \u201cA little bit of information would have gone a long way in our household.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Robin Buller in Oakland, California, was published by The Guardian on 2023-10-18 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":345}
{"title":"Pok\u00e9mon is no longer just a game \u2014 it\u2019s a lifestyle","context":"## Pok\u00e9mon is no longer just a game \u2014 it\u2019s a lifestyle\n\nA normal person in a rural town has dreams of becoming a master. As they come of age and spring approaches, it\u2019s time for them to begin their journey to chase that dream. After saying goodbye to their mother and hometown, adventure awaits. They open the front door and take their first steps into a world full of new experiences and things to uncover.\nThat\u2019s right: it\u2019s time to enter the workforce!\nThe Pok\u00e9mon that existed when Game Freak and series creator Satoshi Tajiri kick-started a phenomenon in 1996, and the one that premiered its first live-action TV series in Japan with Pack Your Pocket With Adventure (Pocket ni Bouken o Tsumekonde, or Pok\u00e9Tsume for short) last month, are almost unrecognizable. Which makes sense when you go from creating a game in a home office to a franchise more lucrative than the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Harry Potter, and Nintendo\u2019s own Mario combined.\nMore than 25 years since the original game\u2019s release, multiple generations of kids have become adults under the watchful eyes of Pikachu and friends, and the series has grown to encompass everything from anime and merchandise to card games and Hollywood blockbusters. Perhaps most surprisingly of all, with the growth in popularity of trading card games like Pok\u00e9mon in a postpandemic world and the record-breaking sales of the recent generation of titles despite quality concerns, it only seems to get more popular by the year.\nFor a franchise to retain relevance for as long as Pok\u00e9mon, it must evolve \u2014 and not just evolve but interweave its ideals into the fabric of daily life. Those early generations of kids need to pass on their love of Pok\u00e9mon like how Disney animated classics often serve as a formative childhood introduction to film.\nPerhaps nothing encapsulates Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s successful transformation from video game to a way of life quite like Pok\u00e9Tsume.\nPok\u00e9Tsume. Image: TV Tokyo\nBut what even is Pok\u00e9Tsume? Prior to the premiere of the series in Japan last month, there had only been one prior attempt at live-action storytelling within the world of Pok\u00e9mon: 2019\u2019s Detective Pikachu. Unlike Ryan Reynolds\u2019 wisecracking gumshoe Pikachu, Pok\u00e9Tsume was the first Japanese live-action foray into Pok\u00e9mon and doesn\u2019t even take place within the universe of the games.\nIn this series, we follow Madoka Akagi, portrayed by popular Japanese idol Nanase Nishino of Nogizaka46, a recent graduate moving out of her childhood home to live in the city and follow her dream of becoming a creator with an upstart company called ADventure. She played Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue (Red and Green in Japan) when she was a kid but has long since grown distant from the franchise.\nIllustration by Sarah Oh \/ The Verge Read next: Pok\u00e9mon Sleep helped me catch \u2019em all \u2014 all the z\u2019s, that is\nMuch of the opening episode of the series plays out as a nostalgic parallel between the trials of working life and the journey to become a Pok\u00e9mon Master. The childhood friend who works for another company is your rival. The product presentation to an investment CEO with the company\u2019s status on the line is a gym battle.\nShe rediscovers Pok\u00e9mon in a box of items sent from her mother and begins to replay this formative adventure; there are clips of the game or shots where we see the joy on the faces of both child and adult Madoka from the dim glow of the Game Boy screen. Pok\u00e9mon love even intertwines with the music scoring the series: a relaxing bar plays a slow jazz-infused rendition of the Pok\u00e9mon Center theme, just like how a synth rendition of Pallet Town marks the start of Madoka\u2019s journey.\nAs the show develops, the lessons from the game form the basis of a pseudo-episodic tale about Madoka\u2019s life at the company. The struggle to connect with a new client is paralleled by the way pok\u00e9mon won\u2019t listen to you until you\u2019ve proven your worth with gym badges. Learning and improving on the job is the experience that turns a flailing, floundering Magikarp into a job-leading Gyarados. And so on.\nThe show can come across a bit silly in places, and it struggles with communicating itself by making its Pok\u00e9mon overlay at times difficult to take seriously. But there\u2019s heart: there are plenty of touches that represent a series made with love, such as how characters have their own sprites integrated into the gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon Red.\nWith Pok\u00e9Tsume, Pok\u00e9mon isn\u2019t just a virtual journey to become a champion. It\u2019s a lesson we take with us into our daily lives long after our adventure is at an end. It\u2019s an integration of the morals of the franchise into our daily lives that epitomizes a 15-year transformation of the Pok\u00e9mon brand.\nThe 2021 remake of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl. Image: Nintendo\nTo understand this, we must first cast an eye back to 2006. During the preparation for the launch of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl for the Nintendo DS, developer Game Freak found the series at a crossroads. Sales had been on a steady decline since the original release, with the Hoenn GBA games at the time holding the distinction as the worst-selling mainline titles in the series. The reality was that the original generation of players had graduated from playing Pok\u00e9mon, and new generations simply weren\u2019t interested. Something had to change.\nIn response, the company launched the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon Garden via the country\u2019s online Yahoo! Kids portal, an interactive experience taking you on a live tour through the history of Pok\u00e9mon, featuring mini-games and new information on the yet to be released Diamond and Pearl. Over 5 million unique users accessed Yahoo! Kids every month at this time, all within the series\u2019 core target demographic. In the end, the project proved successful, with Diamond and Pearl selling one-third more copies than its predecessors Ruby and Sapphire before eventually eclipsing the lifetime sales of those titles.\nNotably, at the time, it was one of the company\u2019s biggest attempts at diversifying the brand since its initial launch. Following the initial multimedia blitz, and the introduction of a World Championships and competitive circuit for the video games and TCG, the series remained relatively static. At this point, Pok\u00e9mon was yet to truly experiment with online distribution and promotion, nor had attempts been made to branch out beyond the series\u2019 core audience and multimedia properties following the initial surge in popularity.\nAs such, Pok\u00e9mon Garden was the first real attempt at expanding the core experience of Pok\u00e9mon to other platforms and audiences. While it\u2019s easy to mark 2016\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Go as the key turning point for Pok\u00e9mon in its appeal to older demographics \u2014 and it certainly was significant \u2014 the framework for this success was paved far earlier by experiments in diversifying what Pok\u00e9mon could be, whether that be through experiences like Garden or the transformation of the anime to tell a greater array of stories within this ever-expanding universe.\nFor the first time, external partners were being brought in to expand the world of Pok\u00e9mon beyond Ash Ketchum. OLM, long-term Pok\u00e9mon animation studio since 1998, passed the baton to other studios with the production of a spinoff series: Pok\u00e9mon Origins. While the studio did assist in production and animated the finale for the four-episode series, the rest of production was a collaborative effort led by Production I.G and Xebec, and proved to be a hit with audiences craving something new from the world of Pok\u00e9mon.\nPok\u00e9mon Concierge. Image: Netflix\nThis was just the beginning. Since then, no fewer than six unique web series have been produced by various external partners from around the world, each set in different regions within the world of Pok\u00e9mon. The most recent of these, this summer\u2019s Path to the Peak, was unique for taking place in the real world with a focus on the experience of competing in the TCG. Meanwhile, the upcoming Netflix series Pok\u00e9mon Concierge is another unique addition to this ever-expanding animation portfolio, marking the franchise\u2019s series debut in stop motion.\nThis is on top of a slew of one-off short films and music videos as well as a refocus of priorities for the long-running movie franchise. In 2017, the annual film franchise abandoned continuity with the TV anime in order to tell its own original stories without being confined by external events, allowing them to experiment with CG animation, remake the early episodes of the Pok\u00e9mon TV series in movie form, and allow Wit Studio, animators on the original series Attack on Titan, to helm their own movie with 2018\u2019s The Power of Us.\nThe company did more than simply introduce dynamism into an anime that had long since gone stale in the eyes of many. Greater efforts were made to integrate Pok\u00e9mon into the lives of communities in Japan and further afield, both through relief efforts and merchandising campaigns that provided more than toys and light relief to an aging audience.\nFollowing the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku and Fukushima, The Pok\u00e9mon Company joined many others in rushing to the aid of those affected. These efforts led to the establishment of the Pok\u00e9mon With You Foundation, aiming to provide support for disadvantaged communities even beyond this initial tragedy, expanding to everything from providing free educational materials and food drives for struggling children to funding scholarships. This was soon followed by partnerships with local governments across Japan for tourism initiatives, seen everywhere from Yokohama\u2019s yearly Pikachu Outbreak to the Pok\u00e9mon Local Acts initiative, which loans pok\u00e9mon out to flog local delicacies and hotspots, while serving as the origin of the country\u2019s charming Pok\u00e9mon-themed manhole covers.\nPikachu appears on a manhole cover in Yokohama. Photo by Stanislav Kogiku \/ SOPA Images \/ LightRocket via Getty Images\nThis diversification naturally included merchandising. Many of the 10-year-olds who played the initial games were now adults with families of their own. This led to the launch of monpoke, a special line of Pok\u00e9mon-themed items for infants, as well as the now-discontinued Pok\u00e9mon Shirts, which sold button-up shirts and formal workwear based on various pok\u00e9mon.\nWith each of these efforts, alongside the launch of Pok\u00e9mon Go \u2014 which gave lapsed older audiences an accessible reentry point that could fit around their busy schedules \u2014 the franchise was suddenly less of a gaming curio and more an ingrained facet of modern life.\nBy the time the 2023 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships rolled around, the first to be held in Japan in Yokohama, the aforementioned Pikachu Outbreaks were transformed into a city-wide takeover. Beyond the competition and Pikachu marches were drone shows, pop-up Pok\u00e9mon Centers, an orchestral concert, an entire cruise ship transformed into the SS Anne, food collaborations, photo spots, station takeovers, and more. Yokohama felt less like a typical Japanese city and more like a location ripped directly from the world of Pok\u00e9mon itself. Within all that were families, often two or three generations, sharing in a mutual love of Pok\u00e9mon.\nThe results speak for themselves. In recent years The Pok\u00e9mon Company has recorded record profits and revenue, while the games, anime, and TCG are more popular than ever, with both new mainline Switch entries selling over 20 million copies. The phenomenon of growing out of Pok\u00e9mon is no longer a concern. Even if young kids stop playing the video games as they grow, that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t still engage with this world via other means. Nor does it mean they won\u2019t introduce their own children to the series in the future.\nPok\u00e9Tsume is a series that\u2019s only possible because of a reinvention of what Pok\u00e9mon can be. While, in reality, it\u2019s a mostly light, inoffensive promotional tool to sell games (it\u2019s no coincidence the second episode has a scene of a young kid playing the latest entries in the series on his Nintendo Switch), it represents everything the franchise has aimed to be in recent years. Rather than a series for children, Pok\u00e9mon now promises something for everyone. And those new adults seeking direction in life might find a fellow directionless 20-something employee more relatable than a kid wanting to be a Pok\u00e9mon Champion. Frankly, it\u2019s a way to see they aren\u2019t alone, no different from how your party of pok\u00e9mon kept you company through the deepest caverns of Mt. Moon.\n\nThis article, authored by Alicia Haddick, was published by The Verge on 2023-11-23 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":346}
{"title":"Shayda director Noora Niasari on family violence, Iranian liberation and taking her first film to the Oscars","context":"## Shayda director Noora Niasari on family violence, Iranian liberation and taking her first film to the Oscars\n\nWhen Noora Niasari was five years old, she lived in a women\u2019s shelter with her Iranian mother. They were fleeing family violence in a country that wasn\u2019t entirely familiar, trying to make a new life.\nThat personal experience has informed Niasari\u2019s debut feature, Shayda, which has been storming the global festival circuit since it premiered at Sundance film festival in January, winning an audience award. Released in Australia on 5 October, the film has already claimed the top prize at CinefestOz, opened the Melbourne international film festival, and been selected to represent Australia in the international film category at the Oscars.\nIt\u2019s a sensational reception for a first film, particularly given the specificity of its story: Shayda is a dramatisation of Niasari\u2019s early life, set in the Iranian diaspora community of suburban Melbourne. \u201cIt was something I had experienced, but I hadn\u2019t really seen on screen before,\u201d Niasari says of the movie she started thinking about straight after finishing film school. \u201cBut I first had to ask my mum for her permission and participation, because I had such a blurry memory of that time.\u201d\nNiasari asked her mother to write her memoirs, which took six months; that writing formed the basis of the first incarnation of Shayda\u2019s script. Shayda evolved over time \u2013 and it\u2019s not always a direct mirror of what happened to them both \u2013 but \u201cit is very emotionally true to our experience\u201d.\nExecutive produced by Cate Blanchett, Niasari\u2019s movie tells the story of Shayda (Zar Amir Ebrahimi), an Iranian immigrant in Melbourne who leaves her abusive husband Hossein (Osamah Sami) with her daughter Mona (Selina Zahednia) in tow. Shayda finds refuge in a women\u2019s shelter where the kindly Joyce (Leah Purcell) protects and guides her through the tough legal process of a custody fight.\nZar Amir Ebrahimi and Selina Zahednia as Shayda and Mona. Photograph: Miff\nIt\u2019s a tender and revealing film that balances Shayda\u2019s discovery of inner strength with the sacrifices she makes for her daughter, as she tries to create a new family for her. It\u2019s understated, relatable and drawn from such personal memories that Niasara describes working on it as \u201clong-term exposure therapy\u201d. Even doing interviews to promote the movie is difficult. \u201cI have to sit with it and process it,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBut the thing is, now that it\u2019s a film, it has a really different energy in the world. People bring their own experiences to it, it\u2019s a very universal experience. We\u2019ve screened it in Europe, North America and Australia and there is a real sense that it connects beyond my mother and I, beyond our experience. It\u2019s not about us any more.

Shayda\u2019s story may be centred on escaping abuse and fighting for custody of her child, but it\u2019s also about friendship, music, dance, laughter and reclaiming freedom. There\u2019s something elementally hopeful about the film.\n\u201cI always wanted to find that balance in the story because \u2026 it\u2019s life, there are ups and downs,\u201d she says. A large part of the film is devoted to the character holding on to the rituals of Persian New Year, and finding a way to connect with her culture amid the upheaval.\n\u201cFor her, that\u2019s through music and poetry and dance, and sharing that with her daughter. It became fundamental to the story. That was how I grew up as well. We\u2019re in the Australian suburbs but I lived in a Persian house with my mum\u2019s cooking and music.\n\u2018The world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now; it\u2019s not just me looking at my mum in admiration,\u2019 says Niasari. Photograph: Miff\n\u201cI grew up with all of the beauty of our culture. So I had a natural inclination to include those moments [in the film]. You can feel the joyous moments even deeper when you have that tension or darkness around it.\u201d\nIt has been a year since 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini died in custody, after being arrested for allegedly not complying with the country\u2019s hijab laws. Her death led to a huge wave of popular unrest in Iran; Niasari hopes renewed international awareness of Iranian women\u2019s resistance will lead to more stories being told.\n\u201cThe world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now; it\u2019s not just me looking at my mum in admiration. Shayda is just one of those women who happened to leave Iran and make her own sacrifices and her own life.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more and more important to showcase the diaspora experience as well, especially given what\u2019s happening in the world with displacement, exile and migration due to conditions in the country. So, I\u2019m really optimistic about the storytellers coming through and being able to tell a different kind of story.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Wenlei Ma, was published by The Guardian on 2023-10-01 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":347}

For me, I have never quit being a soldier, even though I was no longer actually serving in the capacity of a service member on duty. In my head, I've always been a soldier and I always will be,\" he continued.\nCOUNTRY STAR CRAIG MORGAN REENLISTS IN ARMY RESERVE AT 59\nThe \"Almost Home\" crooner said re-enlisting has been \"refreshing\" and \"very exciting.\"\nWATCH: Craig Morgan shares how he balances music career and serving his country: \u2018I have never quit being a soldier\u2019\n\"I'm proud, I'm honored, and I'm humbled to be a part of what I think is some of the greatest Americans in our country,\" Morgan continued.\nCOUNTRY MUSIC STAR AND VETERAN CRAIG MORGAN RELEASES FIRST ALBUM SINCE DEATH OF SON\n\"Less than 1% of the people in this nation \u2013 and I say this every night upstate \u2013 less than 1% of the people in our nation serve in this military and right now, recruiting is worse than it's ever been. So, we're going to do everything we can to try to encourage people to serve our country and to understand that it's not about self, and it's not even really about government.\"\nCraig noted that joining the Army is all about being a part of something that is \"so much bigger than yourself.\"\n\"There's a sense of pride and humility, two words that are very seldom able to coincide. And I tell people all the time, I think the military is one of the few places where that takes place. Law enforcement service to our country is where you can be very proud and humble at the same time. It's a different kind of pride, not an arrogant pride. It's a sense, a sense of humility, and I'm humbled beyond words to be able to be a part of that again,\" Morgan said.\nThe biggest challenge when Morgan was in active duty was the time commitment. He told Fox News Digital that there were moments when he was away from his family for a year at a time. When he was serving his country, it was not only his dedication that mattered but theirs as well.\nWATCH: Craig Morgan believes the 'most challenging' part about serving in the military is 'time'\n\"It not only requires a lot of dedication on the soldier's part, but dedication on the family's part. It's tough. It's very tough,\" he explained. Although there are challenges when joining the military, to Morgan the reward is worth it.\n\"The reward, again, is being around people that I think are some of the greatest Americans in the world,\" he said.\nMorgan says he balances his music career and being a member of the U.S. Army Reserve with a lot of \"coordination.\"\n\"So, all I really have to do is show up and do the one important thing and that's sing and entertain,\" he said of his music career.\n\"The military, on the other hand, requires a lot more of my personal thought process.

{"title":"3 Possible Opponents for CM Punk if He Returns to WWE at Survivor Series","context":"## 3 Possible Opponents for CM Punk if He Returns to WWE at Survivor Series\n\nOne of the most talked about in the pro wrestling fandom is CM Punk\u2019s next move following his exit from AEW. The Second City Saint was released from the Jacksonville-based promotion back in September 2023 due to his backstage altercation with Jack Perry at AEW All In 2023. Following this, there have been multiple speculations about what might be the former WWE star\u2019s next move. While he has been dropping multiple hints sparking rumors, fans are particularly inclined that he might return to his old stomping ground, WWE.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nThe speculations stem from the fact that the latest Premium Live Event Survivor Series will be held in his hometown, Chicago, Illinois. While the possibility of his return exists, there are a few WWE stars that he might lock horns with following his return at the Survivor Series.\nShinsuke Nakamura\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nThe recent cryptic promos by the King of Strong Style have left the fans scratching their heads. The promos which started several weeks ago, show Nakamura calling out to someone that he wants to have a duel with. The mystery opponent has not been revealed yet and according to reports, talents at WWE are pretty clueless as well. However, fans were pretty fast to decode who might be his opponent. At the fallout episode of Raw following Fastlane, Nakamura was particularly frustrated due to his loss against Seth Rollins.\nAs Ricochet was on his way walking down the ramp, Nakamura attacked him with CM Punk\u2019s finisher Go To Sleep. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this move, but it was popularly used by the former WWE star to secure his wins. It was after this that Nakamura\u2019s cryptic promos started airing. Fans might get to see a confrontation between him and Punk if he returns at the Survivor Series. As Nakamura is known to be quite persistent, a long rivalry between the two might be the center of Punk\u2019s return arc.\nSeth Rollins\nWhile this might come as an obvious piece of information considering Rollins has the WWE World Heavyweight Championship title, the reason behind it might be from outside the ring. When CM Punk made his return to WWE Backstage in 2019, many saw this as the precursor to his return to the company, including Rollins, who invited him to step into the ring with the Messiah.\nFast forward to January 2023 in an interview during the promotion of the WWE 2k23, The Visionary made his feelings for CM Punk after his backstage antics in AEW. Rollins referred to him as a \u201ccancer\u201d also stating that he should stay away from him and WWE. The following week when he made those comments, the current WWE World Heavyweight Champion decided to shed some light on his intentions.\nReferring to him as \u2018Chicago Phil\u2019, he said that he is as selfish as another WWE talent, Logan Paul. He even added that Punk has particularly helped him during his career but the former WWE star has taken a lot from the promotion as well. He believes that he might not be in the right headspace but he has to contribute somehow. Rollins even added that if he is not going to provide for the industry he does not deserve to be a part of it.\nThese comments by Rollins will be the setting stone for their rivalry. If CM Punk returns to WWE at Survivor Series, fans might get to see a minor confrontation or possibly a verbal confrontation between the two given the very real animosity between the two. It will also be a neat wrinkle in their character arc considering CM Punk brought forth the S.H.I.E.L.D. which is the faction that brought Rollins to prominence.\nCody Rhodes\nCM Punk and Cody Rhodes do have a lot of history. Both the stars were a part of All Elite Wrestling. Even though they were in the same promotion, the two never got a chance to spar. But Rhodes and Punk had a bout in WWE a while back during their initial days. The two had brawled on a couple of occasions. One was during a tag team match with his tag-team partner Ted Debiase Jr. The then World Tag Team Champions lost their title to CM Punk and his partner Kofi Kingston. Apart from that, the two had tussled in front of the 2008 Intercontinental Champion, William Regal.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nThe altercation ended and The American Nightmare came out as the winner of the fight. It\u2019s been more than a decade since that fight and fans will notice that Rhodes has grown leaps and bounds. In one of his last promos in AEW before departing for WWE, Rhodes says Punk laid the roadmap for a wrestling revolution. \u201cHe listed things that for me, were taboo at the time, like going to New Japan, working for Ring of Honor, he talked about teaming with the Young Bucks.\u201d\nHe then goes on to say it wasn\u2019t Punk who executed the revolution it was him. He says, \u201cHe was unable to do those things\u2026In his absence, in the void that CM Punk left behind, somebody did do each and every one of those things, I did them! I held every grain of that revolution in my hands and you cheered!\u201d From these words, it seems clear that Rhodes harbors a degree of bitterness toward Punk\u2019s fan welfare as he feels Punk just spoke of a wrestling revolution whereas he was the one to actually execute it. If Punk were to follow Rhodes to WWE and steal his thunder as he did in AEW, it\u2019s unlikely the American Nightmare would take too kindly to it. With both being masters on the mic, this has the makings of all-time classic rivalry, one fans have been clamoring for while the two were signed to AEW.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nWhich of these rivalries would you like to see if CM Punk returns for Survivor Series?\nWatch This Story: Every WWE Superstar Who Attacked Vince McMahon\n\nThis article, authored by Shaikh Aerajuddin, was published by Essentially Sports on 2023-11-21 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":349}
{"title":"The best Xbox controller to buy right now","context":"## The best Xbox controller to buy right now\n\nYou may not realize it, but we\u2019re living in a golden age of gaming controllers. The gamepads on the market now are higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from just a few console generations ago. If you\u2019re gaming on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you now have a plethora of great third-party options from the likes of PowerA, Scuf, Nacon, and Turtle Beach, as well as high-quality first-party controllers. The days of the cheap \u201clittle sibling\u201d controller that looked cool but barely worked are over.\nI\u2019ve spent a ton of time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may be unsurprising that the standard Xbox Wireless Controller is the best Xbox controller for most. It makes a great PC controller, too.\nBut while the de facto Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, there are several alternatives worth cross-shopping if you have specific needs \u2014 ranging from high-end options like the Xbox Elite Series 2 and Scuf Instinct Pro to quality budget picks like the PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller.\nWhat we\u2019re looking for Connectivity Is it wireless? Does it support Bluetooth? Or is it wired only? If so, is the cable replaceable? Quality Does it feel cheap or nicely made? Any glitches or reliability issues while testing? Extra features Does it have handy extras like remappable buttons, or extra ones? Customization Can you remap buttons or tune it with custom software profiles? Are there fun cosmetic flares to its design? Value Is it priced affordably, about average, or does it come at a steep premium?\nThe best Xbox controller for most people\nXbox Wireless Controller $ 45 $ 65 31 % off $ 45 $ 45 $ 65 31 % off The official Xbox Wireless Controller has a dedicated share button for saving clips and screenshots and sharing them online, Bluetooth support, and a USB-C port for charging up Microsoft\u2019s play-and-charge rechargeable battery. $45 at Target\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired \/ Connector type: USB-C \/ Mappable rear buttons: No \/ Software customization: No \/ Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable\nOkay, I already know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cThe best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?\u201d That may seem like a no-brainer, but this \u201cstandard\u201d controller truly does earn this title as the best option for most Xbox gamers. It may lack some of the extra features that we\u2019ll go over on premium options, but this controller is the distillation of four generations and numerous first-party controllers before it \u2014 and it shows.\nThis is the only affordable wireless Xbox controller out there, thanks to Microsoft\u2019s proprietary protocol. While some may hate that it comes with AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it\u2019s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. It also works as a wired accessory with a USB-C cable, and user-replaceable batteries mean you\u2019re not stuck with a controller that doesn\u2019t hold its charge after years of use.\nThe standard Xbox controller looks great, feels great, plays great, and is available in cool colors. AA batteries may not be ideal, but you can also use add-on rechargeable packs, like this one from Hori. Attention to detail: Microsoft color-matches the light-up Xbox button to the controller.\nBut the standard-issue Xbox pad isn\u2019t just great because of its connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller\u2019s $60 asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you\u2019re a hardcore fighting game fan, you may be better served by an arcade stick or a controller geared toward that genre \u2014 one with an impeccable D-pad like Hori\u2019s Horipad Pro \u2014 but the Xbox Wireless Controller is an exceptional jack-of-all-trades.\nThe only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity, though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its Xbox Design Lab, which ranges from $69.99 to $99.94 depending on the configuration. There\u2019s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick out one from the various colors Microsoft continues to offer.\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\nPowerA Enhanced Wired Controller $ 38 The PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller is a budget-minded wired controller for Xbox and PC that connects via Micro USB and features two customizable buttons on its rear. It\u2019s offered in many different colors and licensed designs. $38 at Best Buy\nConnectivity: Wired \/ Connector type: Micro USB \/ Mappable rear buttons: Two \/ Software customization: No \/ Power: Wired\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great controller but you don\u2019t have a lot of money to spend \u2014 and you don\u2019t mind a cable \u2014 PowerA\u2019s Enhanced Wired Controller offers an impeccable value without sacrificing too much. Its full retail price is $37.99, but some color schemes can dip as low as around $25. Speaking of colors, the Enhanced Wired Controller comes in a wide variety of hues and designs, including licensed ones from game franchises like Mass Effect and Fallout. Some of these designs may make you suspect these are cheap, cringe-inducing knockoffs, but the quality of the controller may surprise you when you use it.\nPowerA\u2019s Enhanced Wired Controller is quite a great bargain, with all kinds of colors and unique designs. The customizable rear buttons are easy to operate without getting in the way. If only this controller had USB-C instead of Micro USB.\nFirst off, let\u2019s get its biggest downside out of the way: it uses a Micro USB connection (gross, I know). You at least get a lengthy, detachable cable with it, but not having a reversible connector is annoying. Thankfully, nothing else about this controller feels so outdated. Its build quality is just fine, and it even has two mappable rear buttons built into the grips \u2014 which is great to have at such a low price.\nThe rest of the PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller is a whole lot of table stakes, but it executes everything quite well for a ridiculously affordable price. There\u2019s no impulse trigger rumble, but if there\u2019s any feature to cheap out on, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the right choice. On the flip side, the Enhanced Wired Controller comes with a two-year warranty, which is twice as long as pricey options like Microsoft\u2019s Elite Series 2 offer.\nRelated PowerA is adding the wrong kind of wireless to its wired Xbox controller\nPowerA offers a whole lot of bang for your buck with the Enhanced Wired Controller if you\u2019re on a tight budget. It also now sells the Advantage Wired Controller, which is essentially a newer version of the Enhanced Wired Controller with USB-C and hair-trigger lockouts. The Advantage could be a shoo-in to dethrone the Enhanced Wired as the best budget controller, but at $37.99, it can\u2019t yet match the Enhanced Wired\u2019s near-perpetually discounted price.\nIf you have Elite controller tastes but a standard controller budget, the PowerA Fusion Pro 3 is a fine alternative if you don\u2019t mind that it\u2019s wired. It looks a bit like the Microsoft Elite Series 2, complete with four rear buttons, trigger lockouts, and rubberized grips, but costs much less. The new Fusion Pro 3 is significantly lighter than its predecessor, plus it has a more compact case and is $10 cheaper \u2014 offering quite the value for $79.99 (especially if it starts going on sale). The older Fusion Pro 2 is still fine, especially if you prefer detachable rear paddles to built-in buttons, but at this point, it\u2019s only worth it for that preference or if it\u2019s heavily discounted.\nPowerA Fusion Pro 3 $ 79 The Fusion Pro 3 is the latest version of PowerA\u2019s affordable alternative to premium controllers like the Xbox Elite Series 2. It comes with swappable sticks, friction rings, a compact zip-up case, and features four programmable buttons built into its rear. $79 at Amazon$80 at PowerA\nThe best premium Xbox controller\nXbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 $ 140 $ 180 22 % off $ 140 $ 140 $ 180 22 % off The Xbox Elite Series 2 is easily one of our favorite controllers at The Verge. It\u2019s an improvement on the already excellent Elite controller, with deep customization, optional rear paddle buttons, a swappable D-pad, and analog sticks that allow you to tailor its layout to suit your play style. $140 at Walmart$140 at Microsoft\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired \/ Connector type: USB-C \/ Mappable rear buttons: Up to four \/ Software customization: Yes \/ Power: Built-in rechargeable\nThe Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft\u2019s fancied-up, premium version of the stock controller. It\u2019s also older, having been released a year before the Xbox Series X \/ S consoles arrived. So while it does sport a USB-C port and wireless support, it lacks the convenient Share button found on the latest Xbox Wireless Controller. However, it makes up for that in droves with exceptional build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, and lots of customization.\nIf you pick up an Xbox Elite controller, you instantly recognize the quality of materials put into it. Where the standard controller uses an unassuming plastic build, the Elite mixes higher-quality plastic with rubberized grips and bits of metal. Combine this with its built-in rechargeable battery, and the Elite is noticeably heavier than its cheaper brethren. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging.\nThe Xbox Elite Series 2 is made from premium materials but has a nice, subdued aesthetic. The metal, dish-like D-pad is a small work of art. Sadly, however, it\u2019s a far cry from the best D-pad around. The four removable paddles on the rear sit beneath the trigger locks and charging dock pins.\nAs excellent as the fit and finish are, the key components that may give you a competitive edge are the hair-trigger locks and rear paddle buttons. In theory, the hair trigger gets shots off faster when playing shooters, and the rear paddles allow you to jump, crouch, reload, etc., without taking your thumb off the right stick for aiming. However, using that many buttons on the back of the controller definitely takes some adjustment. You have to train new muscle memory, and since it requires dexterity with more fingers, they\u2019re not for everyone.\nThese premium features come at a steep cost, too. The Elite Series 2 is normally priced at $179.99, and even though it occasionally drops to $139.99, it\u2019s still more than twice as expensive as a regular Xbox controller. You have to really want its extra features and user customization, and if you\u2019re not using its rear paddles or the software adjustments for stick sensitivity, you\u2019re not getting your money\u2019s worth. (And if you want to customize the colors, you\u2019re looking at $209.99 for the Design Lab \u201cElite Package.\u201d)\nMicrosoft also has a stripped-down Elite Series 2 \u201cCore\u201d version for $129.99, which is the same controller in white-and-black, red-and-black, or blue-and-black finishes without the rear paddles, accessory charging case, or extra stick toppers and D-pad. You can get all of those in a $59.99 accessories pack, which turns the Elite Series 2 Core back into a standard Elite Series 2, but that sets you back $10 more than just going for the Elite Series 2 to start with.\nYou must also be aware that the Elite has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control, with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller\u2019s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. However, when you nail that perfect sequence \u2014 switching to your pistol and landing a headshot with a quick pop-pop of the hair trigger while your thumbs stay firmly planted on the sticks \u2014 it can feel worth it.\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired \/ Connector type: USB-C \/ Mappable rear buttons: Four \/ Software customization: No \/ Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable\nThe Scuf Instinct Pro finds itself in a bit of a weird spot, as it\u2019s the only wireless option from a third party, but it\u2019s by far the most expensive Xbox controller around (it starts at $199.99). The one I tested clocked in at $263.91 with a special faceplate and added color accents. That\u2019s more than the Xbox Series S occasionally sells for, which is an entire console. Still, you\u2019re in for a treat if you\u2019re okay with spending that kind of money, as the Instinct Pro is arguably better than Microsoft\u2019s Elite in some very specific ways \u2014 primarily, its comfort and implementation of rear buttons and hair triggers.\nScuf\u2019s Instinct Pro is ultra-premium and very customizable \u2014 for an added cost. The magnetic faceplate and sticks are easy to pop off and swap out. Scuf\u2019s rear rocker buttons and textured rubber grips are intricately detailed.\nThe Instinct Pro has very unique rear buttons, and I actually prefer them. Instead of paddles, there are four rocker-like buttons built into the controller\u2019s body that you push toward or away from your hand with a middle finger. It still requires training your brain a bit to get accustomed to it, but I found them more intuitive.\nRear buttons aside, the Scuf\u2019s other big feature is its hair triggers, which have the quickest response of all the controllers tested here. Just flick a switch on the back, and the left and right triggers feel like you\u2019re clicking a mouse \u2014 it\u2019s incredibly satisfying. The hair triggers, rear buttons, and the excellent textured grip material on the controller\u2019s underside make this controller a joy to use.\nThe Instinct Pro feels like Scuf essentially hot-rodded a stock Xbox controller, but like any boutique item, it comes with a massive cost. Meanwhile, it still uses AA batteries and lacks software customization, so as much as I enjoy using it, I\u2019d only advise getting one if you\u2019re super passionate about its very specific qualities or you absolutely love the colorful accents and magnetically swappable faceplates on Scuf\u2019s configurator.\nThe best customizable controller\nConnectivity: Wired \/ Connector type: USB-C \/ Mappable rear buttons: Four \/ Software customization: Yes \/ Power: Wired\nRIG\u2019s Nacon Revolution X may be worthy of an award for terrible naming, but its real strengths are in its deep customization. If you\u2019re the type that likes to endlessly tinker with lots of detailed settings, this is the controller for you. Normally priced at $99.99, the wired Revolution X and its added features don\u2019t come cheap, but the price is a little fairer when you consider the competition it squares up against.\nWhen you first pick up the Revolution X, it seems very unassuming \u2014 and borderline cheap. While it\u2019s not a looker, it\u2019s a form-follows-function type of controller. It\u2019s comfy to use, and its four rear buttons built into the grips are large and nicely contoured. The real stars of this show, however, are the analog sticks and their software customizations, as well as the expansive custom options for other inner workings of the controller.\nThe Nacon Revolution X looks a little cheap at first, but its premium features are steeped in deep customization. The rear grip covers open up to allow the optional weights to be added. The controller, cable, stick tops, grip weights, and stick rings are all packaged in the included zipper case.\nWhile other user-customizable controllers have three user profiles you can swap between on the fly, the Revolution X has four \u2014 plus a \u201cclassic\u201d mode with basic settings and a ring of RGB light around the right stick to remind you what mode you\u2019re in. The software app is not the most user-friendly, but the controls go very in-depth. Thankfully, there are helpful starting points with presets for arcade fighting games, racing, FPS games, and even sniping, which makes the options much easier to understand. Add the ability to customize and remap every button on the controller, as well as a Dolby Atmos for Headphones app license, and you\u2019ve got a lot of customization options.\nThe customization doesn\u2019t stop with software, audio, or lighting, however. The Revolution X comes with ring spacers to adjust the range of the analog sticks, too, as well as a series of small weights ranging from 10g to 16g, which you can insert into its grips to give them an additional amount of heft.\nAdding up all these features, you see why the Nacon is such a great controller for tinkering. It took me time to warm up to it, but upon setting it up the way I preferred, it made for a very compelling controller in a variety of game types.\nThe best controller for shooters\nConnectivity: Wired \/ Connector type: USB-C \/ Mappable rear buttons: Two \/ Software customization: No \/ Power: Wired\nTurtle Beach is known for its headsets, so it makes sense that its Recon wired controller features some robust audio controls. Its strengths really come into focus when playing first-person shooters, where its Superhuman Hearing mode tweaks the audio of any wired headset to draw out footsteps and distant gunfire in the mix. At its regular price of around $60, and once selling as low as $39.95, the Recon is a fairly affordable way to gain a slight competitive edge in multiplayer games without spending well over $100 on a controller.\nThe Turtle Beach Recon controller\u2019s biggest strengths lie in its plethora of audio controls. It\u2019s a bit much to take in at first, but these buttons allow for very handy audio controls when using a wired headset. The bumpers, shoulders, and customizable rear buttons have an excellent textured pattern that feels great.\nThis pad isn\u2019t going to win any beauty contests thanks to all those awkward buttons located smack-dab in the middle of its forehead, but each one has a valid purpose. There are four levels of microphone monitoring, overall game volume controls, game chat volume mix, four EQ presets, four programmable modes for mapping the two rear buttons, and four levels of optional right-stick sensitivity adjustments. That last feature, dubbed Pro Aim by Turtle Beach, lowers the sensitivity of the right analog stick while you hold the right-hand rear button, allowing for very small movements like sniping, though it\u2019s a bit clumsy to use.\nLearning to use all these controls may sound daunting, but the controller\u2019s quick-start guide makes it easier. Superhuman Hearing is very helpful for shooters and worth using extensively for games like Halo Infinite \u2014 just be aware that it\u2019s going to muddy up the soundtrack a little, so you may want to leave it off during story-driven, single-player games.\nAudio controls aside, the Recon lacks fancy features like hair triggers and swappable thumbsticks, and the D-pad looks like the standard Xbox Wireless Controller but pales in comparison. The controller\u2019s plastic build feels cheap, but the rubbery grips redeem it with a nice and comfy feel. As for the sticks, triggers, and additional rear buttons, they all feel tight and snappy. Combine that with Superhuman Hearing, and you\u2019ve got a great recipe for shooters.

{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","context":"## The best deals on MacBooks right now\n\nApple sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points. The offerings start with the 13-inch MacBook Air from 2020 at $999 and go all the way up to the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro starting at $2,499. But finding a deal on a current Mac with an M1, M2, or even the new M3 chip \u2014 as well as the higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max \u2014 is actually not that difficult.\nWhile Macs may not experience perpetual discounts, it\u2019s not uncommon to see various current models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without as much waiting for the changing winds of deals to blow your way. Apple\u2019s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.\nBut if you want to buy new and you\u2019re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available right now.\nA note about discounted Intel-based Macs At this point, we don\u2019t recommend buying any older Intel-based Macs. Retailers may try to tempt you with very low prices on leftover new or refurbished stock, but there\u2019s a reason nobody wants them anymore. They\u2019re completely outclassed by all the newer models, unless you have some super-niche Windows Boot Camp needs \u2014 and even then, consider what Windows apps you really need and if they work with Parallels.\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nM1 MacBook Air\nThe MacBook Air is Apple\u2019s entry-level laptop. It\u2019s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air has been with us for a bit \u2014 there\u2019s now even a 15-inch M2 Air \u2014 but the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains in the lineup as the budget option. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it\u2019s long enough in the tooth to have been fully dethroned in our guide to the best laptops.\nThe base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It typically sells for $999, but Amazon and Best Buy are currently discounting it to $749.99 ($250 off), matching its lowest price. The M1 Air may be a few years old now but it\u2019s still hard to beat in terms of value \u2014 especially when it comes to everyday performance and battery life.\nM2 MacBook Air\nAs for the newer, fancier 13-inch MacBook Air with M2, the base model with 256GB of storage and an eight-core GPU recently got a price drop. Along with introducing a 15-inch M2 Air, Apple announced during this year\u2019s WWDC that the 13-inch model now starts at $1,099 instead of $1,199. As for deals, the 13-incher is currently selling for $899 ($200 off) at B&H Photo, Additionally, Best Buy and B&H Photo are offering an equal diacount on the upgraded configuration, which can be had with a 512GB SSD and 10-core GPU for $1,199 ($200 off).\nThe M2 MacBook Air is a super slim and light laptop with a 1080p webcam that\u2019s actually usable as well as a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its precious two USB-C ports. Its M2 processor didn\u2019t kick-start a revolution like the M1 generation, but it\u2019s a great performer for any user outside of more demanding creatives.\nIt does have some slight downsides, like slower storage in the base 256GB configuration and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, there hasn\u2019t been a more travel-friendly laptop offered by Apple since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this one\u2019s good enough to be the No. 1 laptop we now recommend in our buying guide.\nThe newer 15-inch MacBook Air with M2 is a lot like a blown-up 13-inch Air, and judging from our glowing review, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Like its smaller counterpart, it has an M2 chip, two Thunderbolt 4 \/ USB-C ports, MagSafe charging, and its base model comes with a 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM. But it differs by having a larger, 15.3-inch notched screen with 2880 x 1864 resolution, six speakers instead of four, a 10-core GPU that costs extra on the 13-inch, and a higher starting price of $1,299. Bumping up to a larger, faster 512GB of storage will run you $1,499.\nSurprisingly, the 15-inch M2 Air started receiving some discounts even before it shipped, which let early adopters save between $50 and $100. As of right now, you can get it $300 off by ordering it at Amazon or Best Buy, where it\u2019s currently selling for $999. The expanded 512GB model is also $300 off at Best Buy, selling for $1,199.\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nThe MacBook Pro line is once again in a transitional phase. Apple announced Macs using a new M3 processor at its \u201cScary Fast\u201d event the night before Halloween, including a new 14-inch MacBook Pro that replaces the 13-inch M2 model. That means Touch Bar Macs are finally dead, but some of those outgoing M2 models are still available for now. You\u2019ll find any deals on them further down, but first, let\u2019s focus on the new M3 generation.\nM3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe new entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C \/ Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).\nThe M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it\u2019s still a very good laptop \u2014 especially if you can get it on a deal that puts more price distance between it and the M3 Pro version. We\u2019ve already seen the base model with 512GB of storage on sale for $150 off during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and right now, it\u2019s actually available for an even better $1,399 ($200 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The 1TB configuration is also selling for its all-time low of $1,599 ($200 off) at Best Buy and B&H Photo, while the configuration with base storage and 16GB of RAM is selling for $1,599 ($200 off) at B&H Photo. That said, if you plan on going with a higher-spec configuration than that, you\u2019ll likely want to spring for the M3 Pro model instead (see below).\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros for late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C \/ Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you\u2019re willing to pay more, as exhibited by the review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model, which cost an eye-watering $7,199.\nWhile these models are still quite new, versions that actual humans buy have begun receiving discounts. The 14-inch MacBook Pro in its base configuration with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU \/ 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD is currently on sale for $1,749 ($250 off) at B&H Photo. A similar version with 1TB of storage and a 12-core \/ 18-core M3 Pro is down to $2,149 (also $250 off) at B&H Photo. As for the base 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (12-core CPU \/ 18-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, it\u2019s selling for $2,249 ($250 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\nM2 Pro MacBook Pro\nAs for the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros from early 2023 with M2 Pro \/ Max processors, they\u2019re still more than capable \u2014 they may even be a better buy than the new models if you can find them at a steep discount.\nFor example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M2 Pro chip, a 512GB SSD, and 16GB of RAM is selling for $1,629 ($370 off) at Amazon, which is a new low price that may not last very long. However, the 14-inch model with 1TB of storage, a 12-core M2 Pro CPU, and 19 GPU cores is down to $1,999 (a steep $500 off) at B&H Photo. Now we\u2019re talking!\nSadly, the situation isn\u2019t quite as good for the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M2 Pro. The best (and only) deal available right now on the creator-friendly laptop is at Amazon, where you can grab the base M2 Pro model for $2,299.99 ($200 off) with 512GB storage. That\u2019s not great, but hopefully we see better deals before the laptop is no longer available new.\nM1 Pro and M1 Max MacBook Pro\nFor now, the older 2021 MacBook Pros can occasionally be had for some steep discounts that actually make a two-generation-old laptop still worth considering. You\u2019re unlikely to find any base models still kicking around, but if you want a souped-up configuration on the cheap, you may be in luck.\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro from 2021 with 16GB of RAM and an expanded 1TB of storage is available at B&H Photo for $1,799 ($900 off). However, you can also get a tricked-out M1 Max (10-core CPU \/ 32-core GPU) model with 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage for $2,499 ($1,800 off) at B&H Photo. I know that\u2019s not exactly affordable, but that laptop once sold for $4,299 and still performs well in 2023.\nThe best Mac Mini deals\nThe latest Mac Mini comes in a base configuration with Apple\u2019s M2 processor or in a more powerful configuration with the M2 Pro. It\u2019s an excellent upgrade to one of the most affordable yet performant desktop computers you can get (as long as gaming isn\u2019t your priority). The M2 Mac Mini starts with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for $599, while the M2 Pro model features a superior processor plus gigabit ethernet, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $1,299.\nThe latter model also features an expanded port selection, from two USB-C ports to four. It\u2019s almost like getting an M2 Pro-powered MacBook Pro 14 but in desktop form. However, keep in mind that buying any Mac Mini means you have to provide your own mouse, keyboard, and monitor.\nRight now, the base M2 Mac Mini is selling for a new all-time low of $479 ($120 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, while the M2 Pro version is selling for a respectable $1,149 ($150 off) at B&H Photo. The M2 Mac Mini remains a great value for a desktop computer, with the M2 Pro version functioning like a baby Mac Studio for much less.\nRelated The best thing about my Mac Studio is its mustache\n\nThis article, authored by Antonio G.

{"title":"European roundup: Bellingham helps Real Madrid go top while Bayern draw","context":"## European roundup: Bellingham helps Real Madrid go top while Bayern draw\n\nBayern Munich struck twice in the second half to come from two goals down and snatch a 2-2 draw at RB Leipzig but the champions dropped to third in the Bundesliga with their second draw of the season.\nGoals from Leroy San\u00e9 and Harry Kane cancelled out Leipzig\u2019s first-half lead but the result left Bayern on 14 points, two behind the leaders, Bayer Leverkusen.

After the break we showed a different mentality. It was a bit wild, with a lot of risk but it is a positive result, not to lose after being 2-0 down. We showed character.\u201d Bayern travel to Copenhagen in the Champions League next week.\nLeipzig struck twice in six minutes with Lo\u00efs Openda putting them in front in the 20th when he completed a quick break.

Real\u2019s coach, Carlo Ancelotti, said: \u201cIt was a solid, convincing game.

{"title":"Michigan didn't need Jim Harbaugh against Penn State, but Ohio State is a different game","context":"## Michigan didn't need Jim Harbaugh against Penn State, but Ohio State is a different game\n\nDid Michigan really need Jim Harbaugh on Saturday?\nPerhaps the result provides the short-term answer. No. 3 Michigan beat No. 10 Penn State 24-15 at Beaver Stadium on Saturday. The Wolverines threw one pass in the second half \u2013 and that didn't even technically count \u2013 in a risk-averse game plan under acting coach Sherrone Moore. The defense smothered the Nittany Lions, and that will lead to more buildup ahead of the showdown with No. 1 Ohio State on Nov. 25.\nThen Moore let it all there in the Fox postgame interview with Jenny Taft. Even if the answer is no, Harbaugh was ever-present.\n\"I want to thank the Lord and I want to thank Coach Harbaugh,\" Moore said. \"I f------ love you man. I love the s--- out of you, man. I did this for you, for this university, the president, our AD. We've got the best players, best university, and the best alumni in the country. I love these guys. These f------ guys right here. These guys right here. These guys did it.\"\nMORE: Sherrone Moore gives tearful interview after Penn State win\nWhoa, let's add the FCC standards to the Wolverines' list of potential violations. If Michigan (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten) was not the college football heel heading into the final two weeks of the regular season, then they are public enemy No. 1 now. It might be \u201cMichigan vs. Everybody,\u201d and everybody has the same question.\nWill Harbaugh be on the field before the end of the regular season? The Big Ten made a Friday ruling that will prohibit Harbaugh from being on the field for the final three regular-season games as a result of the in-person scouting and sign-stealing scandal that led to the resignation of staffer Conor Stallions. ESPN reported there will be a temporary restraining order hearing on Nov. 17 that will answer that question.\nOn the field, Michigan answered the question about its College Football Playoff. Sort of. The Wolverines proved they could beat Penn State (8-2, 5-2) in a 20-yard box. Neither team completed a pass of 20 yards or more. Michigan trailed 3-0 after the first quarter. The Wolverines had eight carries for 10 yards, and Penn State's Abdul Carter set the tone with a jarring hit on Blake Corum that nearly resulted in a fumble.\nMichigan took control with the running game. Donovan Edwards ripped off a 22-yard run, and Corum added a 44-yard run to set up a 3-yard TD run. Edwards added a 22-yard TD run on the next drive. The same \u201cLightning and Lightning\u201d tandem that burned the Nittany Lions last year staked Michigan to a 14-9 halftime lead.\nMORE: Michigan got off easy with Harbaugh suspension\nThen, the Wolverines took the ball out of quarterback J.J. McCarthy's hand. The Wolverines had 30 rushing attempts and zero passing attempts save a pass to tight end Colston Loveland that drew a pass interference call. McCarthy finished 7 of 8 passing for 60 yards in what has to be the most conservative play-calling victory in a top-10 showdown in recent memory. Was this old-school Big Ten football or Big Ten West football in disguise?\nMichigan's defense clamped on Penn State quarterback Drew Allar (10 of 22, 70 yards, TD), and the Nittany Lions had one play of more than 20 yards. Corum closed the drama with a 30-yard TD.\nThe same-old questions about Nittany Lions coach James Franklin in big games resurfaced, but those are back-page headlines in the Big Ten East race. The quirky tiebreaker involving Big Ten West opponents? That's out the door. The winner-take-all showdown between Ohio State and Michigan? There are a full two weeks of anticipation for that now.\nHarbaugh reportedly watched the game from the team hotel, and now the leading piece of drama returns. Moore's postgame emotion was a headline, but there is a reality that set in through a brutal watch of a second half.\nMcCarthy is a leader. Corum (26\u2013145, 2 TDs) and Edwards (10-52, TD) can grind on anybody. The defense now has allowed just 7.5 points per game.\nBut the Wolverines will not be able to beat Ohio State the same way they beat Penn State. That 20-yard box will stretch across the entire country, and it requires a coach ready to make those legacy-defining decisions. The Buckeyes have Heisman Trophy candidate Marvin Harrison Jr., and he was the separator when Ohio State beat Penn State 20-12 on Oct. 21. The Buckeyes have a top-five defense, too, and all of the back-and-forth rage between those rivals will reach a 1970s pitch \u2013 1973 for those who know \u2013 as they barrel toward another 11-0 vs. 11-0 showdown at the Big House.\nWho is the good guy? Who is the villain? Ohio State and Michigan locked in their answers a long time ago. More than 17 million people watched last year's matchup \u2013 a 45-23 Michigan victory where Stalions' involvement continues to be scrutinized through a double-barrel Big Ten and NCAA investigation. Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti's ruling sent a shockwave through the conference Friday, mainly because the third game means Harbaugh will not be on the sideline for The Game. Early forecasts say 20 million will tune in for The Game this year.\nWill Harbaugh really not be there? That is for the courts to decide, but Moore\u2019s comments suggest Harbaugh, president Santa Ono and athletic director Warde Manuel are on a united front; consequences be damned in 2024 and beyond.\nIn the short term? The College Football Playoff committee could slide Michigan up to No. 2 now, and the debate with the Buckeyes and No. 1 Georgia is going to perk up more than ever. They are the three best teams in the country, but only one has uncertainty with the head coach.\nWhether they admit it or not, Michigan still needs Harbaugh for those moments, especially in two weeks.\nThe reality is he might not be present for that one either.\n\nThis article, authored by Bill Bender, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-11 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":353}
{"title":"The Steam Deck OLED improves much more than its screen","context":"## The Steam Deck OLED improves much more than its screen\n\nIn early 2022, Valve released my favorite video game console. But even I had some gripes. With the Steam Deck, I could \u2014 for the first time \u2014 play the bulk of my sprawling collection of video games wherever I\u2019d like. But I tended to bundle it with a huge portable power supply. I also couldn\u2019t quite shirk how much better games looked on our family\u2019s OLED TV.\nAnd yet, for me, an adult with limited time to play video games alone in a quiet room, nothing could beat the Steam Deck\u2019s freedom. Barring the occasional diversion, Valve\u2019s handheld PC had served as my preferred gaming option ever since I published our review. Then, last week, the Steam Deck OLED arrived. It\u2019s as if the Steam Deck team collected a laundry list of complaints about the original, then responded to all of them one by one.\nPolygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it\u2019s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun \u2014 and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch .\nIt appears, at first glance, that Valve cribbed from Nintendo\u2019s playbook with the Switch OLED, for which Nintendo upgraded the device\u2019s screen but not its guts. In terms of raw power, the Steam Deck OLED is identical to the original Steam Deck. Valve says this synchronicity is meant in part to continue to provide developers with a single goal when optimizing their games \u2014 though it promises that the Steam Deck 2 (which the company hopes to release in two to three years) will have a generational power leap.\nFor those who haven\u2019t tried a Steam Deck, though, I wouldn\u2019t wait for its sequel. Because while Valve hasn\u2019t upped the horsepower, it has improved practically everything else. The Steam Deck OLED has longer battery life, faster Wi-Fi, and a stand-alone Bluetooth module. And the screen isn\u2019t just OLED; it\u2019s HDR OLED \u2014 the first HDR OLED screen on any gaming portable, with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits for HDR content and 600 nits for SDR (for comparison, the original screen\u2019s peak brightness was 400 nits). And somehow, with all of these additions, the Steam Deck OLED is lighter.\nSo, goodbye, old Steam Deck; hello, new Steam Deck.\nThe Steam Deck OLED delivers on Valve\u2019s original promise\nOLED is in the name for a reason.\nThe OLED panel in the new Steam Deck is lighter, thinner, and more power efficient than its LCD predecessor. It\u2019s also bigger and faster. Though the device has the same shape as the original Steam Deck, smaller screen bezels allow for a display that\u2019s slightly larger, at 7.4 inches compared to 7 inches. The panel has a wider color gamut (110% DCI-P3, for the visual obsessives) and the beautiful, inky blacks that OLED dorks like myself adore.\nSteam Deck OLED\u2019s bigger, better battery Valve\u2019s promise of 30-50% more battery raised one obvious question: Is that comparing the OLED model with a Steam Deck running its original firmware (which had poor battery life), or a Steam Deck using the latest firmware? Valve\u2019s answer: the latter! So if you\u2019re a Steam Deck owner, expect those big battery improvements over your current Steam Deck experience.\nThe OLED panel also has a 90 Hz refresh rate \u2014 perfect for frame doubling from 45 frames per second. In case that jargon means nothing to you, suffice it to say that gameplay on the Steam Deck OLED looks smoother. The improved 90 Hz refresh rate falls short of the Asus ROG Ally\u2019s 120 Hz, though it\u2019s worth considering that the higher the frame rate, the faster the battery drain \u2014 assuming you can even spot the difference between 90 Hz and 120 Hz.\nYou know what\u2019s more interesting than a list of technical specs? Actually seeing the screen. It\u2019s gorgeous. On Sunday morning, I picked at Sega\u2019s Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name while watching football and Christmas movies with my family. The new Yakuza game looks fantastic on high settings at 60 fps, its night sequences flaunting the OLED\u2019s dark blacks and the abundance of neon signage showcasing the HDR.\nI got so distracted pulverizing bad dudes that it took me some time to notice the Steam Deck OLED\u2019s most welcome feat. When playing AAA games on the original Steam Deck, I had always kept the handheld plugged into an outlet. But with the OLED model, a couple of hours had passed before I realized I\u2019d forgotten to connect the charger.\nThe OLED screen makes for a fancier Steam Deck, but it\u2019s the battery life (and some tweaks throughout the design to carve out more of it) that lets Valve\u2019s new handheld truly deliver on its promise of a portable gaming PC.\nAll the tiny, delightful improvements of Steam Deck OLED\nSince the original Steam Deck launched, Valve has been improving the hardware through updates \u2014 its team estimates around 300 to date. That will continue with both the Steam Deck OLED and the original Steam Deck, the latter of which will get a fresh BIOS update to align itself with some of the former\u2019s upgrades. The original device will see some battery life improvement; just don\u2019t expect the OLED model\u2019s jump of 30-50%.\nSome changes \u2014 even smallish ones \u2014 demand new hardware. And so, alongside the big improvements, Valve has made a gaggle of minor physical upgrades with its new iteration. The Steam Deck OLED now includes a Wi-Fi 6E radio (great if you have a modern router and connection to make use of it) and a dedicated Bluetooth module, which allows for improved audio quality with wireless headphones, the option to wake the Steam Deck from a controller, and the capability to connect many Bluetooth controllers for multiplayer. The haptics are noticeably improved, with a wider frequency range. And the touchscreen is markedly better \u2014 it\u2019s responsive to the point where I don\u2019t feel the need to plug in a USB-C keyboard anytime I need to type a few words.\nA review for spec specifics If you\u2019re the sort of person who likes the nitty-gritty technical details of screens and batteries, we also recommend reading The Verge\u2019s review.\nValve also claims that the Steam Deck OLED is more repairable, which, mercifully, I didn\u2019t have the need to test for myself. (Parts will once again be sold through iFixit.) However, I did enjoy the new power supply, with its faster charging (45 minutes gets you from 20% to 80%) and 2.5-meter cable that stretches the length of my couch.\nOne small, charming detail: The carrying case now has a tinier carrying case within it. If you want to be extra cautious, stick to the original bulky case. But if you need to toss the Steam Deck in your backpack for a day trip? Go with the slim case that has funny little thumbstick nipples!\nAll of the tweaks, large and small, amount to a perfect handheld \u2014 made better by the price, which remains the same as the original Steam Deck available today, just that the OLED will come with more stuff. Valve will be selling three models:\n$649 - 1 TB OLED (up from 512 GB)\n$529 - 512 GB OLED (up from 256 GB)\n$399 - 256 GB non-OLED Steam Deck (up from 64 GB)\nPlus, for a limited time, the company will offer a special edition 1 TB Steam Deck OLED made with a translucent shell for $679 \u2014 only in the U.S. and Canada. Though let\u2019s be real: This thing will sell like hotcakes and Valve will reconsider the definition of \u201climited supply.\u201d Have I considered ordering one of these limited editions? Yes. But I am also practicing restraint. Like, how many Steam Decks should one human have?\nI suppose that\u2019s the question, really. If you already have a Steam Deck, is the OLED model technically an incremental improvement? Yes. But you might find that the screen and the battery justify the double dip. For someone like me, who puts hundreds of hours into the Steam Deck each year, the upgrade is inescapable.\nAnd if you don\u2019t have a Steam Deck? How many times can I say it: This is my favorite console ever. And it just got better.\nThe Steam Deck OLED will be available Nov. 16 to purchase through the Steam storefront.

{"title":"Epic v. Google, explained","context":"## Epic v. Google, explained\n\nOn Monday, Fortnite publisher Epic Games will drag a tech giant into court, alleging that its mobile app store is an illegal monopoly. You may be feeling some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!\nAfter all, didn\u2019t Epic already go to trial with Apple, resulting in a ruling where Apple (mostly) won? Didn\u2019t Epic fail to #FreeFortnite with its Llamacorn legal gambit? Didn\u2019t that all happen years ago? What are we doing here again?\nThe short answer: while Epic\u2019s antitrust claims against Apple got their day in court, a similar lawsuit against Google never did. On November 6th, Epic v. Google will finally go to trial... a mere 1,180 days after Epic originally sued.\nHi, I\u2019m Sean, and I\u2019ll be your guide to this whole delightful mess.\nUpdate, December 15th, 2023: It\u2019s basically over now. What happened? Read this, this, and this to get the whole picture.\nOriginal story continues:\nLlamacorn what now? What is happening?\nBefore we get to the Llamacorn, a little background. Epic is of course the studio behind Fortnite, the extraordinarily popular free-to-play game. Fortnite makes money by selling in-game items with its virtual currency V-Bucks. Players often buy V-Bucks the same place they play Fortnite. And until August 13th, 2020, if the player used an Android or iOS device and installed the game through an official app store, that purchase triggered an in-app payment fee to Google or Apple.\nCritics call such fees the \u201cGoogle tax\u201d or the \u201cApple tax,\u201d and Epic definitely wasn\u2019t a fan.\nWhen Epic decided to take action against these respective \u201ctaxes,\u201d it made August 13th, 2020 a very busy day for Apple, Google, Epic, and us here at The Verge. First, Epic announced it was bypassing Apple and Google\u2019s app store fees. It deployed a hotfix update to Fortnite without either company\u2019s knowledge, letting you purchase V-Bucks directly through its own payment processing option at a discount. Apple and Google almost immediately reacted by kicking Fortnite off their app stores for breaking the rules.\nThen: surprise! Epic was ready and waiting with two lawsuits and an attack ad, depicting a Fortnite hero throwing a unicorn-llama hammer into a giant screen reminiscent of Apple\u2019s famous \u201c1984\u201d Macintosh ad.\nIt was a striking publicity blitz followed by a lot of slow-moving court proceedings. While the Apple lawsuit went to court in 2021, the Google one was delayed again and again. A ruling came down for the Apple trial that September, and it was mostly decided in Apple\u2019s favor, though both parties are waiting for the Supreme Court to potentially weigh in. Meanwhile, the machinations for its fight against Google continued, and now\u2026\nIt is time for trial number two.\nThat sounds fascinating, but if I don\u2019t care about Fortnite or rich companies suing each other, what\u2019s in it for me?\nThe future of Google\u2019s app store could depend on this trial \u2014 both Epic and Google agree on that. Epic wants to break up Google\u2019s alleged monopoly on Android app stores and payment methods, so developers aren\u2019t stuck paying the \u201cGoogle Tax\u201d or passing that fee along to you.\nBut if Epic wins \u2014 according to Google, anyhow \u2014 it could make Android phones less safe by dismantling basic protections against sideloaded apps, and damage Android\u2019s ability to compete with the iPhone because it (arguably) can\u2019t run a competitive app store by giving it away for free.\nOr maybe you just want juicy dirt on both companies? More on that later!\nWhat exactly is Epic claiming?\nEpic argues that Google makes it so difficult for developers and users to get around its Android app store, and that app store\u2019s standard fees, that it\u2019s created an illegal monopoly that unjustly enriches Google while artificially driving up app prices because other stores can\u2019t compete.\nEpic also claims that Google is illegally tying its Google Play payments platform to the Google Play app store, keeping other potential app payment mechanisms from competing as well.\nSo, does Google have a monopoly?\nA monopoly on what? That\u2019s one of the biggest questions the court will decide. Epic claims that Google has illegal monopolies in \u201cAndroid app distribution\u201d and \u201cAndroid in-app payment processing.\u201d It\u2019ll argue that if you buy or develop for Android phones, you\u2019re stuck paying the Google tax.\nBut Google will say the real competition is from Apple, because people can choose to buy an iPhone instead. It\u2019s pretty tough to argue Google has a monopoly on app stores in general.\nThis whole line of argument is called \u201cmarket definition.\u201d If the court decides the relevant market is phones and app stores, not specifically Android ones, then Google\u2019s on the road to victory. If it accepts that Android apps are their own market, Epic will be in better shape. Or, it could pick a different market definition entirely, like the judge in the Apple case ended up doing.\nLooking at this from a less academic perspective, it\u2019s worth noting that Google charges up to ten times more per transaction than you pay with PayPal or a credit card, which does seem like a lot! And though Epic can\u2019t argue it in court, I\u2019ll point out that Apple wasn\u2019t able to explicitly justify a 30 percent fee to that case\u2019s judge.\nOn the other hand, it does kinda seem like Epic wants something for nothing! As far as I can tell, Epic hasn\u2019t stated what kind of fee would actually be reasonable for Google to charge in exchange for placement in Google\u2019s store \u2014 instead, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney seemingly suggests there shouldn\u2019t be a Google fee at all if a developer wants to use its own payment system.\nHow did Epic\u2019s argument fare against Apple?\nWell\u2026 both sides lost! But Epic arguably lost more. Even though Apple has incredible power over the iPhone, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled the company didn\u2019t have an unfair monopoly in this case \u2013 partly because she decided the relevant market for Fortnite was \u201cdigital mobile gaming transactions\u201d rather than, say, iPhone apps. She also decided that Epic violated its developer agreement with Apple and would have to pay.\nBut she also barred Apple from keeping iPhone users in the dark about alternate ways they can pay for apps \u2013 and may have even allowed developers to add their own payment mechanisms. I won\u2019t dwell on the Apple ruling, as I\u2019m ethically bound, but my colleague Adi Robertson has a comprehensive breakdown.\nHow can Epic possibly have a case against Google when Apple already won?\nEpic declined to answer this on the record, among other questions we asked... but three things to consider:\n1) That was a different case. Also, that one\u2019s not over till the Supreme Court weighs in or declines to take a look.\n2) Google can\u2019t tell jurors that Apple won its case, or that other plaintiffs settled. The judge in this case says so!\n3) Oh, and by the way, this is a jury trial.\nWait, why does that matter?\nEpic and Google have to convince a jury, not the judge, which is totally different from how the Apple case played out. (That one was a \u201cbench trial.\u201d)\nMaybe all the evidence of tricky deals inside Google might sway a jury against the company? Maybe Google scaremongering that sideloaded apps equal gaping security holes will sway a jury against Epic instead? Who knows!\n(If you\u2019re a Epic juror reading this \u2014 stop! Judge Donato explicitly said you\u2019re in a \u201cnews-free bubble\u201d through mid-December, folks.)\nDidn\u2019t other parties sue Google too?\nThey did! And then, they all settled. All 50 state attorneys general and a number of consumers have tentatively settled with Google over app store antitrust claims, though it\u2019s not clear what the deal might include.\nMatch Group, the company behind Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid and other dating apps, just reached a surprise last-minute settlement too, one that makes it sound like Match effectively gave up.\nEpic stands alone.\nCould we get a settlement between Google and Epic as well?\nEpic seems to have no interest in settling as long as the \u201cGoogle tax\u201d exists, and the company\u2019s repeatedly said it\u2019s not interested in cash. So far, the company\u2019s been willing to push these cases all the way through multiple appeals, cost be damned.\nIt\u2019s not clear what Google could proactively offer that would satisfy Epic, since CEO Tim Sweeney has also publicly suggested that Google would simply circumvent any settlement it offers.\nBut if you do want to see a vision of a future that Epic would accept, look no further than this letter it sent to state attorneys general \u2014 laying out a settlement that would basically prohibit Google from doing the anticompetitive things that Epic claims it did.\nThere\u2019s also this tweet from Sweeney:\nGoogle wouldn\u2019t tell The Verge if it\u2019s offered Epic any kind of settlement yet.\nWhy if I just want the dirty laundry on both these companies? You promised dirt...\nOh, it could get good.\nThe allegations made before trial suggest Google was playing loads of dirty tricks with names like \u201cProject Hug,\u201d \u201cProject Agave,\u201d and \u201cProject Banyan\u201d, with Epic claiming it\u2019s seen evidence Google was paying off game developers and phone makers not to abandon its app store \u2014 to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Google allegedly even toyed with the idea of buying Epic to keep Fortnite from inspiring other game developers to abandon ship.\nPlus, there\u2019s evidence Google deleted potentially incriminating messages to keep them out of a court\u2019s hands. Enough that the judge has decided to explicitly tell the jury we\u2019re not seeing all the evidence, because Google employees all the way up to CEO Sundar Pichai were caught setting those conversations to auto-delete. This issue has come up in the US v. Google antitrust trial in Washington, DC \u2014 still ongoing at the start of Epic\u2019s trial \u2014 as well.\nAnd the dirt isn\u2019t all on Google\u2019s side. Epic was caught straight-up admitting it premeditated the whole plan to bypass Google\u2019s payment systems. Since Google is countersuing over that, it could be a big deal.\nWhen you say \u201cstraight-up admitting...\u201d\nHere is an email from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney that, I think, speaks for itself:\n\u201cHere is our official plan for communicating with Google about bypassing the Google Play Store: SAY NOTHING TILL IT SHIPS\u201d Image via Epic v. Apple\nWe\u2019ll have a whole cast of intriguing people called as witnesses during the trial who might dish even more.\nWho will Epic and Google call as witnesses?\nWe are going straight to the top of the org chart, folks. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney are absolutely expected to attend. Android co-founder Andy Rubin might be deposed, and Google says we\u2019ll hear from current Android (and Chrome, and Chrome OS) boss Hiroshi Lockheimer. Google also tells us representatives from Apple, Netflix, Motorola, and AT&T should testify as well.\nHow much hypocrisy can we expect in the courtroom?\nI\u2019d say quite a bit! For example:\nEpic says it\u2019s not in this for the money, it\u2019s only suing to end Google\u2019s monopoly \u2014 but Epic would surely profit if it doesn\u2019t have to pay Google\u2019s cut.\nIt looks like Epic\u2019s going to argue that you\u2019re locked into Android after buying an Android phone, but I can personally attest that switching back and forth between the platforms is easier than ever.\nGoogle will say that every Samsung Galaxy phone has \u201ca competing app store right there on the homescreen,\u201d even though Google apparently tried to quash that store, too, fearing it could cost the company billions.\nWe caught Google trying to play the China card in a pre-briefing with press, reminding us that Epic is 40 percent owned by Chinese company Tencent \u2014 even though Google itself allegedly considered teaming up with Tencent to eliminate the Epic threat. While the parties can\u2019t argue it in court, Google can attempt to subtly play the China card: \u201cGoogle may ask a witness once about Tencent\u2019s domicile,\u201d reads one of Judge Donato\u2019s orders.\nIn the same press briefing, Google suggested to journalists that Epic should have joined the company\u2019s \u201cUser Choice Billing\u201d program if it wanted an alternative payment system, instead of suing. But that program didn\u2019t exist until 2022, long after the lawsuit, and it only knocks 4 percentage points off Google\u2019s fee.\nWhen should we expect a jury verdict?\nJudge Donato told jurors that we\u2019re looking at roughly five weeks of trial starting November 6th and extending through early December. The schedule suggests the court will take Thanksgiving off, finish looking at all the evidence by December 4th, take a couple more days off before closing arguments, and then let jurors come to a decision.\n\u201cI fully expect we\u2019ll have plenty of time to reach a verdict well before the December holiday period,\u201d said Judge Donato.\nOkay, I\u2019m sold \u2014 how can I watch the trial unfold?\n\nThis article, authored by Sean Hollister, was published by The Verge on 2023-11-05 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":355}
{"title":"Patrick Kane destinations: Sabres, Red Wings among potential landing spots for free agent winger","context":"## Patrick Kane destinations: Sabres, Red Wings among potential landing spots for free agent winger\n\nThe NHL's version of \"The Decision\" is almost here, as free agent winger Patrick Kane is closing in on signing with a team for the 2023-24.\nOK, maybe it's not nearly as big as LeBron James' NBA free agency choice in 2010, but it's close. Kind of. Maybe tens years ago when Kane was in the middle of his prime, but I digress.\nThe three-time Stanley Cup champion has been on the market since the turn of the new season. The longtime Blackhawks star was traded last year at the deadline, as Kane wanted another shot at winning a Cup and was not interested in sticking around for Chicago's rebuild. He went to the Rangers, but New York was knocked out in the first round of the playoffs leaving Kane to hit free agency for the first time in his career.\nIt was announced during the summer that the winger would be undergoing surgery on his hip and that he likely would not make a decision until he was ready for a return. That's exactly how things played out, as the start of the season began with Kane not on an NHL roster, continuing to rehab from the offseason operation.\nIt's no secret that Kane isn't the offensive dynamo he was in his prime. He's always been a defensive liability, but it's stuck out more in recent years with his production on the decline. It's hard to say how much the hip injury affected his short time with the Rangers, but Kane was far from impressive in the Big Apple.\nRegardless, the 35-year-old is ready to get back on the ice, and there are no shortages of interested suitors. Despite Kane's camp trying to keep everything hush-hush, the rumors and reports have been flying ever since the start of the campaign. It was reported that Kane could make a decision before Thanksgiving, but the holiday came and went without any news of a deal, however it is expected to come soon.\nMORE: Ranking the NHL's top 50 players for the 2023-24 season\nHere are some potential landing spots for Kane as he gets set to return to the NHL.\nPatrick Kane potential destinations\nBuffalo Sabres\nThe Sabres have a leg up on everyone when it comes to the Kane sweepstakes. The reason? The winger is a Buffalo native, having grown up in the southern part of the city. He has been connected to the Sabres dating back to last season when the rumors of an inevitable breakup between Kane and the Blackhawks began to surface, and Buffalo has plenty of cap space to sign the wing this time around.\nBringing in Kane would greatly help Buffalo's struggling offense and power play. Entering the final week of November, the Sabres are averaging 2.81 goals per game, the eighth-lowest mark in the league. The power play is clicking at 16.4%, 23rd in the NHL. The dynamic winger has collected about 32% of his career points on the man advantage, as he can be an excellent set-up man or one-time option on the dot.\nThe problem is that the Sabres have not been as good as expected to start the 2023-24 season. Buffalo was viewed as a team that would take the final step out of the rebuild this year, given how close the team was to the postseason last year. If Kane has his eyes set on joining a Stanley Cup contender, the Sabres are no longer atop that list, sitting under .500 and sixth in the Atlantic.\nFlorida Panthers\nThe Panthers are the defending Eastern Conference champions, and have continued the momentum from their Cinderella Cup run into the 2023-24 season, sitting tied for third in the conference and second in the Atlantic. In terms of contenders, they are right there in the East, and Kane could have the chance to play with a dynamic center like Aleksander Barkov.\nFlorida has an older group, so there would not be as much messing up the mojo like if Kane joined the baby Sabres. The Panthers don't have a ton of cap, but with roughly $1.7 million available, they could make it work. Plus, it's South Beach. Who wouldn't want to live in the Miami area and play hockey?\nThe issue could boil down to travel. There have been reports that Kane isn't as keen on signing in the Western Conference due to the lengthy hours spent going from arena to arena. Well, when it comes to the East, no one has it worse than the Panthers and Lightning, given their geographical location in Florida.\n\"To be perfectly honest, there was one person who said to me, look, if you\u2019re worried about the travel in the Western Conference, why would you want to go to Florida when Florida and Tampa Bay have the worst travel in the Eastern Conference?\" Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman reported. \"They\u2019re remote outposts compared to a lot of the other places.\"\nDetroit Red Wings\nWhen Kane was traded from the Blackhawks to the Rangers in the spring, it wasn't just to join a playoff contender. It was a reunion between Kane and his former Chicago teammate Artemi Panarin. The two created magic during Panarin's first two years in the NHL, leading to a Hart Trophy and Art Ross Trophy for Kane in 2015-16.\nFor the Red Wings, they don't have Panarin, but this summer, they did acquire one of Kane's other wing partners from the Blackhawks \u2014 Alex DeBrincat. Kane was DeBrincat's main set-up man when the current Red Wings star was potting 40 goals a season. Kane admitted in the past that when DeBrincat was traded from Chicago to Ottawa it was \"disappointing\" and \"crushing,\" and this would give him another shot at playing with the talented sniper.\n\"I\u2019m really curious about the Detroit one,\" Friedman said. \"They have the cap room, they have the space on the roster, they\u2019re doing very nicely so far this season. As we look on Sunday night, they\u2019re sitting there very much in contention in the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference.\n\"So, I definitely think there\u2019s a lot of people wondering about Detroit and whether or not he ends up there.\nThe Red Wings have the fifth-most cap space in the league, so money isn't an issue. It was assumed one of Buffalo, Ottawa or Detroit would take the last step out of the rebuild and become contenders, and through the early going, it looks like the Wings are that team. Adding Kane could be just the move the Winged Wheel needs to solidify their spot as a playoff contender.\nDallas Stars\nOne of the dark horse teams that could potentially land Kane is Dallas. The Stars look like one of the best teams in the Western Conference, and there have been reports that Kane would love to end up with the organization.\nThe thing is, the Stars already have tons of depth at forward. You could argue that, on paper, Dallas may have the deepest top-nine forward group in the league. Adding Kane would mean someone like Mason Marchment or Evgenii Dadonov gets dropped to the fourth line, and neither are fourth-line players.\nWhich is why it makes sense that the rumblings around the Stars and Kane are that the player is much more interested in the team than the other way around. The Stars are up against the cap, and would have to move money around to make it work financially.\n\"I think Kane would love to play there, I\u2019m just not sure Dallas thinks it\u2019s the best idea for them,\" Friedman said. \"I think they feel if they\u2019re going to add, it\u2019s going to be on defense.\"\nWhile adding Kane, who has a desire to play in Dallas, is appealing, don't fix what ain't broke, right?\n\nThis article, authored by Bryan Murphy, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-27 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":356}
{"title":"ASX to rise after interest rate hopes boost US shares","context":"## ASX to rise after interest rate hopes boost US shares\n\nThe laggards On the losing end, energy companies (down one per cent) weighed down the index. Woodside (down 0.8 per cent), Santos (down 0.4 per cent) and Ampol (down 1.2 per cent) dropped, along with coal miners Yancoal (down 1.7 per cent) and Whitehaven (down 2 per cent). Lynas Rare Earths (down 3.1 per cent) was the biggest large-cap decliner, while industrials companies (down 0.2 per cent) including Computershare (down 2.9 per cent), Seven West Holdings (down 1.9 per cent) and Worley (down 1.3 per cent) were also weaker. The lowdown\nTMS Capital portfolio manager Ben Clark said the big news for markets on Monday was the trading update from Westpac, which he said led a resurgence in the banking sector\u2019s performance. \u201cWestpac\u2019s results were better than expected, especially because it\u2019s been a bit of a perennial underperformer in the past few years,\u201d he said, adding that it set the tone for results from NAB and ANZ, which are due to report in the next week. Loading Clark also said there was a reversal of the interest-rate trade seen in recent weeks. \u201cLong-term bond yields came off quite significantly in the last few days following weaker than expected employment data on Friday, which has seen some investors swivel back into growth stocks,\u201d he said. The market has now switched from pricing in an 80 per cent chance of a rate rise on Tuesday to 50-50, Clark said.\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 climbed 40.56 points on Friday, or 0.9 per cent, to 4,358.3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 222.24, or 0.7 per cent, to 34,061.32, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 184.09, or 1.4 per cent, to 13,478.28. Stocks surged through the week on rising hopes that the Federal Reserve is finally done with its market-crunching hikes to interest rates, in order to get inflation under control. A report on Friday underscored that pressure is easing on inflation after it showed employers hired fewer workers last month than economists expected. It\u2019s a stunning turnaround from just a week ago, when Wall Street was reeling after the S&P 500 had fallen 10 per cent below its high point for the year. That sent Wall Street\u2019s main index into what investors call a \u201ccorrection.\u201d Since then strong profit reports helped drive some stocks to towering gains. Generac, a maker of back-up generators, soared nearly 28 per cent for its best week since its stock began trading in 2010. At Expedia Group, another stronger-than-forecast report sent its stock nearly 22 per cent higher for its best week since the market was surging out of the coronavirus crash in early 2020. But it was interest rates, yields and inflation that were at the centre of all the wild movements for financial markets around the world.\nBefore last week, stocks had been struggling under the weight of rapidly rising Treasury yields. Those yields were in turn catching up to the Fed\u2019s main interest rate, which is above 5.25 per cent and at its highest level since 2001. Loading Higher rates and yields slow the economy, hurt prices for investments and raise the risk of something breaking within the financial system, such as the three high-profile US bank failures that rattled financial markets during the spring. \u201cIt was really fear that the Fed was going to go too far,\u201d said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management. The Fed put such pressure on the economy intentionally, hoping to starve inflation of its fuel. It wants the job market to cool, particularly pay raises going to workers. The Fed fears too-strong pay gains could create a vicious cycle that keeps inflation high.\nAnalysts said Friday\u2019s jobs report offered encouraging signals for the Fed, with average hourly earnings rising less in October from September than expected, though it doesn\u2019t mean the job is done. Treasury yields in the bond market tumbled immediately after the jobs report, releasing more of the pressure that had built up on Wall Street. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.52 per cent from 4.67 per cent late Thursday and from more than five per cent last week, when it hit its highest level since 2007. In the US, traders are moving up expectations for when the first cut to interest rates by the Fed could happen, potentially by the summer, according to data from CME Group. Such cuts can act like steroids for financial markets. For investors around the world, the \u201cFed matters more than other central banks,\u201d and weak US data is \u201cthe only game-changer for markets\u201d, foreign-exchange strategists at Bank of America wrote in a BofA Global Research report. A separate report on Friday said growth in US services industries, such as finance and construction, was weaker last month than economists expected.

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nIt may be over a decade since Britney Spears and Kevin Federline ended their marriage, but the former couple continue to have their ups and downs when it comes to co-parenting their two teenage sons, Sean Preston and Jayden.\nAhead of the release of the pop star\u2019s memoir, The Woman in Me, which is due for release on 24 October, fans are anticipating Spears will share new details about her relationship with her second husband, Federline.\nSpears has previously been open about her co-parenting struggles with Federline. Last year, he claimed their children were keeping their distance from Spears, who was embracing her newfound freedom following the end of her 13-year long conservatorship by posting several nude images on social media.\nFrom marriage to divorce to co-parenting, here is a complete timeline of the drama between Britney Spears and Kevin Federline.\nThe \u201cToxic\u201d singer and the former backup dancer began their whirlwind romance back in 2004, when Federline worked as a backup dancer for Justin Timberlake. Federline recalled his first meeting with Spears to People back in 2008.\n\u201cI met her at a club in Hollywood, Joseph\u2019s. Our eyes met and that was it. We just hit it off right away,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned real fast how much of a whirlwind the press and everything was.\u201d\nAfter just three months of dating, the two tied the knot in September 2004 during a surprise wedding ceremony in Studio City, California. Federline was 26 years old at the time, while Spears was just 22. Earlier that year, Spears was also married to her childhood friend Jason Alexander, but their marriage was annulled after just 55 hours.\nThe former couple welcomed their first child, son Sean Preston, weeks before their one-year wedding anniversary, and their second son Jayden James in 2006. At the time, Federline was already a parent to his daughter Kori Madison, now 21, and son Kaleb Michael, 19, with ex fianc\u00e9e Shar Jackson.\nJust eight weeks after the birth of their second child, Spears filed for divorce from Federline in November 2006, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d. In the couple\u2019s initial divorce settlement, which was finalised in July 2007, they were granted joint legal and physical custody over their two children.\nSinger Britney Spears with ex-husband Kevin Federline in 2006 (Getty Images)\nSpears suffered a mental breakdown in 2008 and was placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold, leaving Federline to retain sole custody of their boys. In February of that year, Spears entered into a conservatorship with her father Jamie Spears, who took complete control over her assets.\nSince Spears and Federline\u2019s divorce, it seemed the two were amicably co-parenting their sons when they were seen supporting their boys at their soccer and football games. Federline moved on to his now wife Victoria Prince. The two share daughters Jordan Kay, 12, and Peyton Marie, nine.\nIn 2018, things took a turn when Federline requested an increase of $20,000 a month more child support payments from Spears. After months of court discussions, Federline rejected Spears\u2019s child support proposal and instead doubled his request to $40k a month. A settlement was finally reached between the two parties in September 2018, with Spears increasing her child support payments to Federline from $20,000 to $35,000 a month.\nAmid her father\u2019s health crisis and ongoing emotional distress, Spears voluntarily checked into a mental health treatment facility in 2019. After hearing the news, Federline\u2019s attorney Mark Kaplan told Entertainment Tonight: \u201cKevin commends Britney for recognising that she needs to take a step back and that she is taking the reasonable steps to dealing with her situation in a responsible way. He wishes everyone well.\u201d That same year, Federline was granted 70 percent custodial rights and Spears 30 per cent.\nAfter years with her father in control of her finances and personal life, Spears was finally granted freedom from her conservatorship in November 2021. The singer made a powerful testimony at her conservatorship hearing that June, where she spoke out for the first time about her experience, calling for those involved to be \u201cput in jail\u201d. Following the testimony, Federline expressed his support for the singer, saying he \u201conly hopes the best for her because when the best for her is achieved, it\u2019s the best for their kids.\u201d\n\u201cThe best thing would be for their mom to be healthy and happy,\u201d his lawyer said in a statement at the time. \u201cAnd if either of those things aren\u2019t true, it doesn\u2019t provide for the best setting for custody to be exercised.\u201d\nBritney Spears poses with her sons Jayden James and Preston at Dodger Stadium in 2013 (Getty Images)\nIn June 2022, Spears married her longtime boyfriend Sam Asghari during an intimate ceremony at their Los Angeles home, just one month after the singer revealed she suffered a miscarriage.\nWhile celebrities like Madonna, Paris Hilton, and Selena Gomez attended the festivities, Spears\u2019 close family \u2013 her mother Lynne, father Jamie, sister Jamie-Lynn, and her two sons \u2013 were not present at the nuptials.\nAlthough their marriage last only 14 months, with Asghari filing for divorce in August this year, the actor and former dancer was previously praised by fans over his continuing support for Spears amid her conservatorship and custody battle.\nIn August 2022, Federline claimed during an interview with ITV that their teenage sons found it \u201ctough\u201d seeing their mother sharing nude photos online, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how it feels to be a teenager having to go to high school.\u201d\nSpears hit back at her ex-husband in a statement shared to her Instagram Stories responding to Federline\u2019s \u201churtful\u201d comments. \u201cIt saddens me to hear that my ex husband has decided to discuss the relationship between me and my children \u2026 As we all know, raising teenage boys is never easy for anyone,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt concerns me the fact that the reason is based on my Instagram \u2026 It was LONG before Instagram \u2026 I gave them everything \u2026 Only one word: HURTFUL.\u201d\nAsghari went on to accuse Federline of using their sons to \u201cvilify\u201d his wife, and claimed her ex-husband\u2019s \u201cgravy train will end soon, which probably explains the timing of these hurtful statements.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no validity to his statement regarding the kids distancing themselves and it is irresponsible to make that statement publicly,\u201d Asghari wrote on Instagram.\nFollowing Federline\u2019s comments, Spears\u2019s attorney Mathew Rosengart said in a statement obtained by Variety that Federline has created \u201clegal issues\u201d for himself, after posting private videos of Spears sternly speaking with her children without her consent.\n\u201cWhether he realises it or not, Mr Federline has not only violated the privacy and dignity of the mother of his children, he has undermined his own children, whose privacy he should protect,\u201d the statement read. \u201cPutting aside his ITV interview, Mr Federline\u2019s ill-advised decision to post an old video of his 11 and 12-year-old children was cruel, bottom of the barrel stuff. It was abhorrent.\u201d\n\u201cIn addition to demeaning himself and violating societal norms, he has now also created various legal issues for himself, including, but not limited to, implicating cyber-harassment and cyber-bullying statutes, among other things.\u201d\nThe Woman in Me hits shelves in the US and UK on 24 October.\n\nThis article, authored by Meredith Clark, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-20 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":358}
{"title":"Point Spread Betting - What is a Point Spread Bet?","context":"## Point Spread Betting - What is a Point Spread Bet?\n\nPoint spread betting is a bet on the difference in the score between teams (or players) in a specific game or event. The favored team is provided a point spread or handicap to try to equalize the odds with the less-favored team.\nTo place a point spread bet, select either the favored team or the underdog and predict if they will surpass or fall short of the given point spread. The odds for both teams are set to try to even out the bets on both sides.\nThe best sports betting sites provide a daily menu of point spread bets in dozens of sports and events.\nWhat is a point spread bet?\nA point spread is a predetermined margin set by bookmakers to level the playing field between two teams. Then, you bet on whether:\nThe favored team will win by more than the spread\nor\nThe underdog will lose by less than the spread (or just win outright)\nIn a point spread, the favorite is the team expected to win and is typically assigned a negative point value, indicating the number of points by which they need to win for a bet on them to be successful.\nThe underdog is the team expected to lose and is typically assigned a positive point value, indicating the number of points they can lose by for a bet on them to be successful.\nIf the underdog wins the contest outright, they\u2019re also the spread winner.\nWhat does betting \u2018against the spread\u2019 mean?\nMost generally, betting against the spread just means placing a point spread bet.\nYou\u2019re betting on the underdog to either win outright or lose by fewer points than the specified point spread, or you\u2019re betting on the favorite to win by a margin greater than the specified point spread.\nIn a secondary definition that distinguishes between betting \u201cwith the spread\u201d or \u201cagainst the spread,\u201d the latter term means you\u2019re betting on the underdog.\nWhat does \u2018covering the spread\u2019 mean?\nCovering the spread means that a team has surpassed the expectations set by the point spread and, thus, won the bet.\nFor the favorite, it means they won by more than the specified number of points. For the underdog, it means they either won outright or lost by fewer points than the specified spread.\nHow do point spread odds work?\nAlongside point spread bets, the odds will indicate the potential payout relative to the wagered amount. These odds are typically close to even because the point spread is designed to level the playing field between two teams.\nThe odds can be presented in various formats, such as American (e.g., -110 or +110), Decimal (e.g., 1.91), and Fractional (e.g., 10\/11), each providing a different way to express the same potential payout.\nDo point spread odds change?\nYes, point spread odds can change, and these shifts are commonly referred to as \"line movement.\"\nLines move when the point spread or the odds associated with a particular bet change after sportsbooks have initially set them. There are several reasons for these adjustments.\nOne of the most common causes is an imbalance in the amount of money being wagered on one side of the bet. If a significant majority of bettors are placing their money on one team to cover the spread, the top sports betting apps will adjust the point spread to make the other side more appealing, thereby balancing the betting action.\nAnother factor that can affect the spread odds is the occurrence of unexpected events, such as injuries to key players, changes in team strategies, or even significant weather events that might impact a game's outcome.\nFor instance, if a star quarterback is announced as injured just days before a big game, the point spread might shift in favor of the opposing team.\nMoreover, information and public perception play a role. If a piece of news or a prevailing sentiment starts to gain traction about a particular team's increased chances of winning, this can influence how people bet, leading sportsbooks to adjust their lines accordingly.\nPoint spread odds can and do change based on a combination of actual betting patterns, unexpected events, and shifts in public perception. Savvy bettors keep a close eye on these line moves, as they can offer insights into where the value lies in a particular bet.\nPoint spread betting outcomes\nWhen placing a point spread wager, there are a few potential outcomes:\nThe favorite can cover the spread by winning by a margin greater than the specified point spread\nThe underdog can either win the game outright or lose by fewer points than the spread, thereby \"covering\" the spread themselves\nThere's the possibility of a \"push,\" where the difference in the game's score exactly matches the point spread, resulting in the return of the original bet to all bettors\nHow to win a point spread bet\nSuppose an NBA betting site has set the point spread for a Los Angeles Lakers-New York Knicks game at the Lakers -7.\nThis means the Lakers are the favorites and are expected to win by 7 points.\nIf you place a spread wager on the Lakers, to win your bet, the Lakers must win the game by more than 7 points.\nLet's say the final score is Lakers 110, Knicks 100. The Lakers won by a margin of 10 points. Since this is more than the 7-point spread, if you bet on the Lakers, you would win your wager.\nHow you lose a point spread bet\nSay an NFL betting site has set the point spread for a Chicago Bears-Miami Dolphins game at the Bears -4. This indicates that the Bears are the favorites and are expected to win by 4 points.\nIf you make a spread bet on the Bears, you're betting they'll win by more than 4 points.\nHowever, let's assume the final score turns out to be Chicago Bears 24, Miami Dolphins 23. In this scenario, the Bears have won the game by only a 1-point margin.\nSince this is less than the 4-point spread, if you had the Bears, you would lose your wager. Despite the Bears winning the game, they failed to \"cover\" the 4-point spread, leading to a loss for those who wagered on them.\nWhat is a push in a spread bet?\nA \"push\" in betting refers to a situation where the final result of an event matches the set point spread, resulting in neither a win nor a loss for bettors. When a push occurs, the wagers are typically refunded.\nFor instance, let's consider an NFL game where the Dallas Cowboys are favored by 7 points against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nIf the game ends with the Cowboys winning by exactly 7 points, those who bet on either team experience a push. Their wagers would be refunded as the Cowboys neither exceeded nor fell short of the 7-point spread.\nSportsbooks often employ half-points in their lines to avoid this scenario. (They don\u2019t want to return bets.) For example, if our point spread was Cowboys -7.5, the game could not possibly end in a push.\nPoint spread betting by sport\nSpread betting is popular across sports, but there can be slight differences. Let\u2019s break it down.\nPoint spread odds in football\nSay a hypothetical NFL point spread for the Patriots and Steelers has the Patriots as -5.5 favorites. If you bet on the Pats, they must win by 6 or more points for a winning wager. Betting on the Steelers would win if they either win outright or lose by 5 or fewer points.\nPoint spread odds in basketball\nSay an NBA point spread has the Warriors as -9 favorites over the Raptors. To win a bet on the Warriors, they need to win by 10 or more points. Bets on the Raptors would win if they either win outright or lose by 8 or fewer points.\nIf the score is Warriors 110, Raptors 104, Raptors bets win since they lost by only 6 points. A 115-104 Warriors win would mean they covered the spread by 11 points.\nPoint spread odds in baseball\nIn a hypothetical MLB matchup between the Yankees and the Red Sox, the Yankees are set as -1.5 favorites on the \"run line\" (baseball\u2019s point spread). Betting on the Yankees requires them to win by 2 or more runs.\nFor Red Sox bets to win, they must either secure a victory or lose by just 1 run. If the score ends Yankees 5, Red Sox 4, Red Sox bets win. Conversely, a 6-3 win for the Yankees covers the run line with a 3-run margin.\nPoint spread odds in hockey\nAt NHL betting sites, the \"puck line\" is akin to the point spread. In a game between the Canadiens and the Blackhawks, with the Canadiens as -1.5 favorites, they'd need to win by 2+ goals for their bettors to win.\nBlackhawks bets win if they either triumph outright or lose by only one goal. If the score is Canadiens 3, Blackhawks 2, Blackhawks bets win since the Canadiens' one-goal victory doesn't cover the 1.5-goal spread. A 4-1 win for the Canadiens would mean they covered the spread by a 3-goal margin.\nSee more: Tonight's NHL betting lines\nPoint spread odds in soccer\nIn a hypothetical MLS game between LA Galaxy and Atlanta United, LA Galaxy is set as a -1 favorite on the goal line. They'd need to win by 2+ goals for bets on them to succeed. Atlanta United bets win if they either triumph outright or lose by a single goal.\nWith a score of LA Galaxy 2, Atlanta United 1, Atlanta bets win. However, a 3-1 win for LA Galaxy covers the spread with a 2-goal victory margin.\nSee more: Best soccer betting sites\nPoint spread odds in tennis\nAt tennis betting sites, point spread betting is usually based on games or sets, termed \"game handicap\" or \"set handicap.\" In a match between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, if Williams is a -4.5 favorite, she must win by a 5-game margin for her bettors to win.\nFor example, a match score of 6-4, 6-2 for Williams gives a 6-game margin, covering the -4.5 spread. Betting on Sharapova at +4.5 wins if she wins outright or Williams wins by fewer than 5 games. Set handicaps work similarly but focus on the number of sets won by each player.\nPoint spread odds in golf\nIn golf betting, betting often centers on outright winners or head-to-head matchups. However, there's also \"stroke handicap\" betting, akin to point spreads but with golf strokes.\nFor example, in a head-to-head bet between Tiger Woods and Jordan Spieth, if Woods is given a -2.5 stroke handicap as the favorite, he'd need to outplay Spieth by 3 strokes or more to win the bet.\nBetting on Spieth at +2.5 means he either wins outright or Woods wins by just 1 or 2 strokes.\nPoint spread betting FAQ\nHow does point spread betting work?\nPoint spread betting is a form of wagering where a sportsbook assigns a \"spread\" to level the playing field between two teams. One team, deemed the favorite, will have points deducted, while the other team, the underdog, will have points added.\nThe favorite must win by more than the spread to \"cover\" and be considered a winning bet, while the underdog must either win outright or lose by fewer points than the spread to be a winning bet.\nWhat does the (-) in point spread betting mean?\nThe \"(-)\" symbol denotes the favorite and indicates by how many points the favorite must win to \"cover\" the spread.\nWhat does the (+) in point spread betting mean?\nThe \"(+)\" symbol denotes the underdog and indicates the additional points given to that team for the purposes of the bet.\nWhat happens to my point spread bet if there\u2019s a tie?\nIf a point spread bet results in a tie, also known as a \"push,\" most sportsbooks will refund the amount wagered. This means neither the bettor nor the sportsbook wins or loses money on that particular bet. To avoid pushes, sportsbooks often use half-points (like 7.5 or 6.5) in their spreads.\nLooking at this question a different way, if there\u2019s a tie in the literal matchup, many spread bets should still have winners and losers. Say the Cleveland Browns are -1.5 favorites over the Baltimore Ravens, but this NFL matchup ends in a 21-21 tie after overtime. The Ravens would win that spread bet because the margin of victory (0) was narrower than 1.5.\nRelated Pages:\n\nThis article, authored by Sam Eggleston, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":359}
