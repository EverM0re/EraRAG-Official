{"title":"Michigan sign-stealing scandal news: Latest updates on possible Jim Harbaugh suspension from NCAA cheating investigation","context":"## Michigan sign-stealing scandal news: Latest updates on possible Jim Harbaugh suspension from NCAA cheating investigation\n\nOn the field, Michigan is in the midst of what could be a historic season. Off the field, the the focus has rarely been on the team's success.\nAn investigation into Michigan's alleged sign-stealing scheme, centered on now-fired staffer Connor Stalions, continues to evolve by the hour, with one update after another adding another wrinkle to the saga that began in October. The Big Ten suspended coach Jim Harbaugh for three games on Friday with the team on a plane en route to Penn State, and although Michigan had hoped to block the suspension, the Wolverines will be without their coach on the sidelines in Happy Valley.\nThe Sporting News is tracking the latest updates from the Michigan sign-stealing scandal. Follow along with the newest developments below.\nMORE ON MICHIGAN SIGN-STEALING:\nMichigan sign-stealing scandal updates\nFriday, Nov. 17\nMichigan fires coach connected to destroying evidence in investigation\nYahoo Sports' Ross Dellenger and Dan Wetzel reported on Friday that the NCAA's investigation into the sign-stealing and advanced scouting operation has found that Stalions was at least partially funded by a Michigan booster, named as \"Uncle T,\" and that linebackers coach Chris Partridge, who was fired by Michigan on Friday, is alleged to have destroyed evidence on a computer pertaining to the sign-stealing allegations.\nThe report states Partridge is not believed to have had prior knowledge of the sign-stealing operation, but then later worked to cover it up. In a statement on his firing, Michigan appeared to indicate a connection between Partridge and the NCAA's investigation, which Dellenger and Wetzel reported is still in the early stage:\nFrom the outset, our focus has been on seeking due process and allowing the NCAA to conduct a fair and deliberate investigation. Although the Big Ten has closed its investigation, we are continuing to cooperate with the NCAA as it moves forward with its ongoing investigation. Consistent with our commitment to integrity, we will continue to take the appropriate actions, including disciplinary measures, based on information we obtain. Earlier today, Michigan Athletics relieved Chris Partridge of his duties as a member of the Michigan Football staff. Due to employee privacy laws, we are unable to comment further.\"\nBecause Michigan and Harbaugh on Thursday dropped their litigation against the Big Ten, he will not be on Michigan's sideline this week against Maryland and next week against Ohio State to end the regular season.\nFormer Wolverines assistant and Harbaugh confidant Biff Poggi on Friday offered his former boss an invitation. Poggi, in his first year as Charlotte's head coach, asked Harbaugh to join the 49ers for their games vs. Rice on Saturday and at South Florida on Nov. 25.\nI am extending an open invitation to Jim Harbaugh to join me on the sidelines for the next two Charlotte football games. It would be my honor to stand next to you again as we did for three years \u2014 Biff poggi (@BiffPoggi) November 17, 2023\nThursday, Nov. 16\nMichigan accepts Harbaugh's three-game suspension\nMichigan has dropped its litigation against the Big Ten over Harbaugh's three-game suspension, and it will accept the punishment levied against the head coach.\nFrom Michigan:\n\"This morning, the University, Coach Harbaugh, and the Big Ten resolved their pending litigation. The Conference agreed to close its investigation, and the University and Coach Harbaugh agreed to accept the three-game suspension. Coach Harbaugh, with the University's support, decided to accept this sanction to return the focus to our student-athletes and their performance on the field. The Conference has confirmed that it is not aware of any information suggesting Coach Harbaugh's involvement in the allegations. The University continues to cooperate fully with the NCAA's investigation.\nFrom the Big Ten:\n\"The Big Ten Conference's commitment to student-athletes, sportsmanship and the commissioner's duty to protect the integrity of competition will never waver. Today's decision by the University of Michigan to withdraw its legal challenge against the conference's November 10th notice of disciplinary action is indicative of the high standards and values that the conference and the university seek to uphold, the University of Michigan is a valued member of the Big Ten Conference and the conference will continue to work cooperatively with the university and the NCAA during this process.\"\nMonday, Nov. 13\nHarbaugh says he'll state his case at Friday hearing\nDespite the suspension, Jim Harbaugh held his usual weekly news conference Monday, though he mostly avoided addressing the only topic on anyone's mind.\nHe initially told reporters he would speak during a scheduled hearing Friday, but then backtracked a bit and sounded as if he wasn't committed to that course, pending legal advice.\nHarbaugh said he will speak at the hearing on Friday. He said he\u2019s looking for \u201cdue process.\u201d Mentioned a civics class he took 40 years ago. \u201cYou\u2019re innocent until proven guilty. I\u2019d like that opportunity.\u201d \u2014 Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) November 13, 2023\nHarbaugh clarifies that he\u2019s not sure whether he\u2019ll testify Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s not my dance floor,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of shows. I\u2019ve watched Judge Judy a lot.\u201d \u2014 Austin Meek (@byAustinMeek) November 13, 2023\nSunday, Nov. 12\nU-M president praises Wolverines for handling 'challenges and adversity'\nThe day after the Penn State win, University of Michigan President Santa Ono posted on social media, praising the team's ability to \"respond to any challenge head on with a conviction to do better and to emerge even stronger.\"\nCountless members of the University of Michigan family have reached out to me over the weekend and I wanted to express my appreciation. Like any community, we face our share of challenges and adversity. There have been many such moments in our history. But as our team showed so\u2026 \u2014 Santa Ono (@SantaJOno) November 12, 2023\nThe post drew immediate and extensive blowback on social media and beyond, as observers questioned Ono's tone with Michigan in the midst of a self-inflicted controversy.\nSaturday, Nov. 11\nWarde Manuel issues strong statement against Big Ten\nMichigan athletic director Warde Manuel did not mince words in a statement on the Big Ten's suspension of Harbaugh. He said while the program has been disappointed to hear about the allegations, it also feels that the conference skipped due process of a complete investigation in suspending Harbaugh on Friday.\nManuel described the suspension as \"completely unethical\" and \"an assault on the rights of everyone (especially in the Big Ten) to be judged by a fair and complete investigation.\"\n\"All of the Head Coaches in the Big Ten (some who have been accused of actively participating in the trading of signals of opponents) and my Big Ten AD colleagues can rejoice today that someone was 'held accountable,' but they should be worried about the new standard of judgment (without complete investigation) that has been unleashed in this conference,\" Manuel said.\nStatement from Michigan AD Warde Manuel. \u201cI find that completely unethical, insulting to a well-established process within the NCAA, and an assault on the rights of everyone (especially in the Big Ten) to be judged by a fair and complete investigation.\u201d pic.twitter.com\/Qm9iehYVTR \u2014 Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) November 11, 2023\nHarbaugh will not be on the sidelines vs. Penn State\nMichigan filed a temporary restraining order against the Big Ten on Friday night, hoping to block Harbaugh's suspension.

So, why was Harbaugh suspended? The Big Ten asserts that, because he is the head coach, he has a responsibility for preventing this kind of scheme from taking place.\nThe Big Ten is also asserting that they are not actually sanctioning Harbaugh, for whom they have no proof of wrongdoing, but that he \"embodies the university for purposes of its football program.\" pic.twitter.com\/S660G6zQaa \u2014 Stewart Mandel (@slmandel) November 10, 2023\nJim Harbaugh suspended for remainder of regular season\nThe Big Ten has officially announced a suspension for Jim Harbaugh for the remaining three games of the regular season, including the Wolverines' rivalry game with Ohio State.\nIn a statement, the Big Ten said Michigan conducted an \"impermissible, in-person scouting operation over multiple years.\"\nOFFICIAL: Jim Harbaugh suspended for the remaining three regular season games.\n\n\"Michigan has been found in violation of the Big Ten Sportsmanship Policy for conducting an impermissible, in-person scouting operation over multiple years...\" https:\/\/t.co\/htnUkshmnF \u2014 Chris Vannini (@ChrisVannini) November 10, 2023\nJim Harbaugh joins Michigan for trip to State College\nAccording to the sleuths on the ground in Ann Arbor, Harbaugh is on the team bus and heading to the airport with his team as Michigan awaits word on a potential suspension.\nJim Harbaugh boarding the bus pic.twitter.com\/CWBJbwEEhi \u2014 Austin Meek (@byAustinMeek) November 10, 2023\nMichigan still awaiting word from Big Ten\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Rittenberg, Michigan still hasn't heard about an impending punishment from the Big Ten as its 1 p.m. ET flight looms.\nMichigan's administration has not heard from the Big Ten as of this hour, per sources. The team will begin its preparations to leave for Penn State around 1 p.m. ET.

But regardless of when the punishment is announced, Harbaugh's attorney, Tom Mars, reportedly told ESPN the coach will be headed to State College.\n\"I'm confident he's going to be on that plane one way or another,\" Mars reportedly told ESPN.\nJim Harbaugh\u2019s attorney, Tom Mars, tells ESPN he fully expects Jim Harbaugh to fly with the team to Penn State. \u201cI\u2019m confident he\u2019s going to be on that plane one way or another,\" Mars said. \u2014 Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) November 10, 2023\nPunishment options for Michigan\nDinich has reported the punishment could be anything, ranging from \"indefinite suspension to public reprimand or lofty fine.\" However, she also reported that there is potentially a limit to what the conference can do without permission from an executive board. Anything more than two games or a fine of $10,000 would require special permission.\nPlease remember the Big Ten has considered a WIDE range of punishments - everything from indefinite suspension to public reprimand or lofty fine, sources tell me n @ESPNRittenberg \u2026 no assumptions.

ESPN's Heather Dinich reported the punishment is expected to be announced early Friday afternoon. She noted the team is leaving for State College at 1 p.m. CT for the Penn State game on Saturday.\nsources indicate a Big Ten response is coming early this afternoon.

The possibility of a suspension has often garnered most of the headlines, but Rittenberg reported the conference is also considering a significant fine.\nWhile we wait ... although Big Ten has considered a suspension for Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, it is considering a range of possibilities, including a significant fine, sources told @CFBHeather and me. Public reprimands\/fines are common penalties under B1G sportsmanship policy. \u2014 Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) November 9, 2023\nMichigan's 10-page letter to Big Ten released\nYahoo Sports' Dan Wetzel posted Michigan's full 10-page letter to the Big Ten on X (formerly Twitter). The letter outlines Michigan's belief that the Big Ten would be acting too hastily in suspending Harbaugh or levying any punishment toward Michigan before the completion of a full NCAA investigation.\nIn the letter, Michigan said the university has not had the chance to review all the evidence and respond, which oversteps the due process allowed for Michigan. It said Pettiti should not have unilateral authority to punish violations without first having a completed investigation and then a response from the Compliance and Reinstatement Committee, which would recommend penalties for rules violations.\nMichigan noted that regarding evidence, there is nothing it is aware of to claim athletics personnel at Michigan committed the allegations, and said the rule pertaining to electronic recordings of games is limited to the use of field equipment used by the institution for the game it is currently playing. It also said Michigan has not seen much evidence, but rather has just heard a summary of second- and third-hand information.\nThe letter also said given the use of sign decoding by other universities, there is little reason to believe Stalions' efforts proved meaningful, and pointed out the teams' average margin of victory since Stalions was suspended. It said the information obtained is \"at most a reflection of information that teams can and easily do obtain through public and permissible sources,\" and because of that it is \"highly dubious\" that Stalions' observations would have a \"material effect on the integrity of the competition.\"\nHere is Michigan\u2019s 10-page letter to the Big Ten responding to the sportsmanship investigation, reporting with @RossDellenger 1\/3 pic.twitter.com\/P0oYgIbS67 \u2014 Dan Wetzel (@DanWetzel) November 9, 2023\nNo timetable for Big Ten decision\nThe Big Ten is reviewing the \"lengthy\" official response from Michigan and Jim Harbaugh and it's unclear when a potential ruling might come down, says ESPN's Pete Thamel.

He denied them forthright.\n\u201cI can tell you this right now that nobody here did any of that,\u201d Day said, per the Columbus Dispatch. \u201cWe went through and made sure we asked all the questions and got our compliance people involved. None of that came back at all. I can answer very strongly that that did not happen.\u201d\nMichigan submits response to Big Ten\nIn the latest step toward a resolution, Michigan has submitted its response to the Big Ten's notice of discipline. ESPN reported earlier Wednesday that no ruling from the conference is expected until Thursday, as the Big Ten is planning to \"take time to absorb\" what Michigan has to say.\nMichigan has sent its response to the Big Ten, a school official tells ESPN. Commissioner Tony Petitti now must decide how to proceed with potential discipline. \u2014 Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) November 8, 2023\nYahoo Sports obtained a copy of the 10-page letter sent by Michigan to the Big Ten. Within it, the school warned Big Ten commissioner Tony Pettiti against levying \"premature\" disciplinary action against Jim Harbaugh and alleged that in-person scouting and sign-stealing are commonplace across the NCAA.\n\"The conference should act cautiously when setting precedent given the reality that in-person scouting, collusion among opponents, and other questionable practices may well be far more prevalent than believed,\" the letter read.\nMichigan also included with the letter \"two attached documents of Michigan's offensive and defensive signs allegedly stolen and shared by other Big Ten teams,\" per Yahoo Sports.\nConference awaits Michigan response\nThe Big Ten expects a formal response from Michigan to the notice of discipline by the end of the day Wednesday, ESPN's Pete Thamel reports.

The person who supplied the documents told The Athletic he spent 10 to 12 hours per week trying to decode signals based on game video and said the practice of sharing decoded signals with other schools is common.\nHowever, the primary difference is Michigan is accused of using in-person scouting, which has been prohibited under NCAA rules for nearly 30 years, to acquire its information.\nMonday, Nov. 6\nNo connection between Buckeyes coach, Michigan investigation\nOhio State coach Ryan Day and his family have no connection to the Big Ten and NCAA investigations into Michigan, Yahoo Sports reported.\nA report emerged over the weekend indicating Day may have had some involvement in the probe into the Buckeyes' arch-rivals, but the NCAA told the Big Ten there are no ties that it knows of between the Ohio State coach and the investigation.\nNCAA shares findings with Big Ten as Harbaugh suspension looms\nYahoo Sports reported Monday that the NCAA shared its investigation findings with the Big Ten, noting that the findings \"do not connect the in-person scouting and recording of opponents\u2019 sidelines to Harbaugh.\"\nStill, the conference is considering a suspension for Harbaugh and could hand down punishments before the end of the week.\nYahoo says a multi-game suspension for Harbaugh is on the table, though Michigan is fully expected to fight a ban if one is handed down. It would be Harbaugh's second suspension of the season, as the Wolverines self-imposed a three-game ban on Harbaugh to start the season amid an NCAA investigation that found Harbaugh lied to investigators.\nSaturday, Nov. 4\nHarbaugh 'likely' to be suspended\nAccording to The Athletic's Pete Thamel, the Big Ten might be getting closer to handing down a suspension for Harbaugh.\n\"Over the past few days, Petitti has spoken with the athletic directors, he's spoken with the presidents, he's spoken with the coaches. And the next steps appear that there will be some type of punishment for Michigan. The most likely scenario here is some type of suspension for Jim Harbaugh,\" Thamel said on ESPN's \"College GameDay.\"\nMORE: Why Jim Harbaugh won't find refuge in the NFL\nIt was reported earlier in the week that coaches were putting pressure on the Big Ten to hit Michigan with some form of punishment, with Purdue's Ryan Walters publicly calling for action and claiming the allegations are no longer simply allegations.\nHarbaugh was already suspended three games at the start of the season, in a ban imposed by the school itself in an attempt to ward off a separate NCAA investigation.\nFriday, Nov. 3\nSuspended football analyst Connor Stalions resigns\nMichigan football analyst Connor Stalions, the focus of the NCAA's investigation, resigned on Friday night, the university confirmed.\nStatement from Michigan (confirming earlier reports that Connor Stalions is no longer with the program): \"Connor Stalions resigned his position with Michigan Athletics this afternoon. We are unable to comment further regarding this personnel matter.\" \u2014 Jesse Dougherty (@dougherty_jesse) November 4, 2023\nIn a statement, Stalions' lawyer said that his client hoped to avoid creating more distractions for Michigan and denied that any Wolverines staffer \"told anyone to break any rules.\"\nMORE: Who is Connor Stalions?\nStalions is accused of buying numerous tickets to scout future opponents in-person, which is against NCAA rules. The NCAA is also investigating the possibility that Stalions appeared on Central Michigan's sideline in Chippewas gear for a game against Michigan State.\nStalions was suspended by Michigan when the news of his alleged involvement first broke.\n\nThis article, authored by Dan Treacy, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-06 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":180}
{"title":"The fate of US venture capital in China teeters on uncertainty","context":"## The fate of US venture capital in China teeters on uncertainty\n\nFate of US venture capital in China teeters on uncertainty Tech crackdown in China and US scrutiny drive some of these VCs to look abroad\nOn a weekday afternoon at Red Rock Coffee, the caf\u00e9 known for spotting venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, one is likely to overhear a few conversations in Mandarin. With China reopening its borders this spring following three years of COVID-19 restrictions, managers of U.S. funds in the country have been flocking to the Bay Area. While these trips were routine before the pandemic, they have now taken on a fresh purpose of discovering deals beyond China.\nUSD-denominated funds in China have long been drawing inspiration from Silicon Valley startups, using them as benchmarks for investment targets back home. They would seek out the equivalents of Facebook, Amazon and Uber on the other side of the Pacific Ocean and hope they become winners in the country\u2019s largely untapped internet market.\nThis dealmaking strategy of American funds in China has become less effective in the face of shifting global and domestic landscapes. Driven by a confluence of factors, from China\u2019s crackdown on the tech industry to escalating U.S.-China tensions, some of these investors are now turning their gaze to opportunities abroad, tracing the footsteps of a new generation of Chinese-founded startups that are expanding overseas.\nBetween a rock and a hard place\nSince their entry into China in the late 1990s, American venture capital firms, led by powerhouses like Sequoia Capital, IDG Capital and GGV, have played a major role in funding high-risk, high-reward startups in the country\u2019s consumer internet sector. This two-decade-long mutually beneficial relationship, however, now hangs in the balance as changes at home and abroad diminish the pool of investment opportunities for outside financiers.\nIn recent years, Beijing\u2019s sweeping tech crackdowns have introduced a new sense of uncertainty to investors. VCs fear that their portfolio companies might encounter a fate akin to that of Ant Group, whose colossal initial public offering was called off, and Didi, which weathered an extensive data security probe that eventually led to its delisting from New York. With China tightening its grip on overseas IPOs, investors who once relied on taking Chinese firms public in the U.S. are no longer assured of an exit channel.\nIn the meantime, Washington has stepped up restrictions on the flow of U.S. money into China amid an escalating tech war between the two superpowers. In August, President Joe Biden signed an executive order barring U.S. investments in three strategically critical sectors in China \u2014 artificial intelligence, quantum computing and semiconductors.\nAs USD funds in China await further clarity on the scope of the ban, they are practicing more discretion than ever before. They slow down capital deployment even amidst a global AI fervor that has given rise to a parallel AI universe in China. At the same time, domestic RMB funds play an increasing role in funding critical tech sectors. Zhipu AI, one of China\u2019s most ambitious challengers to OpenAI, for instance, raised financing in RMB instead of USD.\nEven having the Chinese branches of famed American VCs listed on the cap table might deter U.S. investors from funding Chinese founders in their backyard. Local investors are now shunning Chinese \u201clinks\u201d, of which definition is ever evolving and broadening, at all costs.\nThe country\u2019s USD investors continue to deploy capital in industries that aren\u2019t in the crosshairs of U.S.-China competition, but overall, their activity has dwindled significantly due to the changing regulatory and geopolitical currents, coupled with a slowing economy. The year 2022 saw just $14.5 billion invested in Chinese companies by U.S.-headquartered VCs, compared to $45.4 billion the year before, according to a report from research firm PitchBook. The number of deals nearly halved to 595, and the share of deals with U.S. investor participation dropped to 18.2% in 2022 after hovering above 30% for half a decade.\nThe scaleback is most notable in prolific investors like Sequoia Capital China, which recently changed its name to HongShan after splitting off its China operation. Despite its proactive move to decouple, Sequoia still faces scrutiny from the U.S. government over its decades of activity in China. For the first three quarters this year, HongShan completed just 47 deals, compared to 99 deals in the same period of 2022, according to Crunchbase data.\nThe reversing turtles\nAs China\u2019s domestic investment appeal wanes, some investors start to look for opportunities beyond its borders. Rather than a complete departure, they are merely following the footsteps of Chinese talent who have already embarked on global expansion. (We\u2019ve covered the topic extensively here and here.)\nChinese startups have a long history of going abroad, and every wave has assumed its own approach. Previously, many companies would venture out only after succeeding in China. These days, more are eyeing global expansion from day one, sometimes even skipping their home market.\nMany in the current generation of globalizing Chinese founders have studied or worked overseas. Captivated by the Chinese internet\u2019s rapid growth, they returned home in the late 2010s to join the likes of Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba and ByteDance. Having gained an insider\u2019s look into Chinese tech titans, they set out on their own entrepreneurial journey with the hope of becoming the next Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba.\nIn China, they are called haigui, or those who \u201creturn from overseas,\u201d a homophone of \u201csea turtles.\u201d Their dreams started to crumple following the fall from grace of Ma, whose Ant Group and Alibaba became prominent targets of China\u2019s tech crackdown. They soon realized that China had entered a new era, where the regulatory hurdles for running a startup have significantly heightened.\nThe year 2022 saw just $14.5 billion invested in Chinese companies by U.S.-headquartered VCs, compared to $45.4 billion the year before.\nTo launch an AI service in China, for example, a company needs to navigate a multitude of complications, which can include obtaining a license for its large language model, seeking regulatory approval for its algorithms and implementing a costly censorship mechanism to comply with censorship requirements.\n\u201cYou need to pick sides. You either focus on China or go overseas, otherwise, you end up doing double the workload but with a lot less funding secured from the last two years,\u201d said one of the five China-based VCs we interviewed for the story. We also spoke to six diaspora Chinese entrepreneurs. Due to the sensitivity of the topic, all of them have asked to remain anonymous.\nSome ambitious, well-funded AI startups want to target both sides. To that end, they would create two entities each tailored to the Chinese and non-Chinese markets while raising capital in USD and RMB separately.\nNot every startup has the resources to pursue a dual-market strategy, so many \u201csea turtles\u201d wound up leaving China again. While foreign markets present their own sets of challenges \u2014 competition and skepticism toward outsiders \u2014 these entrepreneurs perceive a broader, more predictable opportunity in AI in the West. This reversal of their trajectory has earned them the moniker, guihai, or those who \u201creturn overseas.\u201d\nFollowing the turtles\nAt home, the Western-educated and -trained Chinese entrepreneurs are darlings of local VCs. In Silicon Valley, they are little known to investors. Occasional media reports that stress their Chinese background further erode trust in potential investors and customers at a time when concerns about national security already run high.\nEven having the Chinese branches of famed American VCs listed on the cap table might deter U.S. investors from funding Chinese founders in their backyard, three founders said. Local investors are now shunning Chinese \u201clinks,\u201d of which definition is ever evolving and broadening, at all costs to avoid geopolitical risks.\n\u201cIf you speak like a local, know how to pitch like a confident Silicon Valley founder, have not taken any money from Chinese VCs, have all your staff in the U.S., have generated good traction in the local market, and are working on getting a green card, you might get a chance to raise local money,\u201d said a Chinese founder based in San Francisco. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it if you still run your R&D out of China.\u201d\nThis financing gap presents an opportunity for the USD fund managers who are hunting beyond China\u2019s borders. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot easier to raise their first round from China\u2019s USD funds,\u201d said a former investor at one of China\u2019s top VC firms. \u201cIn some sense, the entrepreneurs are taking these investors on an international expedition.\u201d\nVC activity with U.S. participation in China during 2023 will hit a nine-year low, followed by a decade low in 2024.\nBesides the low-hanging fruit of the diaspora community, Chinese VCs flying in from Beijing and Shanghai have limited avenues to source deals in the U.S. American startups are courted by a plethora of local investors, let alone the geopolitical risks of accepting Chinese-managed money. These parachuting investors also run into competition from local investors already tailored to U.S.-China cross-border opportunities, most famously UpHonest Capital.\n\u201cVCs thrive on information arbitrage. In the U.S., we don\u2019t really have that same extensive network as at home,\u201d said an investor from the China arm of a global VC firm who now spends a third of their time abroad.\nA transitory phase\nVenturing out of China is not a \u201cpivot\u201d for the USD fund managers, said one of the investors we spoke to. Rather, the partners and their associates are mostly looking for something to get their hands on in the midst of a tepid market. Some are contemplating a career change, but it\u2019s difficult to find any job that matches their enviable pay.\n\u201cChinese VCs are most anxious about the U.S. building cars behind closed doors. They don\u2019t want to fall behind, especially given the speed AI is evolving, so they are going to the Bay Area to figure it out themselves,\u201d the investor added.\nThe recent influx of Chinese VCs into the Bay Area should also be viewed in a broader context. Many of these investors, who have family ties in the U.S., have been going stateside regularly for years. COVID-19, which shut down trans-Pacific flights and introduced costly and harsh quarantines, created a pent-up demand for travel. Naturally, many investors rushed to the Bay Area as soon as the borders reopened, but the surge in activity might soon start to subside, said a partner who spent the past summer in California.\nThere are no signs that USD funds\u2019 dealmaking in China will bounce back to its heights in the foreseeable future. The PitchBook report predicts that VC activity with U.S. participation in China during 2023 will hit a nine-year low, followed by a decade low in 2024. Many Chinese general partners have already been sourcing capital from the Middle East, which might eventually limit the impact of U.S. investors\u2019 pullback. But the question is whether Chinese tech firms, now under a new stringent regulatory regime, can deliver the same level of strong growth and returns they experienced in the previous laissez-faire era.\nIf the U.S. market turns out to be too challenging to penetrate due to competitive and geopolitical factors, there are still other markets to explore. Japan, known for its openness to new technologies, has been particularly popular among China\u2019s SaaS startups venturing abroad. Sniffing opportunity, China\u2019s USD fund managers, still anchored in the Middle Kingdom, will likely follow them to the neighboring country or any other market that will help hedge against uncertainties presented at home and abroad.\n\nThis article, authored by Rita Liao, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-25 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":181}
{"title":"Japan\u2019s prime minister Kishida says: \u2018reassess our economy\u2019","context":"## Japan\u2019s prime minister Kishida says: \u2018reassess our economy\u2019\n\nThroughout September, in Tokyo, New York, Hong Kong and London, the world\u2019s biggest investment banks hosted a series of conferences for the world\u2019s biggest investors, all gravitating around the same theme: is Japan really back?\nAnd, according to both the attendees and hosts of those events \u2014 which were run by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Mizuho, BNP Paribas, and Jefferies \u2014 the answer is now clearer than it has been in a very long time. Japan is back, but global investors may take a little more persuasion that it is truly back for the duration.\nSo, this week, prime minister Fumio Kishida will make his strongest ever push for a bet on Asia\u2019s biggest advanced economy \u2014 as BlackRock founder Larry Fink, and other heads of global funds, gather in Tokyo for a series of events to attract investment.\n\u201cI would urge you to evaluate what we are doing in my country, look at the underlying strength of our economy and our plans for the future and then invest in Japan,\u201d Kishida said in a recent speech at the Economic Club of New York.\nOn the face of it, the Tokyo conference guests have been told by various experts that the stars do appear aligned in Japan\u2019s favour, both on its own merits and in comparison with what is happening around it. But, because so many global funds have diverted expertise away from Japan in recent years, they are concerned that they need to know more, as a matter of urgency.\n\u201cThere is heightened interest in Japan after what has been, for many, a long period of not being focused on that country,\u201d says Paul Hitchens, the head of the Japan research department at Jefferies, which hosted a major investor conference in Hong Kong.\nJapanese prime minister Fumio Kishida will appear this week at a series of events aimed at attracting foreign investment \u00a9 AFP via Getty Images\nThere are distinctive catalysts for that, he adds \u2014 noting a recent push by the Tokyo Stock Exchange for companies to improve their capital efficiency, and the high profile decision of Warren Buffett to invest heavily in five of Japan\u2019s largest trading houses.\nHitchens says: \u201cIs there some healthy scepticism? Yes. However, global investment firms know that they need to invest and build their offerings in Japan to meet the growing appetite, and that they need to pay attention to an equity market at a 33-year high.\u201d\nTopix, Japan\u2019s main stock index, has risen more than 25 per cent this year, outperforming almost all the world\u2019s developed market indices and, as some conference attendees admit, creating a \u201cfear of missing out\u201d on a rally that may have significantly further to go.\nLarge global funds are not the only ones to have had their interest in Japan piqued, says Keith Truelove, head of global markets at UBS Securities Japan.\n\u201cThere is still a lot of dry powder on the sidelines,\u201d he observes. \u201cThere is a lot of interest in Japan from family offices and from high net worth individual investors, who value wealth preservation more highly than institutional investors \u2014 it\u2019s really taking off now.\u201d\n\u201cThey took their time to decide if it was safe to invest in Japan again, because they need to get confidence in the idea that the Japan story will be more sustainable this time,\u201d Truelove adds. He notes that Japan has offered investors a number of false-dawns over the years, and the bar for deciding that \u2018this time is different\u2019 remains high.\nOne of the most significant changes, say asset managers, is the fundamental shift in the way global funds now look at China. The geopolitics of US-China tensions, chip wars, decoupling and \u201cfriendshoring\u201d seem, in particular, to be working significantly in Japan\u2019s favour. Asia-focused global investment is rotating out of China and into Tokyo stocks, real estate and other assets, just as large parts of corporate Japan are engaging more actively with shareholders than at any time in the past.\nChina, after years of stunning growth and investor attention, is very rapidly losing that sheen. Its economy is growing more slowly and the expected post-pandemic rebound is proving elusive. On top of that, Beijing\u2019s policymaking \u2014 with its sudden crackdowns on entire industries, like video games and private tutoring, has generated a series of nasty surprises \u2014 and the unshakeable fear that others could occur at any time.\n\u201cYou are seeing more interest in Japan from investors, who were primarily invested in China, as China has slowed and some of its economic policies have been confusing and opaque,\u201d says Kirk Neureiter, president of Fidelity Management & Research Japan. \u201cDeployment of capital to China has been a bit more risky in terms of eventual outcome of investment decisions, given that lack of clarity.\u201d But interest in Japan has not only come about because of the push away from China, he adds.\nJapanese companies are increasingly aligning themselves with the interests of shareholders in a way that once seemed unlikely. Part of that, he says, is generational. Companies that replace their chief executive on five or seven year cycles now have leaders that reached their positions after the establishment of Japan\u2019s stewardship code (in 2014) and corporate governance code (2015). Many have a very different view of the role of a chief executive than their predecessors did.\n\u201cI think that Japan, in terms of the unifying message that companies and the Tokyo Stock Exchange are sending out, now gives a lot more confidence about where they are deploying capital,\u201d says Neureiter. \u201cSo people looking at the region are finding Japan incrementally more attractive. I\u2019ve never seen such a consensus around what needs to be done for Japanese companies to improve capital efficiency and returns on capital,\u201d he adds.\nEfforts by Japanese businesses to demonstrate better governance are aided by government initiatives to make Tokyo more attractive for foreign asset managers. Kishida has promised major reform of the country\u2019s $5tn asset management industry, which would ease regulations that had made it difficult for foreign and new players to enter.\nThe government plans to expand the Nippon Individual Savings Account (Nisa) tax-free investment scheme from next year in a bid to unlock $14tn in household financial assets that has long sat in cash and bank deposits.\n\u201cThis is completely different from before,\u201d says Stefanie Drews, president of Nikko Asset Management. \u201cIn the past, allocation to Japan had been tactical but this time it is strategic and that is why it is much more meaningful.\u201d\n\nThis article was published by Financial Times on 2023-10-01 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":182}
{"title":"Thursday Night Football FanDuel Picks: NFL DFS lineup advice for Week 4 Lions-Packers single-game tournaments","context":"## Thursday Night Football FanDuel Picks: NFL DFS lineup advice for Week 4 Lions-Packers single-game tournaments\n\nFor Detroit, it's all about courage. For a team that was once down and out, much like their city, they are now once again on the rise. The Lions are supposed to be the kings of the jungle and hope to become the NFL's version in 2023. In terms of the food chain, a basic concept taught in science classes across the country, lions are the hunter rather than the hunted, but it's been the other way around for far too long, as 31 other teams have feasted on a once proud franchise.\nTheir motors have been restored and the team has been rebuilt with an attitude and moxie that would make even the most \"football guy\" of \"football guys\" blush. It's a combination of quiet confidence and a downright arrogant confidence that draws people in to root for -- or against -- an underdog.\nWhile the Packers have packed up the Lions for years, that all began to change in 2022. Aaron Rodgers is no longer in Green Bay, and a new love interest is now under center, Jordan Love. It was these Lions that ended the Rodgers era and swept Green Bay last season. Now they meet again in prime time on one of the league's most hallowed grounds in a battle for NFC North supremacy. The tundra won't be frozen at Lambeau Field at this point in the season, but the game sure is important, and for a game like this, there's no way we could pass up the chance to win some cash with our FanDuel single-game DFS lineup.\nMORE THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL:\nDK lineup | Best props | Betting preview | Start-Sit\nBefore we break down our picks and strategy, here are the most notable scoring rules for FanDuel contests: four-point passing TDs and half-point PPR.\nTNF INJURY UPDATES: Montgomery | Jones | Watson\nLions-Packers FanDuel Picks Week 4: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments\nLions-Packers TNF, $60,000 budget\nMVP (1.5x points) QB Jared Goff, Lions ($15,500). The Lions might not be the Super Bowl contenders we thought they could be, but that doesn't mean we aren't in for a treat on Thursday night at Lambeau Field. Detroit is finding its footing in 2023 and should be able to have some success against the Packers. On the surface, Green Bay's pass defense is playing around league average, allowing 207.3 passing yards per game. That slots them in at No. 18, while Pro Football Focus grades them the No. 8 team in coverage with an 81.5. Let's look beneath the surface a little more. The Packers' first three games have come against the No. 15, 29, and 31 ranked teams in passing yards per game, or the No. 21, 29, and 32 passing offenses as graded by PFF. The Lions love to throw and have a quarterback that rarely turns it over. Goff should be in position for a solid night with his arm, lighting it up through the air against a defense that might be without their star corner, Jaire Alexander (back), again in Week 4.\nFLEX QB Jordan Love, Packers ($16,000). From one quarterback to another, we like this game to feature a lot of points. It's something that doesn't happen often on \"Thursday Night Football,\" but that should change this week. The Lions seem incapable of playing in low-scoring, grind-it-out games, so there will be chances for Love to get the Packers on the scoreboard often. He has seven passing touchdowns through the first three weeks and faces a bottom-10 passing defense, per PFF. Love will enjoy a date with Detroit's banged-up secondary that is just beginning life without C.J. Gardner-Johnson (pec).\nFLEX WR Romeo Doubs ($10,500). Christian Watson appears primed for a return on Thursday night, but does it really matter? With him being held out for multiple weeks with a hamstring injury, we question the type of workload that the former North Dakota State standout is in line for. As a result, we look to Doubs. The second-year receiver is tied for the team lead in targets and has the most touchdowns with three. Along with Jayden Reed, Doubs has been a favorite of Love's in the red zone, as the duo has combined for 12-of-16 targets to receivers. As Watson eases his way back in, it's not like Doubs will fall off a cliff in terms of production. He remains relevant with that type of connection forming.\nFLEX TE Sam LaPorta, Lions ($10,000). Rookie tight ends aren't typically fantasy-relevant right away, but that's where LaPorta finds himself, becoming a favorite target of Goff. He's been on an upward trajectory, starting with five targets in Week 1, six in Week 2, and 11 in Week 3. He's totaled 39, 63, and 84 yards, respectively, in those games, scoring a touchdown in the most recent contest. The Packers are a middle-of-the-road group against tight ends, but they still haven't faced one in a passing offense that lives up to LaPorta's level. On a short week with some banged-up players on offense, LaPorta should be a heavily involved security blanket.\nFLEX TE, Luke Musgrave ($8,000). Much like with the quarterbacks, we also like the other tight end in this game. Musgrave is coming off his best game of the season, hauling in six catches for 49 yards, and he gets a matchup against the second-worst defense against tight ends. According to FantasyPros, the Lions are giving up 14.8 fantasy points per game to the position, leaving Musgrave in a great spot to deliver. If Watson does return on Thursday, it could help the rookie, as Detroit's defense will have to focus their attention elsewhere.\nBest SuperDraft NFL DFS Picks for Lions-Packers\nThis year, we're also listing our favorite weekly DFS plays on SuperDraft.\nFor those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.\nMORE: Win BIG with SuperDraft!

This week is all about offense. The Lions feature a potent offense that's three-headed monster of Goff, St. Brown, and Gibbs should be able to produce. On the Green Bay side of things, Love will hopefully have his top option back in the backfield and that duo cooked the Bears defense in the opener. If Jones is healthy and suits up, then he's a must-have in your roster after the clunkers that AJ Dillon has posted for the last two weeks. Otherwise, pivot to a pass-catcher.\n\nThis article, authored by Nick Brinkerhoff, was published by Sporting News on 2023-09-26 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":183}
{"title":"England thrash Scotland but cannot avoid Team GB Olympic heartbreak","context":"## England thrash Scotland but cannot avoid Team GB Olympic heartbreak\n\nAn anxious wait, then complete heartbreak. No one could question the effort, the heart or the drive of Sarina Wiegman\u2019s Lionesses in this game, but scoring six goals against Scotland was not enough to close the goal difference gap on the Netherlands, because the Dutch scored a fourth against Belgium deep in added time to secure top spot and progress from their Nations League group ahead of England.\nIt was an extraordinary mountain and a Lauren James masterclass and gut-busting display from Lucy Bronze were not enough to lift them to the summit. The damage had been done in the preceding games, two poor goals conceded against the Dutch at Wembley, a 3-2 defeat in Belgium in October and a 2-1 loss to the Netherlands in September, will be full of regrets. However, there will be what\u2011ifs either way, the first goal conceded in Utrecht appearing offside in the buildup.\nIt meant a back and forth of goals scored by England against Scotland and the Netherlands in their win over Belgium was necessary in the final round of fixtures. A showdown.\nThere will be questions about Scotland\u2019s efforts, a defensive collapse at Hampden Park almost helping England towards earning a place for Team GB at the Paris Olympics, but that would be unfair. The gulf in class between the European champions, ranked fourth in the world, and their neighbours to the north, ranked 23rd, is clear and the manager, Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa, has been unconvincing in charge.\nThere were two changes to the England side that came from two goals down to earn Friday\u2019s late 3-2 win against the Netherlands that had kept hopes of progression alive. Beth Mead was returned to the starting lineup for the first time since suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury just over a year ago, having proved her worth coming off the bench at half-time against the Dutch to insert some directness into England\u2019s play, and Esme Morgan replaced Jess Carter.\nMart\u00ednez Losa swapped four players from the side that earned a 1-1 draw with Belgium on Friday, with Lee Alexander notably replacing the former England international Sandy MacIver in goal.\nLauren James scores England\u2019s third goal in their emphatic win. Photograph: Carl Recine\/Reuters\nWiegman had urged her players to \u201cgo wild from the first minute\u201d against Scotland, cautioning \u201cbut you don\u2019t want to get erratic\u201d and England came out of the blocks searching for an early goal that would assert their authority on the tie. If there was any doubt about Scotland\u2019s intentions against England, with Bronze calling accusations that Scotland players might feel conflicted with the possibility of Olympic qualification on the line for them as much as for England \u201cthe rudest thing I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d and Scotland\u2019s captain, Rachel Corsie, calling it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d those were put to bed, temporarily at least, in the opening three minutes, with Bronze clattered into late twice as Scotland looked to make an early impression.\nIf England had played well for the opening 10 minutes against the Dutch only to be sucker-punched on the counter in the 12th minute, against Scotland there was no risk of that. Instead, the visiting team took the lead to swing the pressure on to the Dutch, Mead\u2019s corner sent in by an unmarked Greenwood.\nMoments later Lisa Evans was down in the box under pressure from Bronze but appeals for a penalty were waved away with the right-back having not caught the forwards legs.\nThat rare foray forward was urged on by a vocal Scotland crowd, in which interesting conversations could be heard. After Lauren Hemp raced free on the right a hopeful \u201cCome on Lauren\u201d was met with a thick, cheery Scottish \u201cShut up!\u201d behind the press box.\nIf it was friendly in the stands it was far less so on the pitch. England went close to a second, with the Dutch having taken the lead against Belgium, when James weaved into the box before delivering to Hemp at the far post who lashed her effort off the base of a post from close range.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women\u2019s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mead\u2019s corner was cleared and sent back in by the Arsenal forward only to be cleared again. But while England players appealed for handball, James sent the ball goalward and it took a heavy deflection that wrongfooted Alexander and flew in.\nIt wasn\u2019t pretty, but England were clawing away at the goal difference gap. A minute later James delivered in more characteristic style, curling a wonderful effort into the top corner from the edge of the area.\nIn added time at the end of the half, James turned provider of the goal that put England top of the group once more, sweeping a cross to Mead at the far post for the forward to bring down and fire past a helpless Alexander.\nThe goal that gave England a cushion came shortly after the restart, Georgia Stanway beating Corsie to the byline before sending the ball into the middle for Fran Kirby to turn in from close range. The breathing room didn\u2019t last long, though, with the Netherlands scoring once more.\nThere was almost disaster for England when Earps failed to collect from the feet of Kirsty Hanson, but the Scotland forward sent her effort wide of the empty net with the angle closing.\nAn added-time save of a header from the substitute Martha Thomas at full stretch by Mary Earps kept England in it. The Netherlands having scored in the 91st minute, Bronze\u2019s powering header meant England were back in for two minutes, until they were out, the Dutch scoring in the 95th minute to crush the Lionesses while they stood in a huddle waiting for news of the other game\u2019s result, the pain sweeping across their faces as it came through.\n\nThis article, authored by Suzanne Wrack at Hampden Park, was published by The Guardian on 2023-12-05 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":184}

We\u2019re going to keep this post updated with the most recent series on each of the major streaming platforms that we liked, as well as some other options if our pick doesn\u2019t sound like your particular jam.\nSo, below, find the best new shows on Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Max, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, Apple TV, and Peacock. Our latest update added Castlevania: Nocturne, Gen V, Hijack, and The Continental.\nThe best new shows on Netflix\nCastlevania: Nocturne\nCreator: Clive Bradley\nCast: Edward Bluemel, Thuso Mbedu, Pixie Davies\nTo say that the follow-up to Netflix\u2019s Castlevania had a lot to live up to would be an understatement. Based on Konami\u2019s acclaimed action-adventure game series and produced by Texas-based Powerhouse Animation Studios, the original 32-episode adult animated series was an unmistakable success for the streamer when it premiered in 2017. Chronicling the adventures of Trevor Belmont, the last surviving descendant of a long line of monster hunters, and Sypha, a powerful magic wielder hailing from a reclusive tribe of magicians, the series followed the pair as they joined forces with Alucard, half-human son of Dracula, to slay his vengeful father and save humanity from the threat of extinction.\nCastlevania: Nocturne picks up three centuries after the original, and while Trevor and Sypha may be dead, their legacy lives on in the series\u2019 new protagonist, Richter Belmont. Set amid the French Revolution, Nocturne follows Richter as he is enlisted by a young sorceress named Annette to fight against a conspiracy of aristocrats who have allied themselves with a powerful enemy known as the Vampire Messiah. Haunted by the death of his mother at the hands of a mysterious vampire named Olrox, Richter must call upon every ounce of his courage to face this new darkness and assume his birthright as a Belmont. Castlevania: Nocturne is a terrific installment in the franchise that meets and exceeds the original Castlevania at its best. From its brilliantly realized character designs and exhilarating action sequences to its beautiful score and nuanced take on real-life revolutions, the series is both an excellent continuation and fantastic entry point for new audiences. \u2014Toussaint Egan\nAlso good: The Diplomat, a light, plot-heavy political thriller starring Keri Russell; The Night Agent, a fun popcorn spy thriller from The Shield\u2019s Shawn Ryan; Physical 100, a brilliant and brutal competition show; Ganglands, a visceral French crime thriller; Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the anime from CD Projekt Red and Studio Trigger; The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House, a food-centric drama from master filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda; Derry Girls, the hilarious comedy set against the backdrop of the Troubles; and The Sandman, the live-action adaptation of the DC Comics fantasy horror series by Neil Gaiman.\nThe best new show on Hulu\nReservation Dogs\nCreator: Sterlin Harjo\nCast: Devery Jacobs, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Lane Factor\nReservation Dogs was a wonderful thing \u2014 a show about misfits living on a reservation in Oklahoma who want nothing more than to get far the hell away\u2026 until that far-the-hell-away becomes actually tangible. While Taika Waititi produces the show, it is blissfully removed from his particular (and for me, very tiring) brand of humor, instead shining through award-winning filmmaker Sterlin Harjo and a dynamic cast of main characters and featured guests (the second season included a memorable guest appearance by Prey star Amber Midthunder, and the legendary Gary Farmer and Wes Studi have hilarious recurring roles). The third season wrapped the show up on its terms, leaving an indelible mark on television and the culture at large. \u2014PV\nAlso good: Love Island UK, the reality dating show, What We Do in the Shadows, the hilarious TV adaptation of the modern-day vampire mockumentary, and the final season of Atlanta, the \u201cTwin Peaks for rappers\u201d comedy drama starring (and created by) Donald Glover.\nThe best new TV on Prime Video\nGen V\nShowrunners: Michele Fazekas, Tara Butters\nCast: Jaz Sinclair, Chance Perdomo, Lizze Broadway\nBecoming a superhero is hard. This is an established principle \u2014 those origin stories aren\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows! \u2014 but it\u2019s doubly true in the universe of The Boys, where Gen V takes place. This is a world where your powers manifest with your first period and then kill your mom, as happened to Marie (Jaz Sinclair). She eventually winds up at Godolkin University, the only university for supes in particular, and \u2014 well, it\u2019s the land of Vought International and The Boys. Trouble ensues from there.\nWhat makes Gen V so compelling is how deftly it weaves together its themes. The (latest) conspiracy smoothly brings Marie and her cohort together, leapfrogging tropes and letting the story flow. Gen V manages to do the impossible: Make superhero TV feel like more than a collection of origin story tropes, and let its characters feel very grounded and like people. It\u2019s The Boys, so you know you\u2019re in for a giant dick or a puppet massacre, but it\u2019s worth that buy-in to see just how well Gen V makes its grade. \u2014Zosha Millman\nAlso good: A League of Their Own, an adaptation of the sports movie classic unfortunately canceled after just one season; Paper Girls, a sci-fi coming-of-age comic adaptation also unfortunately canceled after one season; and Reacher, a detective series that asks the important question, \u201cWhat if Sherlock Holmes was absolutely massive?\u201d\nThe best new TV on Max\nUnicorn: Warriors Eternal\nCreators: Genndy Tartakovsky, Darrick Bachman\nCast: Hazel Doupe, Demari Hunte, Tom Milligan, Paul Tylak\nGenndy Tartakovsky is a name that needs no introduction among animation fans. The creator of such well-known and beloved series as Dexter\u2019s Laboratory, Samurai Jack, Primal, and more, Tartakovsky is known for his imaginative worlds populated with eccentric and memorable characters. Unicorn: Warriors Eternal is the director-animator\u2019s latest masterpiece; a fantasy action series over two decades in the making that follows a group of immortal heroes who are reincarnated across time and space to do battle against an ancient evil. The series combines several of Tartakovsky\u2019s most passionate interests \u2014 the science-fiction of Osamu Tezuka\u2019s Astro Boy, the steampunk-adjacent Victorian settings of Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s work, the idiosyncratic character designs of Popeye creator E. C. Segar \u2014 to create an experience that feels unlike anything else on television in 2023, animated or otherwise. \u2014Toussaint Egan\nAlso good: My Adventures with Superman, the slice-of-life action series based on the DC Comics superhero, Full Circle, Stephen Soderbergh\u2019s miniseries loosely based on Akira Kurosawa\u2019s High and Low, Danny McBride\u2019s rapturously funny The Righteous Gemstones, and Harley Quinn, which is currently airing its fourth season.\nThe best new TV on Disney Plus\nAndor\nCreator: Tony Gilroy\nCast: Diego Luna, Kyle Soller, Adria Arjona\nAside from being one of the best Star Wars shows to date, Andor has the enviable distinction of holding the No. 1 spot on our list of the best shows of 2022. Either of those two facts alone warrants the show\u2019s inclusion on this list, but combined, that well-earned place feels all but mandatory. Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) returns to the Star Wars after his turn as co-screenwriter on 2016\u2019s Rogue One, diving into an origin story of the eponymous Rebel captain that also functions as an origin story of the Rebel Alliance itself. The series meticulously moves away from the rote, Easter egg-laden iconography for which many Star Wars fans typically associate the franchise with and substitutes it with down-to-earth aesthetic and tone that treats the stakes of its universe as seriously as the underdogs who occupy it.\nDiego Luna, much like his character, Cassian Andor, is the perfect leading man for the job, while Stellan S\u200b\u200bkarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s supporting performance as the cunning rebellion ringleader Luthen Rael has quickly asserted itself as one of the best characters to come out of Star Wars since Disney acquired the property in 2012. It takes three or so episodes to shift into full gear, but once it does, it\u2019s a exhilarating journey you\u2019ll want to see through to the end. \u2014Toussaint Egan\nAlso good: Willow, the TV revival of the 1988 fantasy adventure.\nThe best new TV on Paramount Plus\nThe Good Fight\nCreators: Robert and Michelle King\nCast: Christine Baranski, Audra McDonald, a rotating cast of your favorite actors on TV\nOne of the initial promises of streaming television was that it would bring us the kind of shows that were not possible on more traditional broadcast or cable networks. In practice, this hasn\u2019t actually amounted to much more than bloated episode length and the occasional one-off experiment, like Arrested Development season 4 or Netflix\u2019s choose-your-own heist show Kaleidoscope.\nThe Good Fight, however, was different. The show opened its first season in 2017 with a very clear mission statement, as Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), a character from series predecessor The Good Wife, prepares to leave her cushy job as partner at a law firm to become a fashionable expat in Italy after the election of Donald Trump. Unfortunately for her, she loses her nest egg when her money is tied up in a Ponzi scheme, and is forced to go back to work \u2014 not at her old, majority-white firm, but at Chicago\u2019s largest Black law firm.\nWith this setup, The Good Fight endeavored to tell the story of Trump-era America as it was written, and while it had its blind spots, it often did a better job of it than most cable news networks, telling unflinching stories about race in America, right-wing internet trolls, and the outrage economy that drives culture wars. But it was also one of the most inventive shows on television \u2014 any given episode could have animated musical segments explaining geopolitics, stories about a secret court that Mandy Patinkin runs like a game show, or a cutaway gag ruminating on whether or not Jeffrey Epstein had his penis frozen for preservation. In this, it was the Star Trek of legal dramas, always different, full of ideas, and gloriously messy. \u2014Joshua Rivera\nAlso good: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, the best of a stellar crop of new Star Trek shows.\nThe best new TV on Apple TV Plus\nHijack\nCreators: George Kay, Jim Field Smith\nCast: Idris Elba, Neil Maskell, Archie Panjabi\nHijack is almost exactly what it sounds like: It\u2019s about a hijacking. But that simplicity of premise belies a much richer, much more fun story, something that reads much more like a breezy blockbuster thriller of yore than another drop in the streaming TV bucket. Comparing TV to movies can be seen as derogatory, suggesting a show lacks the pacing of quality television, but here it just serves to highlight how effectively Hijack is doing what it\u2019s doing. This is a show that knows what it\u2019s about.\nAs does Sam Nelson (Idris Elba), one of the many passengers just trying to make it home when his plane gets suddenly hijacked by a group of terrorists. Without arousing suspicion from the gunmen closely watching the plane, Sam and his fellow travelers have to figure out how to secure the plane and get everyone home safely.\nHijack is taut, making every moment count, even in ways you don\u2019t expect. Little details that feel brushed past are returned to, and things that first seem like plot holes get filled in, exploited by the passengers or the hijackers. And it\u2019s told in close to real time, with every minute and every decision made by those on the plane (and on the ground, as British law enforcement mobilizes to help on their end). It\u2019s twisty, it\u2019s neat, and it involves Idris Elba ducking around a plane \u2014 something Elba said he had to really do, since he is very tall and they filmed in an actual plane. In a world drowning in watchlists that grow larger by the day, Hijack is a breath of fresh air: easy, competent, and just a pure pleasure. \u2014ZM\nAlso good: Severance, a stark science fiction take on the modern workplace; Slow Horses, a British spy drama about a bunch of losers (including Gary Oldman) who would like a win.\nThe best new TV on Peacock\nThe Continental: From the World of John Wick\nCreators: Greg Coolidge, Kirk Ward, Shawn Simmons\nCast: Colin Woodell, Mishel Prada, Hubert Point-Du Jour\nI entered The Continental warily. The world of John Wick didn\u2019t exactly need a prequel series, and it was hard to imagine a television show could come anywhere close to matching the exhilarating highs of the movies\u2019 action sequences.\nBut early on, one thing gave me hope: The hiring of action legend Larnell Stovall to lead the show\u2019s fight sequences. And boy, did Stovall and his team deliver: From the show\u2019s opening heist sequence to the incredible rooftop fight in the third episode, The Continental delivers reliable bangers throughout its three-episode run. The show smartly avoids becoming too loyal to the movies\u2019 visual style \u2014 something the miniseries could never accurately mimic on a more limited budget. Instead, The Continental leans into action appropriate for the era it is set in, and builds surprisingly strong characters and relationships in our brief time at the hotel. \u2014PV\nAlso good: Poker Face, Rian Johnson\u2019s inverted detective series starring Natasha Lyonne; Grand Crew, a sitcom about Black wine aficionados; Girls5Eva, a hilarious comedy about a girl group getting back together; The Resort, a dark mystery-comedy starring William Jackson Harper (The Good Place) and Cristin Milioti (Made for Love) as a couple on vacation who stumble across a deadly mystery.\n\nThis article, authored by Toussaint Egan, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-25 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":185}
{"title":"NASCAR Might Have Just Saved Themselves With the $7.7 Billion Media Rights Deal","context":"## NASCAR Might Have Just Saved Themselves With the $7.7 Billion Media Rights Deal\n\nOct 8, 2023; Concord, North Carolina, USA; Cars crowd into turn four after a restart during the Bank of America Roval 400 at Charlotte Motor Speedway Road Course. Mandatory Credit: Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports\nThere is no denying how the new media rights deal has stunned the NASCAR community. With many still trying to digest it, the deal has undoubtedly given rise to divided opinions. While the figure of $7.7 billion sounds lucrative, there seems to be more to it than what meets the eye.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nIt is public knowledge that NASCAR officials invested plenty of time in negotiating the media rights deal. To secure an average annual revenue of $1.1 billion is something, especially when the sport is supposedly on the wane. However, it looks like the sanctioning body has made it count when it mattered the most.\nIs the new media rights deal a game-changer for NASCAR?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nJust a couple of days back, NASCAR finalized a $7.7 billion deal with Fox Sports, NBC, Amazon, and Warner Bros. Discovery. With such a lucrative deal securing seven years of revenue, surely it seems like a lot of money. But is that really the case?\nNASCAR secured almost a 40% increase over their current media rights deal yet there\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t fit perfectly. Sports Business Journal journalist Adam Stern recently cleared a few things out when he attended the Dirty Mo Live podcast. With the Cup Series already facing a 5% drop in viewership this year, Stern discussed how the new deal could impact the ratings.\nAt first, the renowned journalist explained how the sanctioning body would have loved to stay with Fox Sports and NBC. However, given that it would have most likely resulted in less money, NASCAR opted to explore other options. Stern then pointed out how the media rights revenue plays a key role in sports as he used the MLS as an example.\nHe said, \u201cYou look at MLS. MLS takes a big deal with Apple, almost all of their games behind the Apple TV\u2019s paywall. That was the money they could get and they had to deliver for their industry. Their industry is expected to be a growing business and one of the most sporting ways to be a growing business in sports is to have growing media rights revenue.\u201d\nWhile he explained that it was a similar case with NASCAR, he added one more angle because of which this deal possibly materialized. It is no secret that the cable universe has been declining. As Stern discussed, every quarter, there is a drop in a couple of percentages of subscribers, which is very concerning.\nThis is one of the reasons why NASCAR did not want to gamble solely on cable users. With Amazon Prime, they had the leisure to explore the streaming arena and possibly get a glimpse of how it could look in the future. However, along with that, there was a major reason behind the deal.\nAs Stern said, \u201cSo partially, they [NASCAR] did it to spread their eggs in multiple baskets but also part out of it was to get more money and to make sure they get more money in the industry at the time when their teams are saying we need more money, we are not profitable currently.\u201d\nWATCH THIS STORY: NASCAR\u2019s Charter Conundrum: A Twist in the Tale?\nThe SBJ journalist then explained that NASCAR was more or less left with no choice when it came to this deal. He said, \u201cNASCAR is in a tough situation because they had to deliver more money as well and clearly if they went this route, that\u2019s a good indication that\u2019s because they had to go this route to deliver more money for the industry.\u201d\nWhile NASCAR secured an impressive deal, there could be downsides to it and Stern explained it beautifully.\nAdam Stern points out a key potential drawback with NASCAR\u2019s new media rights deal\nSafe to say, NASCAR has been struggling to keep their teams happy in terms of profitability. Since the introduction of the Next Gen cars, it has only become more difficult for the Cup Series teams and teams in other competitions. While they have taken a commercial hit, they have piled up pressure on NASCAR to help out in this case.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn addition to that, Sports Business Journalist Adam Stern detailed one important issue with the new media rights deal. Speaking on the same podcast, he said, \u201cWhen you look at the deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, those races are going to be simulcast not just on MAX streaming but also on TNT and TNT is cable, not a free-to-air channel.\u201d\nStern continued explaining how it can come back to haunt. He said, \u201cYou have that on the cable subscription. So, the number of races that are going down that have been on the network, that\u2019s what teams are concerned about because the ratings will probably be lower.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nWith not every fan having access to all platforms, it is a tricky situation both for the fans and NASCAR. However, the sanctioning body has gone ahead and made its move with the new media rights deal. Now, it remains to be seen how the execution part works out. For now, it looks like NASCAR has secured itself well by bringing more money to the table.\nKyle Larson Believes NASCAR\u2019s Multi-Billion Dollar Media Rights Deal Is a Step in the Right Direction Despite Fans\u2019 Backlash\n\nThis article, authored by Priyank Mithani, was published by Essentially Sports on 2023-12-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":186}

{"title":"Amazon brings conversational AI to kids with launch of \u2018Explore with Alexa\u2019","context":"## Amazon brings conversational AI to kids with launch of \u2018Explore with Alexa\u2019\n\nAmazon\u2019s Echo devices will now allow kids to have interactive conversations with an AI-powered Alexa via a new feature called \u201cExplore with Alexa.\u201d First announced in September, the addition to the Amazon Kids+ content subscription allows children to have kid-friendly conversations with Alexa, powered by generative AI, but in a protected fashion designed to ensure the experience remains safe and appropriate.\nThough there are already some AI experiences that cater to younger users, like the AI chatbots from Character.ai and other companies, including Meta, Amazon is among the first to specifically look to generative AI to develop a conversational experience for kids under the age of 13.\nThat also comes with constraints, however, as generative AI can be led astray or \u201challucinate\u201d answers, while kids could ask inappropriate questions. To address these potential problems, Amazon has put guardrails into place around its use of gen AI for kids.\nFor starters, the Alexa Kids science team narrowed down the new experience, which leverages Alexa\u2019s LLM (large language model) technology, to include only kid-friendly fun facts and trivia questions. Initially, the content will come from just two partners, the World Wildlife Fund and A-Z animals. In time, the team would like to expand the AI to include other areas of interest to kids, like space, music, video games and sports.\nIn addition, and perhaps most importantly, the generative AI experience is not happening in real time on the device.\n\u201cWe want to go slow and be intentional and be measured with how we\u2019re introducing this new tech, as well as any new tech for kids, which is why we\u2019re not just hooking the experience up to an LLM at runtime and kind of letting kids go at it,\u201d explains Arjun Venkataswamy, senior product manager for Alexa Kids, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThe way that we\u2019ve integrated an LLM here is we use it to generate content at scale offline, and then go through a review process that includes both humans, as well as AI, and then take that reviewed content and then put it into our experience,\u201d he says.\nIn other words, kids aren\u2019t using generative AI on the fly when conversing with Alexa, and the content is pre-reviewed and comes from a small dataset of just animal facts and sources.\nHowever, because the AI can generate tens of thousands of potential responses, not every answer can be reviewed by a human before being added to the experience. To that end, Amazon is also using AI to help it review the materials it\u2019s using for \u201cExplore with Alexa.\u201d\n\u201cWhat our AI is doing is taking trusted content and then figuring out what\u2019s fun, looking at what\u2019s fun, turning them into a trivia question \u2014 so it is doing useful things for us at scale that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do without this tooling\u2026but we feel really good about the safety guardrails that are in place right now in terms of content,\u201d says Venkataswamy.\nTo access the new experience, kids can trigger the AI-generated facts or trivia in one of two ways. They can either utter a particular phrase that kicks off \u201cExplore with Alexa,\u201d like \u201cAlexa, let\u2019s explore animals\u201d or \u201cAlexa, tell me an animal fact.\u201d But the more interesting way to use this feature is to have kids engage in organic conversations with Alexa where this topic could come up. For instance, a kid might ask \u201cWhat does a lion\u2019s roar sound like?\u201d or \u201cHow fast can a cheetah run?\u201d This would also allow kids to enter the more conversational Q&A experience.\nPlus, over the next few months, Alexa will also prompt kids on some occasions, asking if they want to hear something interesting about animals.\nUnlike more traditional conversations with Alexa, the AI experience works two ways. That is, it\u2019s not just kids asking Alexa a question and receiving a response.\n\u201cOne of the things we think is really cool about this paradigm is kids aren\u2019t just asking Alexa questions and getting the answers \u2014 Alexa is now asking kids questions,\u201d says Venkataswamy. That is, Alexa could ask the kids a trivia question like \u201cWhat\u2019s the fastest animal on Earth?\u201d\nAs any teacher will tell you, by having the kids try to think of the answer first, the answer will stick in their minds better when they hear the response.\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s, it\u2019s narrow. Alexa is asking kids trivia questions,\u201d Venkataswamy continues. \u201cBut we want to continue expanding on that and making it more interactive.\u201d\nEventually, Amazon wants to have this generative AI experience integrated at runtime for both kids and adults, but it knows it needs to proceed carefully, especially with the former.\n\u201cWe do want to integrate an LLM in runtime in a more protected way than we would integrate it for adults\u2026However, this approach lets us iterate and figure out the right ways to get both safe and delightful content outputted from the LLM for kids,\u201d says Venkataswamy.\nAmazon is also preparing to launch an AI-powered \u201cLet\u2019s Chat\u201d Alexa experience for adults later this year, he says.\nIn terms of privacy, the company notes it\u2019s not training its LLM on kids\u2019 answers. In addition, the \u201cExplore with Alexa\u201d experience and any future LLM-backed features will continue to follow the same data handling policies of \u201cclassic Alexa\u201d (non-AI Alexa). That means the Alexa app will include a list of the questions asked by kids in the household (those with a kids\u2019 profile) and the response Alexa provided.

How we tested the TikTok pixel We downloaded a Chrome extension called Omnibug, which is used to test marketing and analytics tools.\nWith the extension installed, we visited websites such as Sportsbet, Kmart, Beyond Blue and many others.\nWe went to sign up for an account on those websites, entering personal information including our full name, email address, phone number.\nUsing Omnibug, we could see in real time that information being sent back to TikTok, often before clicking \u201cI consent\u201d to the website\u2019s privacy policy. TikTok uses a tool called \u201cautomatic advanced matching\u201d that sees when a user enters text into a form field or a search box, and if it looks like an email address or phone number, it scrapes that data.\nSimilar data is sent to Google and Meta, but only after \u201cI consent\u201d, for example, has been ticked. \u201cWhen The Age and Sydney Morning Herald alerted us to this issue, we immediately commenced a review of our privacy policy and removed the TikTok pixel from our website. Our investigations are continuing as a priority. \u201cLike many health organisations, Beyond Blue uses tools such as pixels to help us deliver safe and relevant content to people online.\u201d\nA Sportsbet spokesman said: \u201cWe use advanced matching, and that\u2019s consistent with targeting advertising methods that a lot of companies use. Our understanding is they don\u2019t decrypt or use hashed data that has been shared with them.\u201d Loading Kmart did not respond to requests for comment. The tests by this masthead found that for Google and Meta\u2019s tracking pixels, email addresses and phone numbers were sent to Google and Meta only after a user had consented to the websites\u2019 privacy policies. According to TikTok\u2019s website, the tracking pixel can \u201chelp you find new customers, optimise your campaigns and measure ad performance\u201d.\n\u201cWith the pixel, you can track website visitor actions, like view page or purchase, and create audience segments to re-engage previous site visitors or model lookalikes to find new customers,\u201d TikTok says on its website. TikTok has rejected claims the pixel breaches Australia\u2019s privacy laws. Credit: AP \u2018Remove that pixel\u2019 The extent of data collected by TikTok\u2019s pixel without user consent has caused concern among Australian marketers. Marketing and advisory agency Civic Data has issued a warning to its clients recommending they remove the pixel from their websites on privacy grounds. In the client bulletin on December 20, which was obtained by this masthead, Civic Data director Chris Brinkworth said his company had \u201crepeatedly observed non-consensual collection of personal data on Australian wagering, telco, finance, supermarket, e-commerce, charity and media organisations\u2019 websites.\nLoading \u201cThis raises serious privacy concerns regarding the lack of transparency, misuse of personal information and disregard for consent requirements under current regulations such as the Privacy Act 1988. Civic Data\u2019s recommendation is that all Australian businesses consider removing the TikTok pixel and other TikTok integrations from their platforms if they cannot guarantee that the data usage matches the consent given by consumers.\u201d Civic Data\u2019s clients include accounting software company Xero, Ticketek, Carsales, RACV and BlueScope. Call to protect Australians Senator James Paterson has called for an urgent probe by Australia\u2019s information commissioner.\nPaterson, the Coalition\u2019s cybersecurity spokesman, this year chaired a committee into foreign interference through social media that grilled TikTok executives. \u201cThis is a very serious and potentially unlawful mass breach of the privacy of TikTok users, former users and non-users,\u201d he told this masthead. Senator James Paterson has called for an urgent probe by Australia\u2019s information commissioner. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen \u201cIt would be concerning from any company but is particularly alarming given TikTok is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party and has admitted its China-based employees frequently access Australian user data. There\u2019s nothing to stop this industrial-scale unauthorised data collection being simply handed over to Chinese intelligence and security agencies, as TikTok and its employees are obliged to do under Article 7 of China\u2019s National Intelligence Law. \u201cThe information commissioner must commence an urgent investigation into TikTok Australia and use their full range of enforcement powers to protect Australians from this extraordinary surveillance.\u201d\nA spokesman for the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner said the agency was monitoring issues relating to TikTok\u2019s handling of personal information, particularly in light of the findings made by the British Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in an investigation into the company. Loading \u201cThe OAIC will give consideration to the information raised which alleges data scraping in regard to TikTok\u2019s practices,\u201d the spokesman said. A TikTok spokeswoman denied the pixel breaches Australia\u2019s privacy laws. \u201cWe strongly reject the suggestions outlined by Civic Data and are disappointed that a company would deliberately try to mislead or scare companies without regard to current law or the information available,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPixel usage, which is voluntary for our advertising clients to adopt, is an industry-wide tool used to improve the effectiveness of advertising services. Our use of this tool is compliant with all current Australian privacy laws and regulations, and we dismiss any suggestion otherwise.\u201d The China connection In 2016, China designated big data a \u201cfundamental strategic resource\u201d, and four years later its government designated data as the fifth \u201cfactor of production\u201d, joining land, labour, capital and technology. Its national intelligence laws allow the ruling Communist Party to pull data upon request from companies based in the nation. China\u2019s National Intelligence Law of 2017 requires all organisations and citizens to \u201csupport, assist and co-operate with the state intelligence work\u201d, and the Australian government this year banned TikTok on government devices over security concerns related to China\u2019s intelligence laws. Governments from Britain, Canada, France and New Zealand have also banned the app from official devices.\nJocelinn Kang, technical specialist at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said data from a tracking pixel could be aggregated across websites, apps and social media platforms. She said pixel tracking could identify users through their \u201cbrowser fingerprint\u201d \u2013 a combination of their IP address, browser and system details. Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Strategic Policy Institute researcher Samantha Hoffman said the data collected by TikTok\u2019s pixel was similar to that of US-based tech giants Google and Meta, but the difference was \u201cthe intent\u201d.\nAdvertising data had \u201cincredible propaganda value\u201d, she said. Loading \u201cIf you think about that, plus the access that TikTok is required to give the Chinese government, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d In November 2022, TikTok changed its privacy policy to make it explicitly clear user data can be accessed by some employees from across the world, including China. \u201cThey talk about how even data collected overseas can be used by the company and its partners, and would be kept private unless security organisations make demands of it,\u201d Hoffman said.\n\nThis article, authored by David Swan, was published by The Age on 2023-12-25 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":189}
{"title":"Tires are saving us \u2014 and killing us, too","context":"## Tires are saving us \u2014 and killing us, too\n\nPart of \/ We only get one planet\nTires are the most important safety component on a car, yet there\u2019s increasing research that they\u2019re doing a good deal of harm, too. Slowly, surely, one mote of black dust at a time, tires are leaving their mark on the environment.\nAccording to researchers at Imperial College London, our cars and trucks emit 6 million tons of tire wear particles every year, transportation detritus that goes into the air, the land, and the water. That\u2019s a massive figure that ignores the nearly 250 million tires that are disposed of annually in North America, roughly half of which are burned.\nIt\u2019s a depressing state of affairs, but there is room for optimism. Every major tire manufacturer globally is raising its game \u2014 not only in terms of performance in the face of bigger, heavier electric cars but also in terms of environmental impact. Renewable materials are finding their way into modern tires, and there\u2019s even greener rubber on the horizon, too.\nTruly sustainable tires are becoming a reality, but will it be enough?\nRenewable rubber\nBridgestone\u2019s \u201cWireless-In-Wheel\u201d technology.\nIf you watched any IndyCar road course race this year, basically any of the half-dozen events where the drivers had to turn right as well as left, you might have noticed some green flashes on those cars\u2019 tires. It wasn\u2019t just a visual flair to an otherwise visually dull part of the equation.\nThose tires contained guayule, part of an agrarian prototype effort from Bridgestone, the supplier of spec tires for that series. It\u2019s a high-profile demonstration of a new domestically sourced, renewable source of rubber that augments other natural sources like that from the hevea tree and even the Russian dandelion.\nTruly sustainable tires are becoming a reality, but will it be enough?\nBridgestone\u2019s Bill Niaura, executive director of sustainable innovation and circular economy, says guayule is a drop-in replacement with many potential advantages. Chief among them? Location: \u201cHevea trees are primarily grown in Southeast Asia,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile guayule is grown in the Southwestern US.\u201d\nThis is also a climate resiliency play. Guayule provides an alternate drought-resistant source for natural rubber at a time when global temperature patterns are behaving like the stock market: highly unpredictable but trending upward.\nVirtually every tire manufacturer is making at least token efforts to increase the usage of sustainable materials like guayule. Yokohama is using motorsports to develop its Advan A005 tire, which debuted at last year\u2019s Pikes Peak International Hill Climb and contains 33 percent sustainable materials, including biomass-derived rubber. Michelin, meanwhile, shod Porsche\u2019s prototype electric GT4 e-Performance racer with tires said to be 53 percent renewable, like strap steel and lemon peels.\nThat all may sound like marketing plays \u2014 and it partly is \u2014 but motorsports have historically proven an ideal development opportunity in the automotive industry. Track tires are pushed to their limits, resulting in better products for the road. In time, at least.\nMany manufacturers have a self-imposed deadline for a shift to renewable sourcing for materials. Dunlop is promising 40 percent of its tires will be renewable by the end of this decade and 100 percent by 2050. Bridgestone\u2019s goal is also 2050 but is introducing models now with an increased focus on sustainability, like the Turanza EV, made of 50 percent renewable and recycled materials.\nHow all of this factors into each manufacturer\u2019s specialty blends is complicated, but generally, it breaks down like this:\n\u201cNatural rubber and synthetic rubber each represent about 25 percent of materials used in tire manufacturing. Fillers, primarily carbon black and silica, represent an additional 25 percent,\u201d Bridgestone\u2019s Niaura says. \u201cThe remaining percentage consists of steel, textiles, oils, resins, and other ingredients used to cure the tire or serve as anti-degradants.\u201d\nBy blending different components, manufacturers can adjust a tire\u2019s grip (how sticky it is), tread life (how long it lasts), and rolling resistance (how efficient it will make your car). High-grip tires are traditionally short-lived and inefficient, but thanks to sticky science and renewable materials, that\u2019s changing.\nSilica is a good example and an increasingly important component.\nSilica is a good example and an increasingly important component. It not only displaces less renewable materials but also makes tires more efficient. \u201cConventional tires rely on carbon black to strengthen the rubber matrix as the tire is cured,\u201d Dale Harrigle, Bridgestone\u2019s chief engineer for replacement tires, says. \u201cIn a tire that uses silica in the tread compound, a portion of the carbon black is removed and replaced with silica, which allows for increased wet performance and reduced rolling resistance.\u201d\nSilica traditionally comes from sand, but that\u2019s changing. Goodyear, for example, is now using silica sourced from a rice processing byproduct called husk ash.\nIn other words: less harmful rubber, more grip, better wear, and better range or fuel economy.\nThe molecular menace\nFirestone\u2019s IndyCar tires.\nDrive long enough, and the well-defined tread patterns of even the most efficient tires will fade, slowly balding like a stressed-out environmental scientist\u2019s pate. It\u2019s easy to imagine that the lost rubber simply disappears, but the truth is more terrifying.\nTires break down into tire and road wear particles, or TRWP. This black dust accumulates on roads mostly \u2014 but not permanently. When it rains, it is carried away.\nA recent Pew Charitable Trusts report found that 78 percent of ocean microplastics are synthetic tire rubber, which makes efforts to cut down on microfiber pollution from our laundry seem a bit quaint.\n\u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is all these little wear particles full of all these nasty compounds settling in the environment and inside us and gradually leaching out their toxins,\u201d says Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, an independent group focused on testing and data about the overall environmental impacts of transportation.\n\u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is all these little wear particles full of all these nasty compounds settling in the environment and inside us and gradually leaching out their toxins.\u201d\nOne such toxin is 6PPD-quinone. A 2020 study from the University of Washington\u2019s Center for Urban Waters found that a dramatic decline in coho salmon populations was the result of the toxin. The salmon have now been placed on some West Coast endangered lists.\n\u201cShortly after birth, they were essentially going mad and dying,\u201d Molden says. \u201cThe researchers finally linked it to this compound in tires because it was happening after rainfall. The rainfall was washing all the accumulated tire material off the road into the harbors and into the shore.\u201d\nThat isn\u2019t bad just for the salmon and the Pacific Northwest\u2019s fishing industry. 6PPD-quinone is in us, too, and it only comes from tires. 6PPD helps tires resist environmental damage, thus lasting longer between replacements. When 6PPD reacts with ozone, it becomes 6PPD-quinone.\n\u201cThe product 6PPD-quinone, which was identified in late 2020, requires more research to understand what impact, if any, it may have on aquatic life or the environment,\u201d Goodyear SVP of global operations and CTO Chris Helsel says. That\u2019s hardly a mea culpa, but the tire industry genuinely has been an active partner in studying the problem.\nGoodyear and other members of the US Tire Manufacturers Association actually encouraged 6PPD-targeting regulation enacted by the California Environmental Protection Agency and have provided free tire compound samples to researchers. \u201cFor the next five years, if you want to sell tires in California, you need to go through the process of either eliminating 6PPD, or at least properly researching the alternatives,\u201d Molden says.\n\u201cWe are collaborating with researchers and other scientists to better understand this transformation product, fill knowledge gaps, and determine next steps,\u201d says Helsel.\nOther initiatives are coming to limit overall tire emissions, including the upcoming Euro 7 regulations, which put caps on tire wear particles as well as other emissions.\nThat seems like progress, but Emissions Analytics\u2019 Molden isn\u2019t so sure: \u201cThe reason I\u2019m worried about that is I\u2019m sure you can reduce that wear mass, but if you do that by making the compound more toxic, you could actually make the environmental impact worse.\u201d\n\u201cYou could actually make the environmental impact worse.\u201d\nThat could be akin to increasing a car\u2019s fuel efficiency by switching to leaded fuel.\nMolden believes that what\u2019s needed is better understanding. To that end, he\u2019s recently created the Tyre Emissions Research Consortium, a LinkedIn group with about 1,000 members. The intent is to break down the silos that individual researchers were working in.\nResearch into 6PPD replacements is ongoing, and the US Tire Manufacturers Association is also touting research into various ways to mitigate and reduce tire debris pollution.\nGiven all that research is happening at an industry level, it\u2019s easy to feel a little helpless about the role we\u2019re all playing in contributing this pollution to the environment when we\u2019re just trying to get to work. Still, there are things that we can do to help minimize the environmental impact in the interim.\nMolden suggests a few things: drive more slowly, drive more smoothly, and choose the right tires. According to Molden, the tires that your car was outfitted with when new will provide the best wear characteristics. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like going to a flight in restaurants, and each course has a wine match to the food,\u201d he says. Perfectly paired tires may cost more than whatever you can get at a local discounter, but they\u2019ll provide better wear and, ultimately, less pollution.\nEnd of the road\nMichelin\u2019s Uptis.\nEven the best tires will need to be replaced, either thanks to wear or the kind of roadside debris that can not only ruin a tire but also your entire day. The good news is that modern tires last a lot longer than they did before. \u201cIn the early 1970s, the typical wear life for a set of tires was approximately 20,000 miles in average driving conditions,\u201d Harrigle says. \u201cFast forward to today, and 80,000-mile wear warranties are relatively common.\u201d\nThe bad news is that we\u2019re still going through more tires than ever.\nThe bad news is that we\u2019re still going through more tires than ever. Harrigle says we scrap 250 million tires every year in North America. Again, about half are burned for fuel.\nBut there are other solutions. Recycling is one, but reuse is better, a process called retreading. Retreading itself is nothing new, but while it\u2019s generally fallen out of favor for consumer tires, on the industrial side of things, it can be a huge cost-saver \u2014 and environment-saver, too.\nJason Roanhouse, VP of North American Bandag operations at Bridgestone Mobility Solutions, says that the company\u2019s retread business has saved 300 million tires from being thrown out, worth roughly 4 billion gallons of oil.\nFuture tires\nWhile efforts to find sustainable replacements for tire manufacturing compounds continue, as does research into what today\u2019s compounds do to our health, many manufacturers are trying to change the equation altogether.\nA near-future example is the Michelin Uptis, a non-pneumatic tire. It relies on modern composites instead of air pressure to provide the right mix of stiffness and flex with significantly more durability. Michelin says it could reduce tire replacements by 20 percent. Variations of this theme have been in development for decades, but models are in testing now for consumer and industrial use.\nGoodyear gave us a more radical vision of a more distant future tire with 2020\u2019s ReCharge concept, which proposed that a biodegradable tread could be recharged simply by inserting refillable capsules with seasonal compounds. As a concept, it\u2019s pretty far out there. Goodyear\u2019s Helsel confesses as much, calling them \u201cpurely conceptual designs\u201d that \u201cmight never be produced as such.\u201d However, he says that the non-pneumatic nature of those concepts, and the advanced sensors embedded within, are indicative of ongoing research into future tires.\nAnother concept, though, is less about increasing the sustainability of tires and more about increasing the viability of EVs. At this year\u2019s Japan Mobility Show, Bridgestone showed off what it calls a \u201cWireless In-Wheel Tire.\u201d The concept is simple: turn every tire into an inductive charging pad for your EV. Previous wireless, in-motion charging concepts for EVs struggled to maintain strong rates because the car kept bouncing up and down as it moved.\nWireless charging works best when there\u2019s minimal distance between the charger and the device being charged. So, in this case, the tires themselves contain the receiving coils since, again, they\u2019re the only part of the car that actually touches the ground.\nSolutions like this seem fanciful, but they at least show that there\u2019s still a lot of room to rethink what a tire can and should be.\n\nThis article, authored by Tim Stevens, was published by The Verge on 2023-11-17 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":190}
{"title":"Digital twin market: Analyzing growth and 4 emerging trends","context":"## Digital twin market: Analyzing growth and 4 emerging trends\n\nBy the IoT Analytics team.\nA new report from IoT Analytics highlights eight notable trends helping to advance and promote digital twins.\nFour of these trends are discussed in detail in this article. These trends are shaping the future of the digital twin market and influencing investment priorities for companies across various industries.\nKey insights:\nAccording to our Digital Twin Market Report 2023\u20132027, the digital twin market is expanding, with a projected CAGR of 30% between 2023 and 2027.\n29% of global manufacturing companies have either fully or partially implemented their digital twin strategies. Further, job posts related to digital twins have increased by 11% compared to October 2021, while openings for other tech topics have declined in the same timeframe.\nThe report notes eight notable trends helping to advance and promote digital twins, four of which are discussed in this article.\nDigital twin market snapshot\nData from our Digital Twin Market Report 2023\u20132027 indicates that 29% of global manufacturing companies have either fully or partially implemented their digital twin strategies, marking a noticeable increase from 20% in 2020. Moreover, the proportion of these companies not contemplating the implementation of digital twins appears to have reduced to 9% in 2023, down from 33.6% in 2020.\nSupporting this trend, an analysis of job postings on SimplyHired suggests a growing demand for digital twin expertise. Postings mentioning \u201cdigital twin\u201d increased by 11% in October 2023 compared to just two years prior, while openings for most other tech topics declined in the same timeframe. Notably, among the 60 tech-related skill sets we tracked, digital twin-related skills experienced one of the most significant growths.\nBased on these observations and additional insights from our report, our current projection estimates that the global digital twin market could grow at a CAGR of approximately 30% between 2023 and 2027.\nAgainst the backdrop of this growing market, the report notes eight trends that help promote the advancement and adoption of digital twins. Here, we will focus on four:\n1. Digital twins deployed to meet sustainability goals\n2. Digital twins employed as virtual sensors in complex conditions\n3. Partnerships between cloud hyperscalers and OT and simulation specialists\n4. Initiatives promoting interoperability of digital twins across multifaceted systems\nBefore we dive into these trends, and to provide context, it is helpful to understand how IoT Analytics defines digital twins and the digital twin market.\nDefining digital twins and the digital twin market\nIn our March 2023 Decoding Digital Twins article, we define digital twins as a virtual model replicating the behavior of an existing or a potential real-world asset, system, or multiple systems. This definition captures a macro concept of digital twins, but our report and previous article present a three-dimensional, cuboid model to help classify digital twins so apple-to-apple comparisons can be made. Each axis of the cuboid represents one dimension of a digital twin:\n1. Life cycle phase: The X-axis represents the six life cycle phases a digital twin is used for, from design to decommissioning.\n2. Hierarchical levels: The Y-axis represents a digital twin\u2019s five hierarchical levels, from information to multi-system.\n3. Use\/purpose of implementation: The Z-axis represents the seven most common uses for digital twins, such as simulation and prediction.\nBased on this model, there are 210 potential combinations (5 x 6 x 7 = 210); however, our research indicates that many digital twin initiatives are tailored to multiple combinations.\nIn terms of the digital twin market, our market model only considers software spending for digital twins, which we break into two scopes:\nBroad digital twin market \u2013 includes the revenue for all software solutions that provide capabilities that are used for digital twins, such as solutions that integrate data sources into a digital twin and are capable of simulation, visualization, and predictions\n\u2013 includes the revenue for all software solutions that provide capabilities that are used for digital twins, such as solutions that integrate data sources into a digital twin and are capable of simulation, visualization, and predictions Narrow digital twin market \u2013 only considers spending for digital twin-specific software, such as software intended to model the digital twin data\nThough hardware and services related to digital twins can bolster the capabilities of digital twin software, we only view them as supporting services for the software, and we do not consider them in our digital twin market model. That said, this ability to bolster capabilities means they can aid digital twin market growth, as shown in some of the trends below.\nDigital twin market trends\nWe will now look at four trends helping digital twin market growth.\nTrend 1: Digital twins deployed to meet sustainability goals\nSustainability was discussed in approximately 21% of recent CEO earnings calls and has remained a consistent topic throughout 2023. This pairs with our report\u2019s analysis that the pursuit of sustainability goals is a tailwind macro factor for the digital twin market.\nTo achieve their sustainability goals, many companies are exploring digital twins. Due to their ability to simulate real-world conditions and deliver real-time information, organizations can optimize resource usage, reducing carbon emissions and improving supply and transportation networks.\nAccording to Capgemini Research Institute\u2019s 2022 digital twins report, 57% of organizations agreed that one of the key drivers for their digital twin investments was improving their sustainability, and 51% agreed that digital twins would help achieve their organization\u2019s environmental sustainability goals.\nIn our report, a former VP at an industrial automation vendor shared, \u201cDigital solutions provide the visibility, analysis, and insight needed to address the challenges inherent in sustainability goals. A digital twin strategy as part of an overall digitalization plan can be a crucial capability for asset-intensive industries and needs to encompass the entire asset lifecycle, process, and value chain from design and operations through maintenance and strategic business planning.\u201d\nExample: Aden, a Chinese integrated facility service provider, created a digital twin for one of its commercial centers in Chengdu, China. The digital twin was designed to help facility managers inspect, maintain, and repair building assets. 3D simulations assist facility managers in visualizing, predicting, and optimizing energy consumption, and the expected benefits include lower annual energy consumption, water usage, and waste.\nTrend 2: Digital twins employed as virtual sensors in complex conditions\nVirtual sensors approximate data that otherwise cannot be obtained via physical sensors, often due to physical sensors being impractical, costly, or hazardous to employ. Companies are now building digital twins to model hardware and calculate data based on other conditions. This not only allows the collection of data from complex equipment but also enables operators to track equipment performance and predict maintenance and downtimes.\nExample: In large motor applications, such as room-sized motors that pump high volumes of gas, oil, or other chemicals, operators need to monitor the motors\u2019 temperatures\u2014especially if the motors are high-powered and repeatedly started. If a motor is too hot during a restart, the components could cause serious damage. Unfortunately, using a direct, physical sensor within a motor is often impractical, and operators must work from an assumptive time it takes for the motor to cool (with an additional safety buffer time). This means motors can be down longer than necessary, impacting efficiency and revenue.\nTo address this issue, Siemens developed a prototype virtual sensor based on a digital twin. It offers a simulation of how a physical sensor would operate if it were possible to install it within a motor. Using AR headsets, operators can see a simulation of the motor and its interior with a demonstrator superimposed over it, and they can see the motor\u2019s temperature.\nTrend 3: Partnerships forged in the clouds: Hyperscalers team up with OT and simulation specialists\nIn the last few years, cloud hyperscalers like AWS and Microsoft Azure have introduced digital twin platforms, e.g., AWS IoT TwinMaker and Azure Digital Twins, that allow for interconnecting various data sources and building digital twin topology. However, these companies realize they cannot deliver end-to-end digital twin solutions by themselves and are thus partnering with OT and simulation companies to add capabilities to their networks.\nHyperscalers and OT companies\nOT companies provide industrial data management capabilities and connections to millions of local physical assets. By partnering with hyperscalers, OT companies can reach broader audiences looking for digital transformation solutions by offering typical cloud benefits like storage and computation power.\nExample: In 2021, Siemens and AWS announced an expansion of their partnership, with digital twin technology being an area of focus. The companies aimed to accelerate Siemens Xcelerator adoption and democratize new digital twin solutions using AWS IoT TwinMaker, a service intended to make creating digital twins that incorporate multiple data sources faster and easier.\nHyperscalers and simulation companies\nSimulation companies bring specialized expertise in creating accurate, high-fidelity models of physical entities, be it machinery, buildings, or entire ecosystems. By partnering with a hyperscaler, simulation companies can harness these cloud services\u2019 data storage and computational power to create more robust, responsive, and accurate data twins that can be scaled and integrated seamlessly into broader IT ecosystems.\nExample: In 2023, Ansys and Microsoft announced a partnership to help customers envision digital twins on a large scale. In cooperation with Tata Consultancy Services, Ansys and Microsoft integrated Ansys\u2019s Twin Builder\u2019s physics-based simulation capabilities with Azure Digital Twin and IoT data to allow Twin Builder users to run scenarios and obtain predictions on how their systems will behave.\nTrend 4: Initiatives promoting interoperability of digital twins across systems from different vendors\nAgreement on integration standards among the various digital twin technology providers is crucial for building cross-system digital twins.

{"title":"Martin Scorsese\u2019s late-stage career has proved Quentin Tarantino wrong","context":"## Martin Scorsese\u2019s late-stage career has proved Quentin Tarantino wrong\n\nIn 2021, Quentin Tarantino defended his intention to make \u201cjust\u201d 10 movies and retire, saying, \u201cI know film history, and from here on in, directors do not get better.\u201d That view of both artistry and film is squarely at odds with Martin Scorsese\u2019s historic body of work. Scorsese had already made his 10th feature-length narrative film by 1986. He is now 80 years old, and his 27th, Killers of the Flower Moon, is a strong argument that directors are still capable of groundbreaking greatness late in life \u2014 and in Scorsese\u2019s case, continued exhilarating experimentation and discovery.\nSince the year 2000, Scorsese has curated a 23-year career within a career, and the quality and variety of his films have come not in spite of his age and experience, but because of it. His movies have never been more relevant than they became during the past two decades. With each subsequent release, as his career winds down, critical appreciation for him grows. Scorsese worship is the one remaining form of gerontocracy America is perfectly content with, and with good reason.\nIn the 21st century alone, Scorsese has made nine feature-length narrative films: Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed, Shutter Island, Hugo, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence, The Irishman, and now, Killers of the Flower Moon. His stretch from 1976\u2019s Taxi Driver through 1990\u2019s Goodfellas is still his peak run, the films that defined his style and his perspective. But decades from now, the nine features he\u2019s made since 2000 won\u2019t be looked back on as half-baked, indulgent afterthoughts from a diminished artist who lost his fastball, a fate some great auteurs suffer in old age. Instead, it\u2019s a fertile, vital body of work, virtuosic in entirely new ways, and as important in contextualizing his greatness as all the incredible work that preceded it.\nOld classics\nSome of those nine movies are long-gestating bucket-list triumphs revisiting the pet subjects that defined Scorsese\u2019s oeuvre in the 20th century, often directly commenting on work from the front half of his career. 2002\u2019s Gangs of New York, about how organized crime was woven into the operation of Scorsese\u2019s native city from its inception, is a prequel (or ancestor) to his classics Goodfellas and Casino. 2019\u2019s The Irishman, about a man aging and dying with his guilt and sins unresolved at the end of a life of crime, is intended as a bookend to his crime trilogy with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. 2016\u2019s Silence is in conversation with, if not a synthesis of, the ideas explored in The Last Temptation of Christ and Kundun; all three are searching, anti-commercial religious films Scorsese struggled for years to get made.\nIn all Scorsese\u2019s late-period films (along with the passel of rock documentaries he\u2019s made during this era, including his two on Bob Dylan and one on George Harrison), Scorsese is consciously returning to certain pet subjects and periods in his work \u2014 not to repeat himself, but to revise and add greater perspective. There\u2019s a sense that he\u2019s trying to adjust his positions with the clear eye of an older person who has seen more of the world, dropped his pretensions, and lost his capacity for bullshit. His later films return to his old themes and obsessions, but in the process, they\u2019ve become more contemplative.\nNew tricks\nThis era has included some radical departures for Scorsese as well. 2004\u2019s The Aviator is his most conventional movie to date, the most traditional, Oscar-baity, Old Hollywood biography he\u2019s made. It\u2019s best understood as a director-for-hire palate-cleanser after Scorsese completed the odyssey of making the perpetually troubled Gangs of New York. 2010\u2019s Shutter Island is horror and suspense, an expert exercise in pure genre, part Hammer Films and part Alfred Hitchcock. It also contains some of the most inventive, moving, and painterly visuals he\u2019s ever committed to film.\nAnd 2011\u2019s Hugo is perhaps the hardest Scorsese film to imagine a younger Scorsese making. It\u2019s a 3D Robert Zemeckis-style family film that\u2019s also about the end of life and about immortality in art. Scorsese made the film as a love letter to Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, Harold Lloyd, and his own then-12-year-old daughter, Francesca. It\u2019s a project seemingly designed to remind fathers of all the times they tried to introduce their kids to their favorite old films. Hugo is explicitly about Scorsese\u2019s legendary cinephilia in a way his films that came before it are not, and it\u2019s sentimental in a way his work has never been before or since.\nNew life\n2002\u2019s Gangs of New York was the final product of an interesting but ultimately flawed compromise between Scorsese and producer Harvey Weinstein. But the film retains significance because it\u2019s the beginning of the defining relationship in this portion of Scorsese\u2019s career, with Leonardo DiCaprio. It was a symbiotic partnership that elevated both men: the industry outsider who needed a safe box-office bet to finally get his epic, expensive dream projects financed, and the teen heartthrob who needed an auteur with arthouse gravitas to take him seriously so the industry would.\nTo date, the project has been wildly successful, producing six films over 21 years. The first five (Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street) are Scorsese\u2019s top five highest-grossing films, with the box office for Killers incoming. Over the years, the Scorsese-DiCaprio team-up has served as a true creative marriage. The two men now share a manager in Rick Yorn, the man responsible for discovering DiCaprio. It\u2019s evidence DiCaprio hasn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d been a muse and face on the posters; he\u2019s had a say in deciding what projects Scorsese has taken on, and has even made significant decisions in shaping Scorsese\u2019s stories. (Scorsese entirely reimagined Killers of the Flower Moon after DiCaprio offered notes on an early draft of the script, including shifting focus to a different main character and moving DiCaprio into that role.)\nFor certain older filmmakers \u2014 say, Clint Eastwood \u2014 aging has meant settling for more routine and less challenging stories and shots, on a tight production schedule. Scorsese went in the other direction. From the outside, The Departed appears to be a cynical, domestic remake of a Hong Kong cops-and-robbers shootout. But Scorsese makes it his own and breathes bizarre life and energy into it. It contains the continuity errors, quick cutting, both rhythmic and arrhythmic needle bombs, and goofball humor his movies hadn\u2019t featured since Goodfellas. That film essentially birthed an entire genre of filmic language, but The Departed goes a step beyond the original. It was constantly being rewritten and adjusted with the actors on the fly. The result was exhilarating seat-of-the-pants filmmaking that Scorsese and his longtime creative partner, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, wrangled into a coherent film.\nScorsese brought this cokey, maximalist energy to The Wolf of Wall Street, a pointed comedy as wildly, masterfully off the rails and improvisational as anything he\u2019s ever done. (Jonah Hill perhaps smuggled in a touch of Judd Apatow\u2019s \u201cKeep the camera rolling\u201d ethos.) You can feel a healthy dose of Scorsese\u2019s established-filmmaker confidence (and a touch of \u201cEh, why not? Fuck it!\u201d thinking) as DiCaprio\u2019s Ferrari changes color mid-narration during a highway blowjob, and when DiCaprio addresses the camera directly, urging the audience not to worry about specific plot points. It\u2019s an absolute miracle Scorsese and Schoonmaker manage to produce a masterpiece out of the chaotic pieces of this production process (again in post, with ample voice-over). Everyone is letting loose, and to hear the actors and the director describe the shoot after the fact, it takes on something of a religious quality, with Scorsese as the wrinkled shaman handing out the peyote.\nWhat grounds it is the framing. Scorsese is telling us a familiar story we\u2019ve come to expect from him, about criminals and the pleasure they take in committing crimes and reaping the benefits. The brilliance is the way he mines filmgoers\u2019 long relationship with his work, repurposing the style and tone of his gangster classics and inserting it into the world of finance. As he\u2019s done effectively since Casino, Scorsese weaponizes postmodernism, using viewers\u2019 presumed existing familiarity with his films as context. You don\u2019t get the full gale force of this film, its pleasures and its overarching point, without Scorsese reaching back to his past work, and relying on viewers to recognize his voice in the storytelling.\nKillers of the Flower Moon\nKillers of the Flower Moon is perhaps most closely related to The Aviator as a film that appears to be a recognizable, industry-friendly form of awards-season prestige. It\u2019s also a return to Scorsese\u2019s core themes and characters. It\u2019s another cast of avarice-fueled, violent white American dumbasses gaining ill-gotten wealth and making the country incrementally worse. It\u2019s again about those men failing up, consolidating power, and shading the country more evil.\nKillers adapts a major literary work of historical true crime from a New Yorker writer. The book delves into an obscure but monstrous historical incident that is a cosmic truth in miniature, an evil that speaks to the heart of the entire dark American project. On screen, it\u2019s Scorsese\u2019s first true Western, filled with gorgeous vistas and Oklahoma horizons that would bring a tear to the eye of John Ford, one of Scorsese\u2019s many idols.\nBut the film is much stranger than it sounds on paper. Scorsese\u2019s take on the material largely operates outside the text, centering the story on a peripheral character we know little about from David Grann\u2019s book. Miraculously, the film also has its funny elements, incorporating The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street\u2019s nervy energy, featuring long and zany improvisational exchanges on grim subject matter, sudden wild swings in tone, and one major decision that should spark more debate and differences of opinion than any narrative device Scorsese has ever employed. It\u2019s a suspenseful, moving film with many brilliant parts.\nKillers is a classic Scorsese Catholic reckoning. This time, the director is concerned with white supremacy and systemic racism, full of unsparing and punishing conclusions and self recriminations in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death and the 2020 protests. (In a press conference on Oct. 16, Scorsese described the film as \u201ca story of complicity, a story of sin by omission.\u201d)\nScorsese is expressing guilt and culpability as a beneficiary of this inequality. In the movie\u2019s closing minutes, he literally puts himself squarely in the frame. That\u2019s a level of awareness that goes beyond the introverted morality plays he grappled with earlier in his career: It\u2019s a mature framing of the individual, and the responsibilities we have toward one another, on a societal scale.\nIn a charitable light, adding himself to the movie as the voice of its final reckoning is a bold statement of accountability. In an uncharitable light, it plays as performative, as an older relative getting worked up over a police brutality Facebook post. It\u2019s too early to decide how this film tags into our present historical moment, or how it will be remembered. We all have many viewings of and conversations about Killers of the Flower Moon ahead of us.\nA true master\nThis century has seen Scorsese zigging and zagging as always, but because he\u2019s following his own varied interests, not because he\u2019s moving from compromise to compromise, as he once had to in order to continue working. An artist who spent the first 30 years of his career desperate for autonomy finally got it, and now he\u2019s taking full advantage: telling difficult stories, setting his own mega-budgets, and demanding every minute of run time he feels each picture demands.\nHe\u2019s used this autonomy to revisit his work and revise the record, creating great new films as well as adding crucial addendums to past work. He\u2019s blazing new trails and adding new layers to his style. Remarkably, getting the control that eluded him when he was younger has made his films more consistently collaborative and creative, more fluid and alive than he was often allowed to be prior to the 2000s. He has the earned confidence of an artist who has spent a lifetime in film and knows he\u2019ll be able to find something great in post. His late period has only added to his legend. That should give Tarantino cause to reconsider \u2014 alongside any artist or critic who thinks the creative spark has an expiration date.\n\nThis article, authored by Abe Beame, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-26 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":192}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nMartin Scorsese has put his knowledge of internet slang to the test in a new TikTok challenge posted by none other than his daughter, Francesca Scorsese.\nIn a TikTok posted by Francesca on Thursday 5 October, the father-daughter duo appeared on camera while the legendary director\u2019s daughter explained that she was going to quiz him on popular internet slang. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to guess what specific slang terms mean,\u201d Francesca told her father, 80.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me the slang word and I have to give you what I think it means,\u201d Scorsese chimed in, in classic style.\nThe first - and arguably most important - internet slang word that Francesca quizzed her father on was \u201ctea\u201d, as she gave the example: \u201cI\u2019m going to spill the tea.\u201d\nThe Killers of the Flower Moon director shouted out his answer: \u201cThat means you\u2019re gonna tell all you know.\u201d\nFrancesca\u2019s face then lit up with shock after her father guessed the internet slang term somewhat correctly, and a green check mark emoji appeared over their heads.\nThe next term she gave her father was \u201cick\u201d and added the example: \u201cHe clapped when the plane landed and that gave me the ick.\u201d\n\u201cYou were thoroughly repulsed by it,\u201d Scorsese answered correctly, causing his daughter to burst out in laughter.\nThe third slang was \u201csneaky link\u201d - a term used when someone is going to discreetly meet up with their romantic interest. \u201cThese are our personal peccadillos that you may have,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that you don\u2019t want other people to know about, or just people close to you or something like that.\u201d\nWhen Francesca explained to her father that the term \u201csneaky link\u201d is similar to a \u201cbooty call\u201d, the Goodfellas director\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. \u201cOh, really? We never use that, we never saw specific people in my day,\u201d he replied, before curtly asking his daughter in his signature Italian-American accent: \u201cWhat else you got?\u201d\nFor the phrase \u201chits different\u201d, his daughter fittingly used a film reference to explain what the term means to her dad. \u201cWatching a movie in 70 mm film hits different,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an easy one. You perceive it in a totally different way,\u201d Scorsese responded. \u201cIt\u2019s another perspective of the image, so to speak, and the effect the film has on the audience.\u201d\n\u201cLike, it\u2019s much better,\u201d she corrected. \u201cHits different, like: \u2018Oh, this is amazing.\u201d\nWhile the Wolf of Wall Street director answered the term \u201cslept on\u201d incorrectly, his reasoning for the definition wasn\u2019t totally inaccurate. \u201cI was thinking about some stuff so I slept on it,\u201d Scorsese said. However, Francesca then used the slang word in terms that only Scorsese could understand.\n\u201cKing of Comedy was slept on,\u201d she added, referring to her father\u2019s 1983 film starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy received mostly positive reviews from critics when it was released, but it was a flop at the box office.\n\u201cPeople hated it when it came out,\u201d he corrected himself, before turning his gaze towards the camera. \u201cIt was the flop of the year, that\u2019s what it was called on Entertainment Tonight, New Year\u2019s Eve \u201883 to \u201884. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s alright.\u201d\nThe father-daughter duo continued on with the term \u201cate\u201d, as Francesca used an example from Scorsese\u2019s upcoming film: \u201cLily Gladstone ate in Killers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Although he took the term \u201cate\u201d very literally by initially saying, \u201cConsumed the screen\u201d, Scorsese eventually came up with the simple answer: \u201cRuled.\u201d\nFor the slang term \u201cno cap\u201d, Scorsese instantly answered it correctly as \u201cno lying\u201d. However, he then asked his daughter in classic dad fashion: \u201cHow many more of these?\u201d\nWhen it came to the internet slang \u201cship\u201d, the Taxi Driver director wasted no time in replying: \u201cA ship is a boat.\u201d Francesca aided her father with the example, \u201cI ship you and mom,\u201d but he still didn\u2019t seem to understand the phrase. \u201cTake us around somewhere?\u201d\nThe next term was \u201csimp\u201d - meaning someone who displays excessive affection in a relationship - but Scorsese decided to come up with his own definition: \u201cSympathise, a simpy person. A person who\u2019s whining all the time, they\u2019re simps.\u201d\n\u201cSimp used to mean a wimpy person, a person who\u2019s always complaining and stuff like that,\u201d he added. \u201cI do that a lot, complain a lot.\u201d\nFor the term \u201cthrow shade\u201d, Scorsese immediately understood what it meant after his daughter gave the film-themed example: \u201cThat critic threw so much shade.\u201d He was also quick to answer the slang \u201cslaps\u201d when Francesca said: \u201cThis dessert slaps.\u201d\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s good,\u201d he replied.\nThe final internet slang Francesca gave her famous father was none other than the term, \u201cslay\u201d.\n\u201cThis video slays. We slayed in this video\u201d she gave the example, as the Gangs of New York director answered: \u201cThat means it\u2019s really good?\u201d\nSince it was posted on Thursday, Francesca\u2019s video of her father guessing popular slang terms has been viewed one million times on TikTok. Not only were people in the comments section shocked to see the legendary director on their screens, but they were also stunned that he managed to guess many of the terms correctly.\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe we live in a world where I get to watch Martin Scorsese become familiar with the term sneaky link. Blessings,\u201d read one comment.\n\u201cI cannot believe I exist in a timeline where I can watch Martin Scorsese film TikToks,\u201d another said.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m watching one of the greatest filmmakers of our lifetime be quizzed by his daughter about teen slang lol,\u201d a third user wrote, while someone else said: \u201cGonna describe sneaky links as personal picadillos from now on.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Scorsese has made a special appearance in one of his daughter\u2019s TikTok videos. In April 2021, Francesca went viral when she asked her father to identify \u201cfeminine products\u201d, such as an eyelash curler, bobby pins, a hair donut and nipple pasties.\n\nThis article, authored by Meredith Clark, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-10 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":193}
{"title":"Potential Conor McGregor Fight Could Help Canelo Alvarez Come a Step Closer to Surpass Floyd Mayweather\u2019s Net Worth and His Billionaire Status","context":"## Potential Conor McGregor Fight Could Help Canelo Alvarez Come a Step Closer to Surpass Floyd Mayweather\u2019s Net Worth and His Billionaire Status\n\nCrossover boxing matches are all the rage these days. Until a few days ago, the phenomenon was limited to influencers and MMA stars. But after a recent quarrel on X (formerly Twitter) between Conor McGregor and Canelo Alvarez, a potential crossover boxing match has the boxing world buzzing with excitement. If the fight were to turn into a reality, it could help \u2018Cinnamon\u2019 get closer to his former rival Floyd Mayweather in terms of net worth.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nThe talks of Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather began with a tweet that launched a fiery exchange of words between these two mammoths of combat sports. The brash and confident \u2018Notorious\u2019 McGregor turned to X, praising Mayweather\u2019s 2013 performance against Canelo. But he also boasted about landing more punches on \u2018Money\u2019 Mayweather than the Mexican superstar. Canelo quickly retorted, asserting he would need only one hand to make quick work of McGregor. Later, the banter further escalated, bringing a potential fight in the picture.\nCanelo Alvarez\u2019s earnings and Floyd Mayweather\u2019s influence\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nCanelo Alvarez reached his career high by becoming the first boxer to become the undisputed champion at super-middleweight by holding onto the WBA Super, WBC, and Ring Magazine super middleweight titles since 2020, and the IBF nd WBO titles since 2021. Meanwhile, his pockets became deeper and deeper, to the point that Canelo boasts a $180 million net worth in 2023. The most significant addition to his bank balance came when he signed a lucrative $365 million deal with DAZN and Golden Boy Promotions.\nvia Imago RECORD DATE NOT STATED Saul -Canelo- Alvarez MEX vs Jermell Charlo USA \u2013 Weigh-in ceremony Saul -Canelo- Alvarez MEX during the weigh-in ceremony prior to the Boxing fight against Jermell Charlo USA, at the T-Mobile Arena Explanade on September 29, 2023. brbr Saul -Canelo- Alvarez MEX durante la ceremonia de pesaje previo a la pelea de Box contra Jermell Charlo USA, en la Explanada del Arena T-Mobile el 29 de septiembre de 2023.

When Mayweather defeated Canelo, it pushed him to hone his skills while starting a lifelong rivalry. On the other hand, McGregor made his boxing debut against Mayweather, losing the fight but leaving with a fat stack.\nImplications of a fight between Canelo Alvarez and Conor McGregor\nThe excitement and allure of two mammoths of combat sports getting in the ring to pummel each other to the brink of their endurance is undeniable. Not to mention, the fight will leave either party significantly wealthier than before. A potential clash between Saul Canelo Alvarez and the \u2018Notorious\u2019 Conor McGregor would not just be a dream come true for fans everywhere. It would also be a money magnet that would funnel income from a variety of channels.\nA few of those lucrative channels of income would be revenue from pay-per-view sales, live gate revenue, merchandise sales from either party and various promotional events from the fight. What\u2019s more, if anyone wondered if people would want to watch the fight. The attention it has gathered in the small span of their X (Twitter) feud should be evidence enough. Not to mention, both fighters command a massive fan base, counted in millions across the globe.\nCanelo Alvarez and McGregor\u2019s history of massive purses\nIf Canelo\u2019s PPV pull was ever in question, his history of fight purses should convince everyone. Stepping back in time, Canelo\u2019s fight with Mayweather collected 2.2 million pay-per-view buys. His 2017 bout against Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. collected 1 million PPV buys. Canelo\u2019s first battle with Gennady Golovkin gathered 1.3 million PPV sales. In his most recent battle against Jermell Charlo, the fight collected 700K PPV sales. These were just to name a few; over the years, Canelo has fought in increasingly profitable bouts.\nOn the other hand, Conor McGregor has created his own history in MMA as well as boxing. First of all, McGregor\u2019s fight against Mayweather generated 4.3 million pay-per-view buys. His second fight against Dustin Poirier collected 1.6 million buys. The infamous fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov saw 2.4 million PPV sales. And lastly, his second fight against Nate Diaz collected 1.65 million PPV buys. If these numbers are any evidence, a Canelo vs. McGregor clash would break all their previous records by a mile.\nA substantial step toward Mayweather\u2019s net worth\/Billionaire status\nIt\u2019s no secret that Floyd Mayweather is the richest boxer in the world. The legendary undefeated boxer boasts a staggering net worth of $450 million. It makes the retired boxer the richest personality in boxing to ever exist. Despite retiring from the sport, he occasionally fights in exhibition matches, generating millions each time.

If Canelo vs. McGregor ever manages to materialize, it could help Canelo take a significant leap to Mayweather\u2019s net worth.

{"title":"X plans to use payment, phone and ID verification to stop bots, in addition to the new $1\/yr fee","context":"## X plans to use payment, phone and ID verification to stop bots, in addition to the new $1\/yr fee\n\nX plans to use payment, phone and ID verification to stop bots, in addition to the new $1\/yr fee\nIt\u2019s official: X is charging users to use its service \u2014 a move X owner Elon Musk said would help the company combat bots and spam, something he\u2019s repeatedly complained about even before acquiring the social network. But while critics, including WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg, have suggested that fees alone will not stymie the efforts of determined spammers, an X engineer took to the platform to explain that the nominal $1 per year fee was not the only tool X planned to use to deal with its bot problem. Instead, it\u2019s only one piece of a broader plan to stop bots that may also include payment, phone and ID verification, in addition to traditional bot-catching methods involving heuristics.\nOn X, director of engineering Eric Farraro wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot of cynical takes about the $1 \u2018Not a Bot\u2019 feature and the verification program in general.\u201d He said he understood the skepticism but noted that, in a matter of years, AI will be able to mimic human interactions by doing things like solving CAPTCHAs and generating photos and videos that will be \u201cundetectable by human or AI countermeasures.\u201d That means current methods of catching bots will need to evolve.\n\u201cIf you can avoid getting identified as a bot, why can\u2019t an intelligent AI do the same?,\u201d Farraro asked.\nI've read a lot of cynical takes about the $1 'Not a Bot' feature and the verification program in general. I understand why people are skeptical, but consider a thought experiment: Are you sophisticated enough to evade X's bot detection? The answer is of course, yes, because\u2026 \u2014 Eric Farraro (@EFarraro) October 18, 2023\nHowever, critics have pointed out that a small fee like $1 or even $8 won\u2019t stop all bots. For instance, Mullenweg argued that spammers buy domains to use at a cost that\u2019s \u201cusually a lot more than a dollar per year,\u201d and that \u201cmillions are used for spam or nefarious purposes.\u201d In addition, he said spammers may also use stolen credit cards and identities to conduct their transactions.\n\u201cCharging may cause a short-term drop in bots while the bad guys update their scripts, but the value of manipulating X\/Twitter is so high I imagine there is already millions of dollars being spent on it,\u201d Mullenweg wrote on his blog.\nFarraro seemed to largely agree with this assessment, admitting that X\u2019s goal was \u201cto make it difficult and expensive enough that it\u2019s less and less viable,\u201d as opposed to stopping the bot problem outright. \u201cRight now, the cost to have a human or script create accounts is pennies. Increasing the cost to even $1 starts to make this process much more expensive,\u201d he explained. But, he added, fees were not the only tool X planned to use.\n\u201cAt X, we\u2019re exploring using payment & phone verification, as well as ID verification, as part of a larger strategy to fight bots. We of course use more traditional heuristics and models to detect fake accounts [and] engagement on the platform. These two things are not mutually exclusive,\u201d Farraro said, concluding that other networks would likely follow suit in the years ahead.\nHis statements mirrored comments recently made by Elon Musk, who said X would be \u201cmoving to a small monthly payment\u201d for use of the X system. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I can think of to combat vast armies of bots,\u201d he remarked during a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month, which had largely focused on AI tech, regulation and hate speech in the wake of Musk\u2019s recent spat with the Anti-Defamation League, which had accused both Musk and X of being antisemitic.\n\u201cBecause a bot costs a fraction of a penny \u2014 call it a tenth of a penny \u2014 but even if it has to pay\u2026a few dollars or something, the effective cost of bots is very high,\u201d Musk said at the time. Plus, every time a bot creator wanted to make another bot, they would need another new payment method, he explained. Today, he added that the fee \u201cwon\u2019t stop bots completely, but it will be 1000x harder to manipulate the platform.\u201d\nCorrect, read for free, but $1\/year to write. It\u2019s the only way to fight bots without blocking real users. This won\u2019t stop bots completely, but it will be 1000X harder to manipulate the platform. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 18, 2023\nThe plan to charge X new users $1 per year, currently only live in test markets of New Zealand and the Philippines, is the latest significant change to the network formerly known as Twitter since its acquisition by Elon Musk, who has revamped its subscription offering, refocused efforts on supporting creators and rebranded the network as \u201cX,\u201d as part of his broader plan to turn the social network into an everything app encompassing text, live and recorded, audio and video calling, payments and more.\nHowever, the timing of the bot-countering measure comes at a time when X is facing more competition than ever before. As Musk\u2019s chaotic product and policy changes have taken root, some X users abandoned the platform for rivals or decreased their posting. A report this week from market intelligence firm Similarweb, for example, found that X\u2019s web traffic and monthly active users on mobile had declined post-acquisition.\nUsers today have far more options for microblogging and public discourse, thanks to products from Twitter-like startups and tech companies such as Spill, Bluesky, Pebble, Countersocial, Spoutible, Hive and the open source platform Mastodon, as well as efforts from tech giants, like Meta\u2019s new app Threads. Few of the other social apps currently charge a fee, unless it\u2019s for premium features, like some of the third-party Mastodon apps do.\nIn addition to presenting friction at sign-up, other critics have argued a fee could exclude genuine users and increase the digital divide.\n\u201cEven the differences in the cost of living in the Philippines and New Zealand, the ability to afford $1 is not the same in the two countries,\u201d said Aditya Vashistha, an assistant professor of information science at Cornell University, who studies computing systems in the Global South. \u201cEven if the rationale behind creating a paywall is right, such policies would broaden the digital divide, making it difficult for people in the Philippines to be part of a global community on X compared to those in New Zealand,\u201d he said.\nStill, the idea of charging users a small fee to use a social platform is not a new idea. WhatsApp for years charged users a $1 annual fee up until 2016, as a means of monetization ahead of its creation of commercial services.\nGiven that X\u2019s current tests are only an experiment, it\u2019s not clear that the $1 fee will be a permanent requirement when the new subscription policy rolls out more broadly to other markets.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-18 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":195}
{"title":"With Amo, the founder of Zenly wants to make social apps social again","context":"## With Amo, the founder of Zenly wants to make social apps social again\n\nWith Amo, the founder of Zenly wants to make social apps social again The startup raised $20 million and is launching ID today\nIn 2018, I wrote a TechCrunch article stating that 2018 was \u201cthe year social networks were no longer social.\u201d Reflecting on that article, I\u2019m not sure that 2018 was the turning point. But the premise of the article still holds up well.\nAt some point, social networks were no longer about connecting with your closest friends, keeping up with long-distance family members and feeling a special connection with people you love.\nTikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, YouTube and X (formerly Twitter) are all slowly evolving to become the same infinite scrollable feed of algorithm-optimized short videos from top performers.\nAnd it turns out that I\u2019m not the only one who has noticed that social networks have been slowly drifting away from their original purpose. Amo, a small team based in Paris, has been working for the better part of 2023 on a brand new social app called ID.\nID is a social app launching today on iOS that lets you connect with your friends in a creative way. In many ways, it feels like the early days of blogs, Myspace\u2019s highly-personalized profile pages and the golden era of Tumblr.\nBut first, some context about Amo. There\u2019s a lot of hype and anticipation surrounding Amo\u2019s launch, as the company has been co-founded by Antoine Martin, who was the co-founder of Zenly with Alexis Bonillo. Zenly was a popular social app focused on location sharing that encouraged you to spend more time with your friends and discover new places.\nSnap spent more than $200 million to acquire Zenly and kept the same team to iterate on it, as a separate app. Under Snap\u2019s ownership, Zenly became one of Europe\u2019s biggest social apps of all time. At its peak the company had 18 million different users opening the app every day.\nAnd then\u2026 it disappeared.\nAs part of Snap\u2019s cost-cutting efforts, the company decided to shut down Zenly altogether. From what I\u2019ve heard, this move even triggered discussions between French politicians at the highest level and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel.\nMany key members of the Zenly team are now working at Amo. In fact, there are 10 co-founders. In addition to Martin, Corentin Kerisit, Michael Goldenstein, Claire Pluvinage, Charly Delaroche, Julien Martin, Quentin Perez, Nicolas Fallourd, Alexis Druon and Jean-Baptiste Dalido are all Amo co-founders and all former Zenly people.\nThe second reason Amo\u2019s launch is highly anticipated is that the startup closed a $20 million (\u20ac18 million) funding round in February or March at a valuation around \u20ac100 million with New Wave leading the round, and Coatue and DST Global Partners also participating. There are also 80 angel investors on Amo\u2019s cap table.\nThis is a highly unusual funding round, as it happened in 2023 (during a VC funding downturn), Amo is a mobile consumer startup (no source of revenue for now) and the startup didn\u2019t have any product out there.\nAn empty canvas\nIn 2010, J\u00fcrgen Schweizer from Cultured Code, the company behind personal task management app Things, wrote a blog post shortly after Steve Jobs introduced the original iPad. In that post, he compared the iPad to an empty canvas.\n\u201cIf you want to understand what makes the iPad special, you cannot look at what it has, but what it doesn\u2019t have. The iPad is so thin and light, it becomes the display, and the display becomes the application. No input devices. The device vanishes and turns into the application you are using. The technology is transparent,\u201d Schweizer wrote.\nAnd this analogy applies particularly well to ID and Amo\u2019s work as well. There are many things that you can do with ID. There are also many things that we take for granted in a social app that simply aren\u2019t there.\nID is an empty canvas paired with creative tools that help you express yourself. You can use it to create a profile that perfectly describes your interests in a visual manner. But there\u2019s a social twist as you can both see your friends\u2019 profiles and add things to their own profiles.\nWhen you first create your profile on ID, you get an empty whiteboard that is waiting for content. You can fill it yourself in four different ways.\nYou can add stickers from your sticker library (more on that later), you can grab content from your photo library, you can write text or you can draw. When you choose a photo, ID automatically creates a cut-out of the main object or subject in the photo using PhotoRoom\u2019s technology.\nThis will feel immediately familiar to Pinterest users who love to build mood boards or software developers who cover their brand new laptop lid with stickers.\nEvery virtual object can be moved, resized and rotated. After a while, your profile becomes this sort of spatial canvas. You can make things so small that they sort of disappear\u2026 unless you zoom in.\nYou can create small islands that define what\u2019s on your mind right now. For instance, you can have a Los Angeles corner with the favorite buildings you saw during your vacation, group photos with your friends, the cup of your favorite coffee shop there, etc. You can also have a restaurant corner with photos of food from fancy restaurants where you\u2019ve recently been.\nEverything feels smooth and natural. You scroll, zoom in, zoom out, jump from one profile to the other. There\u2019s a sense of depth and space that I\u2019ve never seen in any other app. Photos never feel pixelated and you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re waiting for something to load.\nIf you\u2019ve been using ID for a while, things can become messy \u2014 but so is life. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fine. My personality is chaotic \u2014 our personalities are chaotic. They\u2019re multifaceted and they\u2019re not neatly arranged in a 3\u00d73 grid,\u201d Amo CEO Antoine Martin said.\nEmergent gameplay\nAs you start browsing around the app and looking at what\u2019s new on your friends\u2019 profile page, you may want to steal something for your own wall. ID lets you add content from other profiles to your sticker library so that you can either add it to your own profile or put it on someone else\u2019s profile.\nI\u2019ve been using the app for a little bit more than a week, and I can already see some trends spreading around the small community of beta users. You can see who originally created a sticker as it moves around from one wall to another. Some users have put nice shelves so they can neatly categorize everything that matters to them. A user created a guestbook section on her profile. \u201cIf you\u2019re dropping by, please leave a note here,\u201d she wrote.\nA few video games rely heavily on the player\u2019s creativity to have fun, such as Minecraft or recent Zelda games. In these games, you can create your own fortress or build your own vehicle.\nAnd that\u2019s also the main concept behind ID. Amo gives you the creative tools and a limitless Figma-like canvas. Now, it\u2019s up to the community to figure out what they want to do with it. And the best part is that it doesn\u2019t look like any other social app out there.\nMaybe Amo will end up fostering a creator economy with exclusive content that can really make your profile stand out. Maybe the company will add some premium features over time. For now, Amo wants to find a hit.\n\u201cWe\u2019re prioritizing scale because my goal is to create an indestructible company. And it\u2019s Zenly\u2019s founder who is saying that! I used to think that 18 million [daily active users] would be enough to make a company indestructible. But I was wrong. I think you need 100 million [daily active users],\u201d Martin told me.\nCuring loneliness\nWhen the Amo team started working on ID, they wanted to find a way to cure loneliness. It seems a bit counterintuitive to build a social app as people spend so much time on their phone already. But, according to Antoine Martin, it\u2019s just that existing social apps don\u2019t have your best interests in mind.\n\u201cThe [World Health Organization] now calls it the loneliness epidemic. And if they say that it\u2019s an epidemic, it\u2019s because it\u2019s actually infectious. In other words, if you\u2019re isolated, your loved ones are too because you\u2019re unreachable. So during the two hours you\u2019re on TikTok, they have no one to talk to,\u201d Martin told me.\n\u201cAnd at the same time, the human needs that the social consumer space can fulfill are no longer covered by these products, whereas they used to be,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the early days of Facebook, I don\u2019t know if you remember, profiles were sort of a mash-up. There were drawings, games, photos, text. You\u2019d write long comments, it could be a poem . . . And on the other hand, it was a reminder that you mattered to these people.\u201d\nAccording to him, the current generation of social networks are very passive. You don\u2019t have to do much to spend two hours on TikTok or YouTube because these companies want you to spend as much time as possible in these apps. \u201cWe aspire to go back to these earlier precepts and make them work,\u201d Martin said.\nThat\u2019s also the reason why Amo doesn\u2019t want you to spend hours in the app. When you have a few minutes, you can open the app to check what\u2019s new on your friends\u2019 profiles by swiping up on the notification cards.\nWhen you\u2019ve reached the last card, ID shows you a message that says \u201cget some fresh air.\u201d And then, the app closes itself. You\u2019re back on the home screen, you can put your phone back in your pocket.\nAmo & ID\nID is an opinionated take on social apps, but is it going to work? Given the past experience of the team and Amo\u2019s deep pockets, if there\u2019s one team that has a shot at trying something radically new in the space, it\u2019s Amo.\n\u201cWe\u2019re deliberately shipping something eight or nine months after the launch of the company because we swore to ourselves that it wouldn\u2019t take us a year to get started, that we\u2019d learn more by building in public,\u201d Martin said.\nWhile ID is Amo\u2019s first idea, the company most likely has other ideas in the consumer social space \u2014 Amo didn\u2019t name its app \u201cAmo\u201d after all. So it\u2019s going to be interesting to follow the launch of this new app, but also Amo\u2019s story as a company.\n\nThis article, authored by Romain Dillet, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-19 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":196}
{"title":"Fantasy Football WR PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at wide receiver","context":"## Fantasy Football WR PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, best sleepers at wide receiver\n\nAs fantasy football owners gear up for the last week of the fantasy regular season (in most leagues), our Week 14 fantasy WR PPR rankings are loaded top to bottom with just two teams on bye. Rolling out a strong receiving corps in a potential must-win week is essential, and we're here to shore up your start 'em, sit 'em concerns.\nThe highlight of our rankings is the long-awaited return of Justin Jefferson, who is (finally) set to suit up for the first time since Week 5. It's easy to forget, but in Jefferson's four full games this year, he averaged just over eight receptions and 135.8 yards per game while scoring three total touchdowns. Few receivers can dominate as he can, so we're happy to welcome him back.\nOf course, Jefferson's return only helps one owner in each league, so let's break down the rest of the WR rankings to help you finish your season with a win.\nWhich WRs are on bye in Week 14?\nThe final set of bye weeks sees only the Commanders and Cardinals idle, resulting in the losses of Terry McLaurin, Marquise Brown, Jahan Dotson, Curtis Samuel, Rondale Moore, and Greg Dortch.\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nEven worse, Washington and Arizona sit as two of the weakest pass defenses in the league, so fantasy owners won't be able to count on big stats from their receivers going against the Commanders and Cardinals.\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWho are the best fantasy WRs in Week 14?\nThe league's leading receiver, Tyreek Hill (vs. Titans in Week 14), stands as the unquestioned WR1 for Week 14 after torching the Commanders to the tune of five catches, 157 yards, and two TDs. CeeDee Lamb (vs. Eagles) and the Cowboys look to avenge their road loss to the Eagles in Week 9, as Dallas' WR1 routinely has double-digit reception potential.\nAmon-Ra St. Brown (@ Bears) was relatively quiet this past week, but he's likely to rebound against a Bears defense that he totaled nine catches for 95 yards against in Week 11. A.J. Brown (@ Cowboys) reached the century mark for the first time in four games in Week 13, and another high-usage day looks to be in store for a potential shootout.\nKeenan Allen (vs. Broncos) caught just five-of-nine targets last week, but as L.A.'s only reliable receiving option, a get-right game feels likely this week. Justin Jefferson (@ Raiders) is set to suit up for the first time since Week 5, and as we alluded to earlier, he's a must-start whenever he's active.\nStefon Diggs (@ Chiefs) hasn't totaled 100-plus receiving yards in any of his past six games, but he has every chance to get back on track against a Chiefs coverage unit that showed some leaks in Sunday's loss to the Packers.\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nWho are the best fantasy WR sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 14?\nElijah Moore (vs. Jaguars), Noah Brown (@ Jets), Odell Beckham Jr. (vs. Rams), Jonathan Mingo (@ Saints), and Xavier Gipson (vs. Texans) are our preferred waiver-wire pickups in PPR formats for Week 14.\nMoore (vs. Jaguars) just saw 12 targets from Joe Flacco and is in line for another high-usage day with Amari Cooper (concussion) potentially sidelined. Brown (@ Jets) should also see a steady target share after Tank Dell's (leg) season-ending injury.\nBeckham Jr. (vs. Rams) is also likely to see increased usage with Mark Andrews (leg, ankle) done for the regular season. Mingo (@ Saints) has seen six-plus targets in his past four games, as his rapport with Bryce Young is strengthening by the week. Gipson led the Jets in receiving this past week (five receptions, 77 yards), and with New York routinely playing from behind, similar stat lines could be in the works.\nWEEK 14 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nWho are the biggest potential WR busts in Week 14?\nIt's tough to trust Calvin Ridley (@ Browns), Drake London (vs. Buccaneers), Jordan Addison (@ Raiders), and Jayden Reed (@ Giants) this week. Although Ridley has produced of late, a brutal matchup against a Browns coverage unit that entered Week 13 allowing the second-fewest fantasy points per game (FPPG) to WRs raises a red flag, and it's only compounded by the loss of Trevor Lawrence (ankle). London's week-to-week output is way too unpredictable, and with the fantasy season on the line for some of you, there's no reason to roll London out.\nAddison is likely to take a step back with Jefferson back in the fold, while the Packers' receiving situation is too dispersed to put faith into Reed in PPR formats, though he might get a boost with Christian Watson (hamstring) banged up.\nWhat are the biggest WR injuries in Week 14?\nIn Week 13, Demario Douglas (concussion) and Rashid Shaheed (thigh) missed game action, and Tank Dell (leg), Amari Cooper (concussion), Christian Watson (hamstring), and Marquise Brown (heel) exited early from their respective games.\nUPDATE: Christian Kirk suffered a groin injury on Monday night, and he figures to be more doubtful than questionable for this week's game against Cleveland. If he's out, Zay Jones and Tim Jones will see more targets, but with Trevor Lawrence (ankle) also hurt, it's tough to count on either.\nUPDATE: Douglas (concussion) has been ruled OUT for Week 14.\nAs usual, we'll update these WR PPR rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.\nFantasy WR PPR Rankings Week 14: Who to start, sit at wide receiver\nRankings based on full-point PPR scoring formats\nRank Player\n1 Tyreek Hill, Dolphins vs. Titans\n2 CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys vs. Eagles\n3 Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions @ Bears\n4 A.J.

Good luck, check back often, and enjoy the remainder of the first week of December!\nWhich RBs are on bye in Week 14?\nAfter a six-team byepocalypse in Week 13, only the Cardinals and Commanders will be off this coming weekend. That takes lead backs Brian Robinson Jr. and James Conner off the table, plus Antonio Gibson for those in deep leagues.\nWEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nOne thing that stinks for fantasy is that both Washington and Arizona have been defensive turnstiles. Many of the stud running backs have tough matchups in Week 14, but it's only right that many of the elite backs must beat the best defenses to lift fantasy squads to the big dance.\nWEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWho are the best fantasy RBs in Week 14?\nChristian McCaffrey (vs. Seahawks in Week 14) retains his spot at No. 1, especially considering he's playing at home against a Seattle team he just roughed up for 139 yards and two TDs on Thanksgiving. We're also sticking with Austin Ekeler (vs. Broncos) even though he has managed just 2.99 yards per carry since returning from injury just eight games ago. If Denver's abysmal run D doesn't cure what ails him, Ek's getting demoted for the fantasy playoffs.\nTravis Etienne Jr. (@ Browns) draws a tough matchup on paper, but the Rams' Kyren Williams (@ Ravens) might beg to differ. Williams put 112 total yards and a TD on Cleveland in Week 13, and with Etienne's usage rate and the Jags hitting their stride offensively as of late, we're confident in the third-year back's ranking at No. 3.\nWe have two sets of teammates in our top 10 this week: Detroit's David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs (@ Bears) and Miami's Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane (vs. Titans). Both duos have such solid workloads in high-flying, run-first offenses \u2014 and such juicy matchups \u2014 that we can't imagine any of these studs finishing outside the elite eight. DMont and Gibbs combined for 193 yards and two TDs when they faced Chicago in Week 11. Tennessee just surrendered 31 points to Indy, so we know Miami will be dominating the time of possession and running early and often against Will Levis and company.\nJets fans will be hoping for some Breece Lightning from stud second-year back Breece Hall (vs. Texans), and we think they will be rewarded for their patience. Houston has surrendered 111.8 scrimmage yards per game to RBs this season, and DeMeco Ryans' unit has also allowed 14 total rushing TDs on the year. We like Hall's upside even more than we like stud dual-purpose backs Alvin Kamara (vs. Panthers) and Saquon Barkley (vs. Packers), but just barely. Kamara and Barkley both have strong matchups, with Carolina and Green Bay both sitting in the bottom 10 in the NFL in standard fantasy points allowed to RBs.\nWEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nWho are the best fantasy RB sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 14?\nWe'll talk more about Derrick Henry (concussion) in the injury section, but we can say with confidence here and now that Tyjae Spears (@ Dolphins) should be the hottest waiver-wire pickup of Week 14. Tennessee is a run-first offense and King Henry might be sidelined with a head injury, so Spears could very well pick up where he left off against Indy last weekend. The young back averaged 4.7 yards per carry (just shy of his 5.1 YPC entering the week) en route to 88 yards.\nAnother backup getting a boost this week is the Patriots' Ezekiel Elliott (@ Steelers), who will assume lead-back duties after Rhamondre Stevenson went down with a pretty bad ankle injury in Week 13. Zeke might put in a vintage performance considering James Conner just went back to Pittsburgh and hung 105 yards and two TDs on his old squad.\nCould this be the weekend that Keaton Mitchell (vs. Rams) gets back into RB2 range for the Ravens? Los Angeles might find itself spying Lamar Jackson and Gus Edwards so often that the speedy rookie busts a couple of big runs. Mitchell has racked up 330 yards and two TDs since he broke out four games ago, but the majority of that damage (134 yards and a TD) came in the initial breakout against Seattle. He has still yet to see 12 touches in a game, something we can't imagine will be the case by the end of the regular season.\nWe also think Roschon Johnson (vs. Lions) could have a chance to take over lead-back duties in Chicago, as both Khalil Herbert and D'Onta Foreman have battled injuries and inconsistent touches this season. It's a tough matchup, so temper your expectations, but there's some high-floor flex appeal considering Alvin Kamara and Taysom Hill averaged 5.2 yards per touch and found the end zone three times via the ground against Detroit last week.\nWEEK 14 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks\nWho are the biggest potential RB busts in Week 14?\nWe're a tad worried about Buffalo second-year back James Cook (@ Chiefs), as Kansas City's front-seven tends to be stout against speedsters but below-average against power backs. You probably aren't in a position to bench Cook, but don't expect massive numbers from the guy who averaged just 2.7 yards per carry against the Eagles his last time out.\nZach Charbonnet (@ 49ers) faces a tough matchup and has a bruise on his knee, so we don't expect very fruitful results from the rookie if he starts in Santa Clara this weekend. We also don't love Jerome Ford or Kareem Hunt (vs. Jaguars), as Jacksonville entered Week 12 allowing just 12.3 standard fantasy points per game to RBs (third lowest in the NFL).\nWe say it almost every week, but the song remains the same: don't start Carolina backs Chuba Hubbard or Miles Sanders (@ Saints). It's even worse than usual this week, as New Orleans has a pretty hard-hitting front-seven and the Bayou is no place for below-average offenses.\nWhat are the biggest RB injuries in Week 14?\nTwo-time rushing champ Derrick Henry (head) suffered a huge blow to the head and neck area in Tennessee's Week 13 loss to the Colts, so don't be surprised if the king gives up his throne to Tyjae Spears this week. He immediately left the game and proceeded to the locker room following the hit, and it was confirmed that he would not return with a head injury. It wouldn't make much sense for a four-win team to rush back its franchise player.\nPatriots dual-purpose back Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) suffered an injury on a nasty hip-drop tackle in New England's Week 13 loss to the Chargers. Bill Belichick and company already noted that 'Mondre would miss multiple weeks, so we're bumping Ezekiel Elliott way up against the Steelers.\nD'Andre Swift took a hard hit and exited Philadelphia's game late against the 49ers, but it's tough to know if he's actually hurt or was just kept out because of the lopsided score. If Swift can't go in Week 14 against Dallas, Kenneth Gainwell and Boston Scott will split touches, with Gainwell likely garnering flex value.\nJonathan Taylor underwent thumb surgery last week and is expected to miss a few weeks. Tough for Taylor owners to ride the home stretch of the regular season without JT, but at least they could get him back for the end of the fantasy playoffs. The injury highlights the importance of handcuffs, as Zack Moss has put up multiple top-10 performances with and without Taylor this season.\nSeattle's Kenneth Walker III (oblique) missed Week 12 and 13, and we're not confident in his ability to suit up against the hard-hitting 49ers coming off a big win in Philly. Backup Zach Charbonnet exited early because of a knee injury against the Cowboys, putting his status in doubt, too. If both are out, DeeJay Dallas would start and lead the backfield in touches.\nGreen Bay's Aaron Jones has a sprained MCL, and sources have revealed that the Packers continue to consider him week-to-week. He only logged four carries before sustaining the injury in Week 11, then he sat for the Packers' Thanksgiving Day tilt with the Lions and their Sunday Night Football win over Kansas City. Why rush him back if Green Bay is already winning games?\nD'Onta Foreman (ankle) missed Chicago's game before the bye, and his status remains unclear heading into Week 14. If he's healthy, he'll likely start in Chicago's backfield, but it's anyone's guess how carries will be divvied up after Roschon Johnson surprisingly led the way in Week 12.\nWe'll be updating these standard RB rankings all week, so check back for the latest player movement.\nFantasy RB Rankings Week 14: Who to start, sit at running back\nRankings based on standard, non-PPR scoring\nRank Player\n1 Christian McCaffrey, 49ers vs. Seahawks\n2 Austin Ekeler, Chargers vs. Broncos\n3 Travis Etienne, Jaguars @ Browns\n4 David Montgomery, Lions @ Bears\n5 Raheem Mostert, Dolphins vs. Titans\n6 De'Von Achane, Dolphins vs. Titans\n7 Breece Hall, Jets vs. Texans\n8 Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions @ Bears\n9 Alvin Kamara, Saints vs. Panthers\n10 Saquon Barkley, Giants vs. Packers\n11 Tony Pollard, Cowboys vs. Eagles\n12 Bijan Robinson, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n13 Derrick Henry, Titans @ Dolphins\n14 Kyren Williams, Rams @ Ravens\n15 Josh Jacobs, Raiders vs. VIkings\n16 Rachaad White, Buccaneers @ Falcons\n17 Joe Mixon, Bengals vs. Colts\n18 D'Andre Swift, Eagles @ Cowboys\n19 Javonte Williams, Broncos @ Chargers\n20 Kenneth Walker III, Seahawks @ 49ers\n21 Jaylen Warren, Steelers vs. Patriots\n22 Jerome Ford, Browns vs. Jaguars\n23 Alexander Mattison, Vikings @ Raiders\n24 Najee Harris, Steelers vs. Patriots\n25 Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots @ Steelers\n26 Gus Edwards, Ravens vs. Rams\n27 James Cook, Bills @ Chiefs\n28 Zack Moss, Colts @ Bengals\n29 Keaton Mitchell, Ravens vs. Rams\n30 AJ Dillon, Packers @ Giants\n31 Dameon Pierce, Texans @ Jets\n32 Aaron Jones, Packers @ Giants\n33 Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Chiefs vs. BIlls\n34 Jerick McKinnon, Chiefs vs. Bills\n35 Roschon Johnson, Bears vs. Lions\n36 Tyjae Spears, Titans @ Dolphins\n37 Kareem Hunt, Browns vs. Jaguars\n38 Tyler Allgeier, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n39 Chuba Hubbard, Panthers @ Saints\n40 D'Onta Foreman, Bears vs. Lions\n41 Devin Singletary, Texans @ Jets\n42 Dalvin Cook, Jets vs. Texans\n43 Zach Charbonnet, Seahawks @ 49ers\n44 Chase Brown, Bengals vs. Colts\n45 D'Ernest Johnson, Jaguars @ Browns\n46 Miles Sanders, Panthers @ Saints\n47 Joshua Kelley, Chargers vs. Broncos\n48 Royce Freeman, Rams @ Ravens\n49 Jaleel McLaughlin, Broncos @ Chargers\n50 Jeff Wilson Jr., Dolphins vs. Titans\n51 Ty Chandler, Vikings @ Raiders\n52 Justice Hill, Ravens vs. Rams\n53 Khalil Herbert, Bears vs. Lions\n54 Latavius Murray, Bills @ Chiefs\n55 Cordarrelle Patterson, Falcons vs. Buccaneers\n56 Kenneth Gainwell, Eagles @ Cowboys\n57 Tank Bigsby, Jaguars @ Browns\n58 Rico Dowdle, Cowboys vs. Eagles\n59 Samaje Perine, Broncos @ Chargers\n60 Matt Breida, Giants vs. Packers\n61 Chase Edmonds, Buccaneers @ Falcons\n62 Boston Scott, Eagles @ Cowboys\n63 Jamaal Williams, Saints vs. Panthers\n\nThis article, authored by Sloan Piva, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-07 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":198}

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\nStartups exist to solve complex problems, not to be a quick moneymaking scheme, and their success lies in their unique value proposition. The harder the problem a startup is tackling, the stronger their competitive advantage and the more indispensable they become in their industry. Simple solutions are easily replicated, risking the startup\u2019s position and success.\nThe key to a successful startup lies in its team and their ability to answer pivotal questions about the startup\u2019s purpose and challenges. Working on a difficult startup problem can bring industry recognition, ease sales and marketing efforts, and open the door to charging more for your premium product. In short: If startup seems like an easy win, the founders are likely overlooking something, I argue in my most recent column. Solve something that could at first seem impossible, and you may be on the right path. If there isn\u2019t a very real chance of failure, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\nOn that lighthearted rant, here\u2019s what\u2019s been cookin\u2019 in the world of startups at TechCrunch this week!\nSomeone call security\nIf you haven\u2019t been paying attention to what our cybersecurity team has been covering, you have been missing out. Zack, Lorenzo, and Carly are absolutely crushing it. Allow me to make an impassioned plea for not missing their work.\nWhen you think \u201cessential services,\u201d you might think water, electricity, and hospitals \u2014 but internet connectivity is increasingly important as the infrastructure that ties together the fabric of society. As the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, internet connectivity in Gaza took a severe hit. Palestinian internet service provider NetStream reportedly collapsed due to a severe shortage of fuel supplies, while other providers such as Paltel and Mada Al Arab are also facing serious connectivity issues. Although the situation remains precarious, connectivity eventually was partially restored. There are indications that the U.S. government is putting pressure on Israel to restore internet connectivity in Gaza.\nMeanwhile in India, Apple has notified several prominent Indian lawmakers and journalists of potential state-sponsored attacks on their iPhones, just months ahead of the country\u2019s general elections. The individuals targeted include opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, key Congress party figure Shashi Tharoor, and leaders from several other influential political parties.\nAtlassian issued a warning about a critical security flaw that could result in significant data loss for its customers. Notably, this product was recently the target of Chinese state-sponsored hackers. Atlassian has not yet detailed how the flaw can lead to data loss but has urged customers to patch against the flaw immediately.\nThere\u2019s more:\nAbout flippin\u2019 time, too: Apple has recently fixed a longstanding vulnerability in its iOS software that undermined a privacy feature. Security researchers found that the feature, introduced in iOS 14, was not working as intended.\n$400 million security acquisition: At a time when the tech industry in Israel is disrupted due to political events, Palo Alto Networks is acquiring Israeli tech company Dig Security for an estimated $400 million. This acquisition will bolster Palo Alto\u2019s cloud security-focused Prisma business.\nI guess we gotta pay up: Paying off hackers in the event of a ransomware attack is pretty common practice, but it comes with a ton of pitfalls: You are trusting anonymous criminals to do what they promised, and you may potentially be violating U.S. sanctions laws along the way.\nWhat\u2019s brewing on the silicon farm?\nApple\u2019s \u201cScary Fast\u201d October event saw the announcement of their new M3 chip lineup that includes M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips, which were the highlight of the event, will be integrated into the new 24-inch iMac and the new MacBook Pros. The focus of the M3 chips is enhanced graphical capabilities. Compared to the previous M1 chip, Apple asserts that the M3 renders at 2.5 times the speed and has a CPU that is 30% faster. The event\u2019s videos looked great (of course they did \u2014 they were produced by Apple), but one delightful quirk was that they were all shot on iPhones, showing off that the phones are becoming more and more capable, even for professional work.\nMagic Leap, an augmented reality hardware company, has replaced its CEO Peggy Johnson with Ross Rosenberg, marking the completion of its enterprise pivot.

The trend points toward a favorable environment for startups prioritizing growth over cash preservation.\nAt the same time, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if WeWork ends up filing for bankruptcy (TC+). The company has been grappling with significant challenges. WeWork\u2019s stock hit a new low, dropping over 47% after hours to just $1.21, which brings the company\u2019s market cap down to a mere $121 million.

The Chiefs took the lead on a field goal early in the final frame and a crucial turnover from Jets QB Zach Wilson eventually decided the fate of the game as Kansas City did not give the ball back to earn the win, 23-20.\nChiefs star QB Patrick Mahomes did not have his best game \u2014 throwing for just 200 yards and one touchdown to two interceptions \u2014 but he made clutch plays in the game's biggest moments to come away with a victory. Wilson had one of his best games as a pro, throwing for 245 yards and two touchdowns.\nDespite the commotion surrounding Taylor Swift's attendance, Travis Kelce had a relatively quiet game with six receptions for 60 yards.

The Chiefs are going to come away with a tightly contested victory.\n11:13 p.m.: We have hit the two-minute warning. The Jets burned all of their timeouts and the Chiefs have the ball on the NYJ 11 facing a 3rd & 8.

Kansas City takes over from its own 12 yard line with 7:28 to play in the third.\n10:19 p.m.: The Jets have all the momentum now. The Chiefs go three-and-out after Patrick Mahomes failed to connect with WR Marques Valdes-Scantling on a deep pass on 3rd & 16. New York will take over from its own 47 yard line after an 11-yard punt return from Xavier Gipson.\nChiefs 20, Jets 20\n10:14 p.m.: TWO-POINT CONVERSION. Zach Wilson scrambled and dove into the end zone to complete the attempt. We have a tied ball game.\n10:13 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Zach Wilson to Allen Lazard on a 10-yard pass.

The Jets QB threw a dart to Garrett Wilson for 14 yards, followed by a 39-yard bomb to Allen Lazard to bring New York into Kansas City territory.\nChiefs 17, Jets 2\n9:09 p.m.: SAFETY! The Jets get on the board by way of a face mask penalty on Chiefs RT Jawaan Taylor in the end zone.\n9:05 p.m.: Zach Wilson connected with Ty Conklin for an 11-yard gain, but the Jets TE was still five yards short of the first down marker.

Patrick Mahomes finds TE Noah Gray wide open for a 34-yard TD to give the Chiefs a 17-0 lead. With too much attention on star TE Travis Kelce, Gray was able to escape free for his first touchdown of the season.\n8:47 p.m.: Jets RB Breece Hall ran for an 11-yard first down on the first play of the drive, but that was all New York's offense could put together. Zach Wilson's throw to TE Ty Conklin fell incomplete on 3rd & 1, forcing the Jets to punt again. The Chiefs will take over at their own 11 yard line with 6:12 to play in the first quarter.\nChiefs 10, Jets 0\n8:40 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Isiah Pacheco hardly even gets touched on a 48-yard carry for the first touchdown of the game. Chiefs' offensive lineman Trey Smith threw an incredible block as a pulling guard, clearing a runway for Pacheco to waltz into the end zone.\n8:34 p.m.: That's a quick three-and-out for the Jets' offense. New York came out throwing but Zach Wilson could only connect on one of three attempts to star WR Garrett Wilson. The Chiefs will take over from their own 31 yard line with 10:35 to play in the first.\nChiefs 3, Jets 0\n8:28 p.m.: FIELD GOAL. Harrison Butker gets the Chiefs on the board with a 37-yarder.

{"title":"Prop Betting - What is a Prop Bet?","context":"## Prop Betting - What is a Prop Bet?\n\nProp bets are easy to understand and add a twist to most sporting events as you can bet on in-game events not tied to the outcome.\nProp bets are popular throughout the year and are posted for every major sport, but the pinnacle for prop betting is the Super Bowl. It\u2019s the most popular day of the year for prop bets, which range from the typical to the exotic.\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait for the Super Bowl to get involved in prop betting. See below for more on props, including the pros, cons, and prop bet examples from all the major sports.\nWhat is a prop bet?\nA prop bet is a \u201cside bet\u201d with a sportsbook on a specific event or statistical accomplishment within the game. These rarely have anything to do with the outcome of a game itself.\nFor example, you might bet on:\nLeBron James scoring over 20 points in a single game\nDallas Cowboys gaining over 300 receiving yards in a game\nPros and cons of prop bets\nEvery bet has positives and negatives, and prop bets are no different.\nPros\nThe lines don\u2019t usually move as fast as other bet types: Prop bet odds are developed based on game lines and totals at sportsbooks, but prop bet lines tend to adjust more slowly. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re keeping an eye on the New York Jets vs. the Buffalo Bills, and you see the total shift due to an incoming winter storm. While many bettors will scramble to get their bet in on the \u2018under\u2019 before the lines move too much, it\u2019s a good idea to scope out the prop bets for individual players. The main lines are shifting, but most of the best sports betting sites don\u2019t have the personnel to keep tabs on every possible player, so you could find value in an \u2018under\u2019 on a quarterback\u2019s passing yards because the lines haven\u2019t caught up yet.\nProp bet odds are developed based on game lines and totals at sportsbooks, but prop bet lines tend to adjust more slowly.

There\u2019s greater variety: The three main bet types\u2014moneylines, point spreads, and totals\u2014are constant in every major sport, but they don\u2019t offer a lot in the way of variety. Prop bets do. They can add interest to a game that may seem one-sided in the major markets. Larger sporting events, especially the Super Bowl, offer a massive variety of bets, ranging from the typical to the exotic and everything in between.\nThe three main bet types\u2014moneylines, point spreads, and totals\u2014are constant in every major sport, but they don\u2019t offer a lot in the way of variety. Prop bets do. They can add interest to a game that may seem one-sided in the major markets. Larger sporting events, especially the Super Bowl, offer a massive variety of bets, ranging from the typical to the exotic and everything in between. They are usually very easy to understand: Prop bets tend to ask a question of the bettor. Will a specific player hit a home run? Will Team X have over\/under 3.5 field goals in a game? Will Team Y give up a powerplay goal? Whatever the question, prop bets are fairly easy to understand for the newcomer.\nCons\nProps are difficult to research: Prop bets are so specific you\u2019d think it would be easier to research them than other bet types, but the reality is that sports are extremely volatile. You can never truly predict how an athlete or a team will perform. This makes it very hard to nail down smart prop bets. For example, you could bet on a certain player to score \u2018over\u2019 a point threshold, but you lose because that player had an off-night, even though they might have easily won that bet in other recent games.\nProp bets are so specific you\u2019d think it would be easier to research them than other bet types, but the reality is that sports are extremely volatile.

Use most of your budget on more stable bet types, such as moneylines, spreads, or totals. Focus only a small percentage of your bankroll on props.\nWe wouldn\u2019t recommend using prop bets as your main bet type when building your strategy. Use most of your budget on more stable bet types, such as moneylines, spreads, or totals. Focus only a small percentage of your bankroll on props. Exotic props are a guessing game: When large events like the Super Bowl roll around, you\u2019ll be inundated with exotic and entertaining prop bets. These are almost impossible to research, and pure guessing isn\u2019t good for anyone\u2019s bankroll or betting strategy.\nProp bet examples for major sports\nEvery major sport with odds at the best sports betting apps will have prop bets. Below, we give examples of prop bets you might find when betting on major American sports.\nNBA prop bets\nThe NBA offers a wide range of prop bets. They vary from player to team bets and lean heavily on the statistical side of the game. Some NBA prop examples include:\nHow many points a player will score\nNumber of assists or three-pointers a player will have\nWhich player will score the first basket of a game\nYou can also bet on team props, such as whether a team will lead at the end of a certain quarter or an over\/under bet on the total number of points the team will score in the game.\nSee more: NBA prop bets\nNFL prop bets\nThe National Football League is the king of sports betting, and NFL betting sites have no qualms about showcasing every kind of possible bet type for it.\nBettors will find many prop bet opportunities, especially for the Super Bowl. During the regular season, one of the most popular prop bet options includes the \u201canytime touchdown scorer\u201d bet, where you can wager on a player to score a TD at any point in the game. Other prop bets can be focused on the team or even both teams.\nSee more: Super Bowl prop bets\nMLB prop bets\nMLB betting sites are no exception when it comes to offering prop bets. Like the other sports, MLB has prop bets focused primarily on individual players and statistical achievements like home runs, RBI, and strikeouts.\nYou might bet on an over\/under for strikeouts for a starting pitcher in a game or even the number of bases a hitter will reach.\nNHL prop bets\nNHL betting sites have all of the props you\u2019d expect from one of the major North American sports leagues, such as player assists or a certain player scoring a goal in a contest.\nYou will also find bets for shots on goal, team goals in a game, and which team will score first.\nMLS prop bets\nThe demand for Major League Soccer betting has increased as the sport's popularity continues growing nationwide. Prop bets are just one of the many bet types growing at sportsbooks to keep up with the demand.\nAs expected, these prop bets often focus on individual players and their accomplishments, such as scoring a goal or collecting an assist in a game. Soccer betting sites also have props such as how many cards the two teams playing will combine to draw or a team\u2019s total number of corner kicks.\nHow to read prop bet odds\nProp bets at US sportsbooks use the same odds as other major bet types like moneylines, point spreads, and totals. These odds, known as American odds, use negative and positive numbers to show you how much money you stand to win.\nPositive odds show how much you stand to win for every $100 you wager. Let's say you wager on a quarterback to have over 2.5 touchdowns in a game at +145 odds, and he throws three in the game. If you wagered $100, you would be paid $245, your initial wager of $100 returned to you, plus $145 in winnings.\nNegative odds tell you how much you need to wager to win $100. For example, if you bet a player will score less than 15.5 points in a basketball game at -135 odds, you would need to bet $135 to win $100.\nRemember that you don\u2019t have to wager that high or that low. Your payout will be calculated proportionally to your wager size when you finalize your bet slip.\nWhat is an exotic prop bet?\nAn exotic prop bet is a non-traditional prop bet that is not focused on scenarios during a game. Instead, they can be as out of the ordinary as the sportsbook wants.\nIn the US, the most exotic bets are available during the Super Bowl, which is the most prominent sports betting day of the year and offers up hundreds of prop bets to interested bettors.\nThese bets can range from the number of songs sung during the halftime show to the result of the coin toss to the color of the sports drink dumped on the winning coach at the end of the game.\nFor the most part, you won\u2019t come across too many exotic prop bets when using US sportsbooks, as many are just not legal bets. However, the largest sporting events, such as the Super Bowl or March Madness, will find sportsbooks offering up a wider range of prop bets. That\u2019s usually when you\u2019ll find more exotic props.\nSportsbook rules for prop bets\nBefore placing any kind of bet, we highly recommend you read the sportsbook\u2019s terms and conditions. There, you will find all the rules for the various bets you will make.\nWhile most sportsbooks\u2019 rules are similar, there are always small variations in how they handle certain situations that could impact your bets.\nOne rule that is typically used by most sportsbooks involves player props. If you bet on a player and they don\u2019t play in the game, most sportsbooks void the bet and refund your wager. But if that player is involved in the game even for a single play, then the bet stands.\nWe recommend reading through the T&Cs before placing any wagers so you\u2019re not caught by surprise if an unexpected event should happen.\nRelated Pages:\n\nThis article, authored by Martin Derbyshire, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-06 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":201}

{"title":"Inter Miami season tickets: Lionel Messi demand causes 2024 prices soar to most expensive in world","context":"## Inter Miami season tickets: Lionel Messi demand causes 2024 prices soar to most expensive in world\n\nLionel Messi's arrival at Inter Miami has brought with it a craze for fans to get a glimpse of one of the sport's most talented and legendary players of all time.\nAlong with that skyrocketing attention comes a leap in prices, and sadly the club seems to be passing that cost on to the supporters.\nIn 2024, Inter Miami will sport some of the world's most expensive tickets, rivaling the prices of Champions League giants such as Barcelona, Arsenal, and other massive clubs around Europe, while dwarfing other MLS ticket packages.\nWhile Fox Sports reported the club has an extensive waiting list for 2024 season tickets, the massive increase in price could push out many of the team's most dedicated supporters who have been with the team since its inception in 2020, causing massive turnover in the fanbase.\nA reminder that for most clubs, season-ticket packages include only home league matches, and while members usually get first access to purchase tickets for knockout competitions, those all come at an additional cost.\nInter Miami season tickets: Prices for 2024\nThe pricing structure for 2024 represents an enormous increase over the 2023 costs. The cheapest season ticket in 2023 was $485, but that will jump all the way to $884, which is an increase of 78.8%. There is a discount for fans who renew by October 7.\nMeanwhile, a season ticket in the lower-level midfield club area, which includes upscale food and beverage options, cost $3,600 in 2023 but will now run $7,650 for the 2024 season, an increase of 113%, more than doubling year-over-year.\nInter Miami 2024 season ticket prices\nPrices below courtesy of Inter Miami season ticketing release via the Miami Herald on September 28, 2023. Sections 2 through B are considered \"premium\" seating, while C through L are considered \"standard.\"\nCode Section Price 2 Mid Loge $45,900 3 North Loge $42,840 4 South Loge $42,840 5 Midfield Club $7,650 6 East Field Seats $13,005 A Northwest Prime $5,440 B Northwest Midfield $4,420 C West Sideline $2,720 D West Reserved $2,380 E East Midfield $2,635 F East Upper Midfield $2,125 G East Sideline $1,955 H East Reserved $1,360 I North Goaline $1,054 J South Goaline $1,020 K South Stand $867 L North Stand Reserved $884\nInter Miami season tickets among most expensive in world for 2024\nWith the Inter Miami season-ticket cost increasing by a huge margin over its own pricing model from 2023 to 2024, the club now boasts some of the most expensive seats in world football, also rivaling that of other major sports in the U.S.\nThe cheapest season ticket for Inter Miami in 2024 is $867, which works out to $51 per match across the 17 home games in the upcoming MLS season. Meanwhile, a seat in the West Reserved section, which puts a fan in the upper deck near the middle of the pitch, is now priced at a whopping $140 per match.\nAccording to Telemundo, this makes Inter Miami one of the most expensive tickets in the entire world. The cheapest Barcelona season ticket, for example, can be had for $377 for the season. Even while their prices are muted thanks to the next few seasons being played outside the under-construction Camp Nou, they are still just 25% cheaper than tickets to Barcelona's famed home ground.\nOne of Europe's most expensive tickets can be found at Tottenham, thanks in part to the brand new state-of-the-art Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and even then its cheapest ticket is around $974, while its most expensive package comes out to $2,498 for the year.\nThe most expensive premium packages at Inter Miami in 2024, which will run supporters over $45,000, dwarf any of the most luxurious tickets in the Premier League. The most expensive season ticket in the EPL can be found at Fulham, where the Craven Cottage luxury booths are valued at $3,620. Barcelona's most expensive season ticket is $1,826 for the full year.\nThe National Football League (NFL), the most popular sport in the United States by a massive margin, boasted an average ticket price of $112 in 2022, while the average NBA ticket price was $94 that year.\nThese prices also dwarf many other clubs in Major League Soccer. Orlando City SC, one of Inter Miami's chief in-state rivals, have their cheapest season ticket available for just $324 in 2024, over half the cost of any Inter Miami season ticket, while their most expensive premium ticket costs $2,898. Meanwhile, another nearby rival, Atlanta United, will feature its cheapest season ticket for $605 in 2024, or just $525 for founding members.\nInter Miami season-ticket glitch causes scare\nAlready, price increases have Inter Miami season ticket holders on edge, but a computer glitch saw supporters fed an even bigger scare.\nMike Ryan, a Miami local who regularly appears on the radio program The Dan LeBatard Show, posted on social media his shock when he received a 2024 renewal for $30,600 for his two seats, which in 2023 cost just $6,802. Ryan then posted a follow-up a few hours later that stated he was contacted by Inter Miami representatives who indicated that pricing was incorrect thanks to a computer glitch that sent supporters quotes for additional seats they did not actually have.\nStill, Ryan's follow-up indicated that his error quote was doubled in price over the actual cost, which still leaves his seats increasing from around $6,800 to a whopping $15,300 for two seats, an increase of 125% year-on-year.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Bonn, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-04 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":203}

{"title":"England choose survival over oblivion and a chance of summer trip to France | Jonathan Liew","context":"## England choose survival over oblivion and a chance of summer trip to France | Jonathan Liew\n\nThey\u2019ll always have Paris. Throughout this Nations League campaign this has been an England team fighting its own sense of entropy, still giving everything, still trying the same plans and processes in the hope that eventually something would click. And at 9.34pm on a briskly cold Wembley night, it finally did. Ella Toone\u2019s injury-time goal earned England three points and kept their faintly glowing Olympic dream alive. But somehow it also did so much more.\nIt breathed life into a team and a cycle, and a moment that for so much of the evening had felt like it was drawing to its natural conclusion provided a rousing encore to a cast preparing for its final curtain. There will be new challenges and new frontiers to conquer soon enough, a fresh set of European Championship qualifiers in the spring, but for now this iteration of the Lionesses still has tricks up its sleeve, still has talent and creativity to burn, still has a fire that can scorch any team on the planet.\nAnd as they rallied so spectacularly to salvage a match that looked cooked after 35 minutes, running on fumes and adrenaline, sustained by the sizzle of the Wembley crowd, the cold air on their skin and the flickering candle of qualification for Paris next summer, it was as if a kind of energy was surging within them.\nAn energy that we have not really glimpsed from them since they reassembled this autumn, barely a month on from the trauma of Sydney, still a little dazed and concussed.\nBeth Mead came on for Chloe Kelly at half-time, Georgia Stanway moved further forward and made herself a menace in the penalty area, and the old buddies Toone and Alessia Russo teamed up off the bench. The Dutch retreated further and further into Wembley\u2019s wide open spaces, giving Lauren James the time and territory to dictate. James had a hand in all three goals, and as Toone ghosted in at the far post to provide the final flourish, Wembley screeched out one last call to arms, one last push, one last effort.\nFor all this, it is probably worth pointing out that for large parts of the game England were not very good. And we were reminded that for all their creativity and verve going forward perhaps the biggest flaw in this side is a lack of presence in the two penalty areas, the physicality and the alpha energy to do the grunt work, to convert the crosses and to head them away.\nJess Carter had a poor game and was withdrawn for Esme Morgan after half-time, Alex Greenwood over-committed for the first Dutch goal and even the all-conquering Mary Earps plummeted to Earth with a poor first-half error.\nBut beyond personnel, a basic brittleness seems to have crept into this team, a sense of melting surfaces and cracks in the ice. Sarina Wiegman talks a lot about defending against counterattacks, because this is basically the key to the whole enterprise. Cut off the counter, and with England\u2019s technical quality they can easily dominate. It is also the essential measure of how the team is functioning as a collective: the efficiency of the press, the closing of the angles, the command of space. Lineth Beerensteyn\u2019s two goals were the sort England simply were not conceding four months ago.\nMary Earps shows her frustration after conceding a second goal to the Netherlands. Photograph: Tom Jenkins\/The Guardian\nSo England passed the ball around a bit and gave it away a bit and essentially ran around trying to feel normal again, and on countless occasions Kelly or Hemp would win a first or second ball, look up and see a penalty area empty of white shirts. These are issues not so much of tactics but cohesion and energy: the timing of runs, the sharpness required not just to anticipate where the ball is going to be, but actually get there. You can still chase when you\u2019re running on fumes, but to create: this needs an idea and a vision, the clarity of mind to see the picture before it has materialised.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women\u2019s football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How much prestige should we really attach to the Nations League, anyway? Is it primarily an Olympic qualification shootout or something worth winning in its own right? England ended up trying to answer these questions on the hoof, and somehow it was only when their options had finally clarified down to one \u2013 survival or oblivion \u2013 that they recovered their poise and verve.\nThis entire post-pandemic international cycle \u2013 a Euros, a World Cup, an Olympics and another Euros squeezed into three years \u2013 feels like a kind of sadism dressed up as a panorama of opportunity. There is a school of thought out there that a fallow summer might not have been the worst thing for this team: time to reflect and process, time to breathe, time to refresh.\nInstead, they now travel to Glasgow on Tuesday for one last push. The minds are still frazzled. The bodies are screaming. But chaos and confusion has never felt quite so sweet.\n\nThis article, authored by Jonathan Liew at Wembley, was published by The Guardian on 2023-12-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":206}

This echoed Collingwood defender and Fox Footy commentator Ruby Schleicher\u2019s thoughts at the time, who called it a \u201cmonster tackle\u201d but believed it was \u201cfair\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t see any dirtiness in that,\u201d Schleicher said on Fox Footy. \u201cIt was pretty heavy on her head, wasn\u2019t it?

The duty of care for the player.\u201d\nThe decision a week comes after Adelaide premiership defender Najwa Allen was handed a three-ban suspension, the longest ban in AFLW history, for a high bump on Western Bulldog Kirsten McLeod.

Michael Prior guided West Coast to a gutsy win. Credit: Getty\nAisling McCarthy and Amy Franklin drew first blood for West Coast within the opening five minutes, while the hosts were kept goalless. The Bombers only added three behinds in the second term and the Eagles failed to score as the blustery conditions took their toll on the game. West Coast\u2019s Kellie Gibson broke the goal drought with the only major of the third quarter, before the home side came to life with the wind at their backs in the final term, with skipper Bonnie Toogood and Amber Clarke reducing the margin to four points. Toogood continued to pepper the scoreboard, but the Eagles held on to secure a rare victory. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a horror week back at home, and it\u2019s been really bloody tough on all of us, and Mick as well. I\u2019m just really proud of the girls,\u201d West Coast captain Emma Swanson said post-game on the broadcast. \u201cI can name the whole team. Everyone had their second in the last couple minutes.\n\u201cThat was such a team effort, everyone had a moment there when they had to put their head over the footy and lay a tackle and not let it slip.\u201d Swanson (25 disposals, eight clearances) stood out for the Eagles, while Bombers workhorse Maddy Prespakis (30 disposals, nine clearances) was typically prominent in the midfield alongside Georgia Nanscawen (21, six).

AAP Pies hold on against comeback Cats\nSunday\u2019s clash between Collingwood and Geelong at Victoria Park was less about who was the overall better side than it was decided by who could adapt best to the blustery wind and rain. The answer: the Magpies. Collingwood survived a fourth quarter comeback from Geelong to finish with a six-point victory and stay firmly in finals contention, whereas the Cats now face an uphill battle to finish in the eight in two weeks\u2019 time.

We train what scenarios to do in what moments, and even though it\u2019s a bit crazy, it felt so calm.

Ella Friend slotted a much-needed goal for the visitors to make it 4.2 (26) to 1.3 (9) at quarter-time. With less than a minute till the long break, captain Hayley Miller (two goals) kicked the only major of the second quarter to give Fremantle a comfortable 26-point lead at half-time.

They next play 17th-placed West Coast and then top-four side North Melbourne. For the Swans, however, the victory has them challenging for a top-eight spot alongside the likes of Gold Coast, Geelong, Collingwood, St Kilda and Carlton.\nThe Swans, who went winless in their debut season last year, were propelled to victory by a Chloe Molloy masterclass.

The total was also the biggest the Dogs have conceded in their history, topping the 83 Melbourne kicked against them in round three. Molloy, the Swans\u2019 star off-season recruit, turned on one of the best performances of her career to demolish their injury-hit hosts.\nThe former Collingwood ace was a class above as she kicked 3.4 from her 28 possessions and played a crucial role in setting up numerous other Sydney goals. Loading \u201cShe [Molloy] was itching to get in there [in the midfield],\u201d Swans coach Scott Gowans said. \u201cWe kept her forward deliberately. It was important Chloe played a good block of time forward so we could have a look at it.\u201d The Blues lost to Greater Western Sydney by two points on Saturday afternoon, denying them the chance to leapfrog into the top eight, 8.1 (49) to 7.5 (47).\nNarrm reclaim top spot Reigning premiers Narrm have reclaimed top spot on the ladder and their position as flag favourites after defeating third-placed North Melbourne by 23 points at Ikon Park on Saturday night.

But Narrm controlled more of the game by tightening around the contest and being cleaner going forward. They also defended extremely well by suffocating the opportunities North created and prevailed 5.7 (37) to 2.2 (14). While the Demons scored just one goal a quarter in the second half \u2013 Tyla Hanks in the third and Eden Zanker in the fourth \u2013 the Kangaroos were goalless for three terms, having led by five points at the first change. Their opening goals were thanks to Niamh Martin and Tess Craven.\nThen a crafty goal from Demons skipper Kate Hore to open the second term put her side up, and Melbourne never gave up the lead. Hanks was pivotal for the Demons and starred with 26 disposals, seven tackles and one goal, while her partner in the midfield Olivia Purcell had 28 touches, five clearances and five tackles.

Credit: Getty Images Separated by one point at half-time and down by nine points entering the last quarter, the Tigers pulled off a 6.5 (41) to 4.6 (30) victory to keep their finals hopes alive at Cazaly\u2019s Stadium in Cairns on Friday night.\nHawthorn were limited to just one point in the decisive final quarter. Midfield duo Monique Conti (35 disposals, seven clearances) and Grace Egan (28, 5) were typically influential for Richmond, while Hawthorn were led by Emily Bates (18, four) and Jasmine Fleming (18, one). \u201cRichmond were just absolute beasts, especially their midfielders. They really worked hard all night,\u201d Hawthorn coach Bec Goddard said after the game. \u201cOur work rate really dropped off and we just watched them play some really good footy. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Hawks fan, you would\u2019ve seen some really exciting moments of footy tonight.\n\u201cKeep getting excited. We are coming, we\u2019re growing, we\u2019re getting better.\u201d Hawthorn\u2019s Irish ace Aine McDonagh kicked the opening goal before Tigers skipper Katie Brennan slotted two unanswered majors to celebrate her 50th game in style. Fellow 50-gamer Greta Bodey put boot to ball to snatch her own goal before quarter-time. A skirmish erupted in the second term after Brennan took exception to a tackle by Mattea Breed on Laura McClelland. McClelland was gifted a 50-metre penalty following a bump against Sarah Hosking by Sophie Locke and converted from inside the goal square while players were occupied by the tussle.\nBridie Hipwell kicked the only goal of the third quarter to give Hawthorn a game-high nine-point lead. Loading Richmond rebounded in the last term, with Courtney Jones ending Hawthorn\u2019s three-goal run with her first touch of the night, cutting the margin to three points. Dogged by inaccuracy in front of goal, Yassir reduced the deficit to a single point before finally breaking through on her third attempt. That put the Tigers ahead by six points with 11 minutes left, before Caitlin Greiser sealed the win with a massive goal from 45 metres.\n\nThis article, authored by , was published by The Age on 2023-10-20 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":208}

With only 0.4 of a percentage point separating Sydney in ninth and St Kilda in eighth, the win assured the Swans of retaking eighth spot. If the Saints had qualified, it would have been their maiden finals appearance. Saints goalkicker Jesse Wardlaw had a heavy collision with Carlton\u2019s Keeley Sherar late in the final quarter of their clash.\nGeorgia Patrikios showed her class in the do-or-die match, collecting 25 disposals and eight contested possessions in a powerhouse display, while Hannah Priest was a brick wall in defence, with nine intercept possessions. Abbie McKay worked overtime to counter Patrikios in the midfield, but her side was outclassed across the park. McKay racked up 28 disposals and 12 clearances alongside Mimi Hill (30 disposals), while defender Sherar (17) toiled against a potent Saints attack. Meanwhile, Sydney prevailed in a fierce tug-of-war with the Dockers to seal their first AFLW finals appearance. Down by four points at half-time in the low-scoring game, a third-term goal from Rebecca Privitelli sparked the Swans to a 5.10 (40) to 2.6 (18) win on Sunday at Fremantle Oval.\nThe second-year expansion side stormed home with three unanswered goals to secure eighth spot. It\u2019s a dramatic improvement, with the Swans winless in their first season. \u201cAny club that\u2019s able to go from winless one year to a finals berth, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d Sydney co-captain Chloe Molloy told Fox Footy after the match. \u201cYou can see the emotion on the girls\u2019 faces. Coming into the season, the odds were against us. Just to get into the eight, we\u2019ve managed to do that. We\u2019re stoked. It\u2019s pretty special for the club.\u201d Missing star ruck Ally Morphett to a season-ending wrist injury, Laura Gardiner stood the tallest in the midfield, while Molloy (two goals), Montana Ham, Privitelli and Brooke Lochland hit the scoreboard.

The Lions put on a show across the park, with powerhouse duo Ally Anderson (22 disposals) and Jade Ellenger (22) going to work in the midfield while Dakota Davidson (two goals) led the charge in the forward line.

Crumbling under the Brisbane attack, the visitors conceded four unanswered goals from Taylor Smith, Sophie Conway (two goals) and Ruby Svarc while remaining goalless in the third term. Midfield stars Olivia Purcell (14 contested possessions) and Tyla Hanks (11) showed their mettle as they attempted to drag their side over the line, but the Demons were outclassed and sorely missing Paxy Paxman (hamstring). Melbourne could be without Maeve Chaplin in their finals campaign, after the defender sustained a concussion injury in the third term. AAP Cats secure elimination final home-ground advantage\nGeelong have not only secured their spot in the top eight with a huge 40-point win over Hawthorn on Saturday at GMHBA Stadium but locked in home-ground advantage for the first elimination final. The Cats finished sixth, with the 9.6 (60) to 3.2 (20) win over the Hawks boosting their percentage to a healthy 141.2, almost 40 ahead of Essendon, who sit one rung below them on equal points.

Georgie Prespakis (35 touches, eight clearances) and Amy McDonald (23 touches, eight clearances) were a formidable midfield duo, while the retiring Renee Garing had a whopping 11 tackles. Overall, it was a strong team effort from a side that will be hungry for a finals win. Last year, the Cats had an impressive home-and-away run but bowed out narrowly in an elimination final to North Melbourne. Geelong young defender Rebecca Webster told this masthead earlier in the week how important the home crowd is for them come knockout finals. \u201cPlaying at GMHBA is like a massive advantage for us,\u201d said Webster. \u201cWe love going in those four walls.

They will head into finals with momentum but a glaring issue to work on: kicking accuracy. Despite the comfortable win, they could have done a lot more damage after booting double the number of behinds to goals.\nStar midfielder Ash Riddell, who had 36 touches and seven clearances, said she was excited to go up against Melbourne or Adelaide in the first weekend of finals depending on other results this round, as they were the only two sides who beat them this year. \u201cI\u2019m excited like I think the group\u2019s coming together really nicely and where really well-prepared compared to previous years,\u201d Riddell told Fox Footy. \u201cSo, I can\u2019t wait I think it\u2019s an exciting time for us.\u201d The game was one-way traffic against the Dogs with the game played almost entirely in the Roos\u2019 attacking half.

The Dogs have plenty to work on for next season as they look to regain a competitive edge, which was lost after a finals berth last year. Along with being in a rebuild, they were badly injury-hit this season and used 32 players, more than any other club. Suns secure finals spot AAP Unsung hero Lucy Single has helped Gold Coast book their second AFLW finals appearance with a 14-point win over Essendon. Losing midfield powerhouse Charlie Rowbottom to an ankle injury proved no obstacle in the Suns\u2019 maiden clash with the Bombers, as they finished the regular season in fifth spot after a 6.3 (39) to 3.7 (25) victory to kick off pride round at Great Barrier Reef Arena on Friday.\nWhile their men\u2019s side have yet to make a finals appearance, this is the second time Gold Coast\u2019s women have clinched a play-off spot, having also done so in the cancelled 2020 season.

Prespakis was held to eight contested possessions, well below a season average of 14 per game, while Georgia Nanscawen proved a potent threat with 13 contested possessions and three score involvements.\nThe Bombers broke through first with a goal from Amber Clarke but young talent Darcie Davies (two goals) was able to respond after being gifted 50 metres from a protected area infringement by Mia Bush. Daisy D\u2019Arcy, Jacqueline Dupuy, Jamie Stanton and Davies attempted to break away from the low-scoring tug-of-war in the second with goals of their own. But two goals from Amelia Radford and Georgia Gee kept the hosts close, while defender Ellyse Gamble (nine intercept possessions) proved a roadblock for the Suns\u2019 attackers. Single lit up the park with a clinical slice through the corridor, dodging two tackles to put the ball in the hands of Georgia Clayden, who capped the centre clearance with the only major of the third term. With both sides goalless in the final quarter, the Suns were able to cruise home.

After a winless campaign in 2022, the Swans \u2013 led by ex-Collingwood player Chloe Molloy \u2013 have been competitive this season. The team won their first AFLW match in round one and are within a game of the top eight with two rounds to play.\nBut general manager of women\u2019s football at the AFL, Nicole Livingstone, said the Swans\u2019 off-field offering had tapped into something \u201cuniquely Sydney\u201d and helped make matches more attractive.\n\u201cTo go to North Sydney Oval and to have quince paste and hand-picked grapes, cheddar cheese and biscuits in a little box that\u2019s got this beautiful wrapping on it \u2013 they\u2019ve really thought about what they\u2019re doing and made it an experience,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEven at Henson Park [the Swans\u2019 other home ground in Sydney\u2019s gentrified inner west], they\u2019ve gone to microbreweries in the local area and invited them in, but also promoted through their clientele to come to the football.\u201d\nThe Swans forward Bella Smith said the players were proud of the club\u2019s attendance record, and were grateful for the support. \u201cWe get there two hours before the start of the game and the hill [at Henson Park] is bare. When you come out for the first team warm-up, the hill is slowly filling and then by the time the first bounce gets around, it is full,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can hear it, the atmosphere is amazing.\u201d\nThe average attendance for the AFLW is a little over 2,500 a match this year, tracking approximately on par with previous seasons and with a finals uptick likely to come. But crowds are short of targets that could accelerate the extension of the regular season, which grows from 10 games this year to 12 games by 2025.\n5,474 fans were at North Sydney Oval to watch the Swans\u2019 first AFLW victory earlier in the season. Photograph: Jack Snape\/The Guardian\nThe league enjoyed strong attendances in round one, which were partly attributed to the so-called Matildas effect, but some clubs have struggled to attract fans in large numbers this season. Crowds of less than 1,500 have been recorded in both traditional markets such as Melbourne and Perth, as well as areas targeted for growth like Blacktown and the Gold Coast.\nThe A-League Women launched this month with a first round highlighted by a crowd of more than 11,000 in Sydney. But more modest attendances in subsequent games, including two sub-2,000 crowds in Perth, suggest the popularity of the Matildas\u2019 run to the semi-finals has only had a limited impact on support for domestic women\u2019s sport.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Australia Sport Free newsletter Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The effect, according to Livingstone, has been positive.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increased game time by eight minutes per match, on average, and we\u2019ve had record scores across the rounds,\u201d she said. \u201cWhereas leading into the season we hadn\u2019t scored more than 100 goals in a round, we\u2019ve regularly been scoring over 100 goals in a round.\u201d\nThe Swans recorded their highest total last round, in their 14-12-96 to 6-3-39 defeat of the Western Bulldogs, the league\u2019s winless bottom side. Molloy recorded 17 score involvements to set a new AFLW mark.\nBut Livingstone said the AFL was happy with the level of competition. \u201cOur ladder, from position five to 13 \u2013 there\u2019s only a game separating it.

{"title":"\u2018Latin artists have been paving the way for deals that offer more control, transparency, and better economics.\u2019","context":"## \u2018Latin artists have been paving the way for deals that offer more control, transparency, and better economics.\u2019\n\nMBW\u2019s World Leaders is a regular series in which we turn the spotlight toward some of the most influential industry figures overseeing key international markets. In this feature, we speak to Alejandra Olea, Managing Director, Americas at Believe. World Leaders is supported by PPL.\nThere is no mistaking the global music biz\u2019s biggest breakthrough independent hit of the past few months.\nSpanish artist I\u00f1igo Quintero\u2019s Si No Est\u00e1s rose to the top of Spotify\u2018s Global Top 50 in late October \u2013 and has stubbornly refused to leave the upper reaches of digital charts ever since. (Even amongst the early December onslaught of Christmas standards in Spotify\u2019s flagship global chart, the Spanish-language track currently remains comfily snuggled in at No.7.)\nTo date, having only been released on September 23, Si No Est\u00e1s has racked up over 330 million plays on Spotify, and over 100 million on YouTube.\nFrom a music industry perspective, Si No Est\u00e1s is especially interesting because it provided Believe, the Paris-headquartered indie biz giant, with its first-ever chart-topper on Spotify\u2019s Global Top 50.\nI\u00f1igo Quintero \u2013 who last week released his follow-up track. Lo Que Queda de M\u00ed \u2013 was signed to Believe in March via indie label\/aggregator Acqustic.\nThe act\u2019s worldwide success is just part of the story of Believe\u2019s steady growth in Latin music in the past few years, which has been led by Alejandra Olea, the company\u2019s Managing Director, Americas.\nHere, as part of our World Leaders series, Olea discusses the I\u00f1igo Quintero story \u2013 including TikTok\u2019s vital role in the explosion of Si No Est\u00e1s.\nOlea also discusses Believe\u2019s unique position in the growth of Latin music \u2013 and, more generally, how she sees independent artists continually changing the game in the global business\u2026\nWhat has been the story of Inigo\u2019s global hit so far? Where did it come from and how did it explode in 2023?\nBelieve has been working with I\u00f1igo Quintero since March of this year. The success of the track is the result of outstanding teamwork between the artist, his label, Believe and our global digital partners, more specifically Spotify and TikTok in this case.\nIn the initial discovery phase, we developed the audience of the track with the label mostly through Believe\u2019s expertise of marketing on Spotify. Secondly thanks to our short-form video trends detection technology, we noticed some acceleration on the propagation of the track and consequently we leveraged our partnership with TikTok, as well as coordinated promotion from all our teams around the world with Spotify.\nOur global partnerships with both TikTok and Spotify allowed us to combine marketing and promotion campaigns for the track in each service at both local level in key early markets \u2013 Spain, Latin America, France \u2013 as well as globally.\n\u201cOur global partnerships with both TikTok and Spotify allowed us to combine marketing and promotion campaigns for the track in each service at both local level in key early markets.\u201d\nAs a result of the work of our teams all around the world, the track has been included in over 180 playlists across all digital music partners and in over 79 playlists and over 97 million followers on Spotify only, including reaching #1 of Spotify\u2019s Top 50 \u2013 Global, the first time ever for a Believe track, as well as being featured on Spotify\u2019s Today\u2019s Top Hits, Spotify\u2019s biggest playlist, and topping Spotify\u2019s Viral 50 and Top 50 playlists around the world.\nTo this day, our partnership with TikTok has resulted in a total of more than 5 million creations (according to MediaMatch).\nAlong with TikTok on the social side, we have leveraged Instagram to drive engagement around I\u00f1igo and the song globally. Our teams, who have a very robust video expertise to maximize content across platforms, built I\u00f1igo\u2019s YouTube channel from the ground up, optimizing it and directing traffic to it by creating the official lyric video as its first video, so that music fans could find and listen to his music on the platform.\nSince then, the lyric video for Si No Est\u00e1s has reached 100 million views to date. [It\u2019s currently ranked at #13 on YouTube\u2019s Top 100 Global Music Videos.]\nWe are now in a new phase to deepen and expand the success by promoting the track on more traditional media in key countries, where the track is rapidly gaining radio airplay and unlocking other promotional opportunities.\nThe success of Si No Est\u00e1s illustrates very well how much artist development has changed. Social media and digital music services have now become the #1 source of music discovery. Believe has developed an innovative, AI and data-driven expertise to develop tracks and artists that is unique in the music industry.\n\u201cThe success of Si No Est\u00e1s illustrates very well how much artist development has changed. Social media and digital music services have now become the #1 source of music discovery.\u201d\nThe key to success is great partnerships with the artist and his label, and being able to combine strong AI data-driven expertise to maximize momentum for an artist and a track at the right time with the right tools and the right partnerships, supported by both local and global teams.\nThis last element is particularly important, and truly one of Believe\u2019s strengths: being able to mobilize our teams multi-locally and globally to accompany audience development for our artists. We expect this is only the beginning for I\u00f1igo Quintero and also anticipate many more successes like his in the future.\nHow did it end up distributed by Believe via Acqustic?\nBelieve\u2019s strength is our presence across 50 countries around the world. By deploying local teams on the ground, we are fully part of the local music scenes, and are able to identify the labels and artists with the most potential. So locally, our team\u2019s role is to select local artists and labels to partner with and accompany them in their development.\nWe are very selective on our approach as our goal is to provide them, regardless of their level of development, with the highest level of quality of service in the market. In the case of I\u00f1igo, we identified Acqustic as a promising new label in 2020, with a great team, a strong A&R vision and great track record. In March 2023, they signed I\u00f1igo and now Si No Est\u00e1s is the smashing success we know.\nIt\u2019s now all about building upon that success and accompanying the artist and the labels we service in their next phase of growth. This is made possible thanks to Believe\u2019s unique ability to adapt the level of service to the needs of the artist and label: the more successful they become, the more their needs evolve, and the more we are able to provide the best support to supercharge that growth.\nI know Inigo is Spanish, but what would you say is driving the ability of Latin artists (particularly Latin American artists) to date to have global hits on distribution agreements \u2013 without signing (even licensing) deals with major record labels?\nSpanish-speaking music, from Spain and Latin America, just keeps getting bigger. Spanish and Latin artists have much more options to develop their audiences and monetize their music at each stage of their career.\nArtists like I\u00f1igo Quintero and labels like Acqustic are prime examples of this profound shift within the Latin and wider music industry. We are in a world where music discovery and consumption are now primarily digital, and artists have now understood that. They look for partners who get it too and whose expertise will allow them to leverage digital platforms to reach new and existing audiences wherever they are.\n\u201cArtists today are also much more conscious of their career trajectory and look for better deals, with more freedom, more transparency, and more options.\u201d\nThis is especially the case in Spanish-speaking markets, where music fans are amongst the most engaged audiences in the world, whether on digital platforms or on social media. Music content is consumed with more frequency, in different formats, across multiple platforms and through different aspects related to the track.\nBeyond that, artists today are also much more conscious of their career trajectory and look for better deals, with more freedom, more transparency, and more options. They want to keep ownership of their masters, and get better economics.\nThis level of agility is at the very core of Believe\u2019s structuring: from self-releasing services with TuneCore, to more premium services with Believe Label and Artist Solutions or Artist Services Solutions, we pride ourselves for being able to accompany talents like I\u00f1igo at all stages of their development, from being emerging acts, all the way to becoming top charting artists.\nCan we read anything into the fact that Inigo is Spanish, and how the trend identified above (i.e. Latin American artists having hits without being on major record company deals) is starting to spread to different corners of the world and different genres? We just had RAYE enjoying gobal success independently with Escapism, and in the US earlier this year there was of course Oliver Anthony going to No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100\u2026\nFor many years now, Latin artists have been paving the way for deals that bring them more control, transparency, and better economics.\nLooking at the global picture, beyond Spanish-speaking artists, there truly is something bigger at play here. We do see, all around the world, more and more artists able to reach massive levels of success, not only in their own markets, but internationally too, without the need to for major label support and traditional label deals.\nAt Believe, Inigo has of course been a fantastic example of this. But we have also had similar success stories in other markets, notably France, where the Top 5 albums of the week of June 16th where all by artists signed to Believe directly or through their labels.\n\u201cLooking at the global picture, beyond Spanish-speaking artists, there truly is something bigger at play here.\u201d\nElsewhere in Europe, Blanco has been skyrocketing in the UK, while RAF Camora & HoodBlaq in Germany also peaked at #1 in June 2023 in the Official German Album Charts for RAF Camora\u2019s XV RR, a re-edition of his album XV.\nSimilarly, Indonesia\u2019s Nadhif Basalamah\u2019s Penjaga Hati was the #4 global viral song on Spotify in the week of October 16th and Idgitaf peaked at #1 on Spotify\u2019s Viral Charts. And of course, another fantastic example is Regional Mexican powerhouse Grupo Frontera, whose latest album, El Comienzo, released early August, peaked at #1 on Spotify\u2019s Top Album Debut USA, Top Album Debut Global, Top Songs Debut Global and Top Songs Debut USA, with +1.6 billion streams on Spotify to date.\nSo there are indeed more and more artists getting huge amounts of traction and rising to the top of the charts, without traditional major label support. We see this trend getting bigger and bigger and gaining more and more markets.\n\nThis article, authored by Tim Ingham, was published by Music Business Worldwide on 2023-12-07 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":211}
{"title":"Michelle Jubelirer on Ice Spice, The Beatles, and reinventing Capitol Music Group: \u2018I don\u2019t think any label group has been able to turn things around as quickly as my team and I have done in less than two years.\u2019","context":"## Michelle Jubelirer on Ice Spice, The Beatles, and reinventing Capitol Music Group: \u2018I don\u2019t think any label group has been able to turn things around as quickly as my team and I have done in less than two years.\u2019\n\nTwo years ago, this writer sat down for a Chinese meal on a chilly winter\u2019s night in London with Michelle Jubelirer and some of her closest allies at Capitol Music Group.\nJubelirer had just been promoted to Chair and CEO of the Los Angeles-based label group \u2013 a key pillar of Universal Music Group. The mood that night was suitably celebratory\u2026 but it was also, it\u2019s fair to say, imbued with knowledge of a tough road ahead.\nJubelirer was widely tipped as the natural successor to Steve Barnett when the British exec stood down as head of CMG in 2020. She had been by Barnett\u2019s side throughout a run of success at CMG over multiple years \u2013 via artists like Sam Smith, Halsey, Paul McCartney, and Lewis Capaldi, as well as transformative deals like a JV between Motown (then part of CMG) and Quality Control.\nIn actuality, Jubelirer\u2019s immediate ascension to running CMG was not forthcoming. Instead, Barnett was succeeded in December 2020 as Chairman\/CEO of the label group by Jeff Vaughn, a fast-rising exec who\u2019d previously impressed as a data-and-socials-savvy A&R at Mike Caren\u2019s Artist Partner Group (APG).\nMid-pandemic, Vaughn entered CMG with bold ideas, but it didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out there was a culture clash: Within a startlingly short 12 months, Vaughn was gone from CMG. (He has since launched his label JV, Signal Records, with Sony\u2018s Columbia).\nIn the wake of this corporate untidiness, Jubelirer was (some may suggest was overdue-ly) named Chair & CEO of Capitol Music Group. Her most pressing brief? Calm everything the hell down, and get the Good Ship Capitol out of the eye of the hurricane.\nSo, the mood at that Chinese dinner? Understandable.\nYet if some nervous energy was detected that night, so was a healthy confidence. Jubelirer and co. have been putting both to good use ever since.\nTwo years on, Jubelirer\u2019s CMG hasn\u2019t only returned to calmer waters \u2013 with US market share YTD in the high-5% region \u2013 it\u2019s also achieved some glittering successes while priming a promising array of new talent.\nA key example: CMG, along with its colleagues at Capitol UK and the artist\u2019s team, has been behind the Grammy-winning global smash that is Sam Smith\u2019s Unholy (an unapologetically ribald banger from a singer who refuses to be pigeonholed as a sweet balladeer).\nCMG has also been a crucial partner, alongside Elliot Grainge\u2018s 10K Projects, in the rise of Ice Spice. The Best New Artist Grammy nominee has landed with such explosiveness, she\u2019s secured no less than four Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 singles and over 2 billion global streams off her official debut release\u2026 which is an EP.\nJubelirer calls Ice Spice \u201cTHE breakout artist of 2023\u201d, adding: \u201cShe\u2019s the first artist since Olivia Rodrigo to achieve three Top 5 single debuts in her first four months, and she just attained another Top 10 with \u201cBarbie World\u201d with Nicki [Minaj].\n\u201cWe\u2019re just at the beginning of what is going to be a tremendous career of artistry and global popularity.\u201d\nOther priorities at Capitol over the past 12 months have included Tampa-born rapper\/singer Doechii, signed to CMG via a JV partnership with Top Dawg and TDE at the start of Jubelirer\u2019s reign as Chair\/CEO of CMG.\nDoechii\u2019s What It Is (Block Boy) is closing in on becoming the artist\u2019s first Platinum record in the States; earlier this week, it was named TikTok\u2019s fourth biggest global track of 2023. (A debut Doechii album is anticipated in 2024; other new-act priorities at CMG next year include Young Miko and Rylo Rodriguez.)\nElsewhere, Jubelirer\u2019s team has secured Toosii\u2019s biggest record to date with the 3X platinum Favorite Song, plus one of the US\u2019s biggest-selling hip-hop debuts of the year with Offset\u2019s Set It Off.\nIn addition, long-term CMG signings such as Troye Sivan (recently Grammy nomm\u2019d for his Rush video), Niall Horan, Fletcher, and Maggie Rogers have each celebrated some of the biggest successes of their careers to date.\nDiscussing Capitol\u2019s long-term investment into these acts, Jubelirer notes: \u201cAll are amazing songwriters and performers who are successful globally and have built extremely passionate fan bases. Our focus continues to be on building a rich world for their superfans.\n\u201cTo us, success is not just about momentary chart position; merch, product drops, and experiential moments are key to building and maintaining engagement of superfans. Streaming is crucial, but for many artists, these areas are equally so.\u201d\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s been the return of those little-known mop-tops, The Beatles \u2013 whose CMG-issued \u2018comeback\u2019, Now And Then, released in November, recently hit No.1 in multiple territories including the UK, Germany, and Austria.\nStructurally, Jubelirer has had some fun and games to contend with at CMG in her first two years in charge.\nOne of Jubelirer\u2019s most successful gambits, indie distribution\/services company Caroline (later Virgin Music) was in recent years \u2018spun out\u2019 of CMG \u2013 forming a foundation for the global UMG priority venture that is today known as Virgin Music Group.\nMeanwhile, Motown was also \u2018spun out\u2019 of CMG, to become a standalone frontline label, in early 2021\u2026 before being \u2018spun back\u2019 into CMG at the top of this year.\nPartners of CMG have made their own headlines in the past 12 months, too: Quality Control \u2013 which inked that JV with Motown back in 2015 \u2013 was sold to the Scooter Braun-led HYBE America for $300 million in February; Elliot Grainge\u2019s 10K Projects \u2013 with whom CMG partners for Ice Spice \u2013 was 51%-acquired by Warner Music Group in September.\n(CMG continues to work exclusively with Quality Control on acts such as Quavo, Lil Yachty and Lil Baby, while Ice Spice was \u2018carved out\u2019 of 10K\u2019s Warner deal and remains signed in partnership with CMG on an ongoing basis.)\nHere, MBW gets into it with Jubelirer regarding her first two years in charge at CMG \u2013 and, particularly, how she\u2019s overcome the challenge of quelling, and then re-energizing, one of the most iconic label brands in existence\u2026\nCapitol Music Group is in significantly stronger shape than it\u2019s been for a while. It also feels meaningfully influential in pop culture \u2013 with several tracks in TikTok\u2019s end-of-year \/ most popular playlists. It\u2019s fair to say things looked less steady when you took over as CEO & Chair in 2021. You had to right some turbulence\u2026\nBe careful what you wish for, right [laughs]?\nAs you well know, [before Jubelirer was named CEO\/Chair] CMG had undergone a few leadership changes within a short period of time, and that turmoil was compounded by the economic volatility of the pandemic. As a result, the company faced eroding market share, low morale, and a stagnant artist roster.\nBecause I had spent almost a decade here, I was uniquely situated to bring both a fresh perspective to the job and build a modern culture within the company, while still honoring Capitol\u2019s legacy in profound ways. Meaning, we could be a company that excels at launching and developing Ice Spice, and, at the same time, bring real innovation and full-throttle commitment to the release of a new single from The Beatles. And everything in between!\n\u201cCMG had undergone a few leadership changes within a short period of time, and that turmoil was compounded by the economic volatility of the pandemic. As a result, the company faced eroding market share, low morale, and a stagnant artist roster. Because I had spent almost a decade here, I was uniquely situated to bring both a fresh perspective to the job and build a modern culture within the company.\u201d\nMajor kudos go to [President of Capitol Music Group] Arjun [Pulijal], my partner in all of this, who is a brilliant creative marketer and equally adept at strategizing innovative paths for artists that range from Ice Spice and Offset to Troye Sivan and Paul McCartney. He\u2019s a great motivator and I\u2019m proud of how he\u2019s stepped into this leadership role and excelled over the past two years.\nAnd I\u2019m really glad you mentioned the TikTok-in-2023 wrap-up. Overall, Capitol was the top-performing label across the global and US lists, which tells yet another facet of our success story.\nWhat were your biggest priorities for change on day one as Chair of Capitol Music Group \u2013 and what do they tell us more generally about modernized major label groups in 2023?\nFirst, signing a truly diverse array of new artists, with specific attention on building a strong presence in hip-hop and R&B. Our President of A&R, Jeremy Vuernick, has been crucial to working with me in this regard, as well as overseeing the making of our records. The company hadn\u2019t been consistently competitive in these areas for a very long time, and, remember: Motown had been spun off on its own long before I took the reins of the company. [Motown was spun out in early 2021, then returned to CMG in early 2023].\nSecond, we took a hard look at every aspect of our business. We revamped our entire organizational structure, reset our value system, and even replaced certain terminology that was outdated. All to meet the needs of the modern music business. Arjun was key to this process; his expertise really drove a new dynamic in how marketing, creative, international, digital and commerce now interact.\n\u201cToday, literally every plan is tailored for a specific artist or project \u2014 not pulled from a well-worn playbook \u2014 and our focus is on finding and creating opportunities that will have an impact, no matter where an artist is in their development.\u201d\nToday, literally every plan at CMG is tailored for a specific artist or project \u2014 not pulled from a well-worn playbook \u2014 and our focus is on finding and creating opportunities that will have an impact, no matter where an artist is in their development. The artist\u2019s vision still lies at the heart of every plan, but we really listen to the audience, which is smarter and savvier than ever, to determine if our marketing direction is working and if our artists are properly engaged with their audience.\nWe strive to be ideas-driven and have honest constructive conversations with our artists and each other. We run our business efficiently, and are constantly thinking about where we find real value for our artists.\nWere there any other things at the top of your \u2018to-do\u2019 list?\nPrioritization. I think companies often use that word to mean, \u201cwe\u2019re going to focus on one group of artists and ignore all the others.\u201d For CMG, it means defining what success can uniquely mean for each artist, and then delivering for them.\nWe identify which artists will benefit from, say, the close attention of a small group of people who will bring passion and nuance to marketing and development. Others will clearly need the full power of our organization firing on all cylinders from the get-go.\nWhat\u2019s particularly changed in how you approach artist campaigns both domestically and internationally?\nWe engage directly with international partners earlier than ever before, and don\u2019t unfairly rely on our ex-US affiliates within UMG to do the heavy lifting early on. They have their own local repertoire to work on.\nA good case in point is Doechii\u2019s What It Is, which is platinum in the U.S. and has surpassed 1.1 billion worldwide streams so far. Our team instigated innovative digital strategies through TikTok in Nigeria, then Kenya, which in turn prompted a reaction in the Philippines, then to China with Douyin.\nWithin a few weeks, there were 1.5 million daily \u2018creates\u2019 [using the artist\u2019s music] across those platforms.\n\u201cA big reason for our early emphasis on international is to start the process of building revenue streams as early as possible. I\u2019m talking about brand building and direct-to-fan monetization.\u201d\nA big reason for our early emphasis on international is to start the process of building revenue streams as early as possible. I\u2019m talking about brand building and direct-to-fan monetization.\nIce Spice is a great example of that; she still hasn\u2019t released her debut album, but is recognized around the world through commercials, syncs in video games, TV and film, a big soundtrack presence, and innovative products on her own store.\nHave you seen the Ice Spice American Flag or Chia Pet?\nWhat achievements are you most proud of in the past 12 months?\nWe\u2019ve had an incredible year. Call it our biggest, our best, our strongest\u2014they\u2019re all accurate.\nI\u2019m not one to rattle off a lot of statistics, but I will say that our year-over-year market share is up by 25% and we\u2019ve moved up a notch in the label rankings as well.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had an incredible year. Call it our biggest, our best, our strongest\u2014they\u2019re all accurate.\u201d\nYou referred to CMG not being in strong shape and going through turbulence when I took over, and that\u2019s all true.\nI don\u2019t think any label group has been able to turn things around as quickly as my team and I have done in less than two years.\nOne decision that I\u2019m guessing wasn\u2019t in your control in the past few years was the \u2018spinning out\u2019 of Caroline\/Virgin Music into what is now Virgin Music Group. What have been the pros and cons of that move for you?\nVirgin [first, Caroline] was a major priority for us since the launch of Capitol Music Group in 2012. We really prioritized this area, and oversaw the transition from Caroline into Virgin directly within our company.\nWe were so fortunate to have the talent, and friendship, of [now-Virgin Music Group President] Jacqueline [Saturn] and her team as part of our company for many years.\n\u201cWe were so successful in building [Caroline\/Virgin Music], that it really was only a matter of time before the other labels within UMG would want to grow a similar business within their groups.\u201d\nWe were so successful in building that end of the business, that it really was only a matter of time before the other labels within UMG would want to grow a similar business within their groups. It wouldn\u2019t have made sense to have multiple indie label\/artist services divisions within UMG, so the plan to globalize Virgin and scale it to work with all the labels made so much sense.\nDo I miss having Jacqueline and her team only a few steps away? Of course. But I\u2019m proud of the crucial roles they\u2019ve played in Virgin\u2019s growth and evolution, and we work as closely together as we ever did.\nOn the flip side, Motown has returned as an imprint within CMG after a period as a standalone label. Obviously, that came with an inevitable downsizing process. what shape is Motown in now and what does it add to the CMG makeup?\nMotown is once again fully unified within CMG\u2019s culture after being separate from the company for a couple of years. We have strengthened our longtime partnership with Quality Control, with whom we continue to share tremendous success and plan for a big future.\nWe worked with them on a bold and innovative Lil Yachty alternative album, and we\u2019re all looking forward to new music from Lil Baby next year. Offset not only made a great album \u2013 I expect Grammy nominations for him next year \u2013 he really puts the work in, day-in, day-out.\n\u201cMusic is music, and genres shouldn\u2019t be defined by color. In fact, this business really needs to change its definition of \u201cpop\u201d music. There seems to be real confusion there; we should be calling any music that streams in volume, \u201cpop\u201d music.\u201d\nI knew that if we were going to make significant inroads with hip-hop and R&B company-wide, we needed experts in those areas and fresh perspective on our executive team. [EVP of Capitol Music Group] Orlando Wharton relaunched Priority Records and signed Kodak Black; [Motown SVP of A&R] Kenoe Jordan has been working closely with YoungBoy NBA; and Gordan Dillard brought management and artist development experience from his role at SALXCO.\nWe also promoted Black executives from within, particularly in the areas of A&R and marketing. We\u2019re still searching for the right leader for Motown, and won\u2019t stop until we find one befitting the stature and legacy of such an important label.\nUltimately, we don\u2019t separate music based on genre at CMG, but we do have a number of labels \u2013 Blue Note, Motown, Priority, Astralwerks, Capitol Christian and Tamla \u2013 so artists have real options here.\nMusic is music, and genres shouldn\u2019t be defined by color.

We have experts in every \u201cgenre\u201d but we all share, collaborate and respectfully challenge each other. In fact, I don\u2019t even like the word, \u201cgenre.\u201d Let\u2019s change it!\nBe honest: When you first heard \u201cUnholy\u201d \u2013 from that well-known smooth soul singer Sam Smith \u2013 what was your reaction? Did you know it was a smash hit?\nSam drove this record, from its creation through the decision for it to be the first single. I felt it was a huge leap forward; it was bold and brash \u2013 so distinctive from the first listen \u2013 and I thought it was one of the strongest songs and records Sam had ever created.\nMy role was to marshal everyone in the company to come up with creative and strategic ideas to help lead the global effort behind it, and to make sure our team \u2013 led by Arjun \u2013 worked closely with Jo Charrington and her team at Capitol UK, and with Sam\u2019s managers, Jack Street and Sam Evitt.\nAs Arjun can tell you, digital marketing was key to the effort; the song is in the Top 3 of all-time creations and shares for a pre-release campaign, and the global teams worked together brilliantly to connect that pre-release momentum to the biggest looks at the DSPs, in the media and at radio.\nThe fact that Unholy broke records at the streaming services was extremely gratifying, and the Grammy that they won with Kim Petras was so well-deserved. Not only is Sam a brilliant and unique artist, they were the first new artist to break big at our company after we launched, and we consider them to be family.\nI want Sam to be with us forever and as much a part of our legacy as the great superstars who came before them.\nTalking of firsts: What about your first meeting with Ice Spice? And tell us about that fateful dinner with her and Elliot \u2013 a dinner about which you politely reminded him, in a NOW-INFAMOUS ARTICLE, that you also attended!\nI will forever tease Elliot about his \u201cselective\u201d memory on what transpired that evening! For the record, at that dinner \u2013 which led to the co-signing of Ice Spice by Capitol and 10K \u2013 were me, Elliot, Jeremy Vuernick, [10K co-presidents] Zach Friedman and Tony Talamo. All of us attended and won her heart as a team. Equally, she won my heart.\nBut it\u2019s far more important to focus on the extraordinary artist we were there to see. I\u2019ve been working with artists for decades, and it is a rare occasion when you sit with an artist and just know that you\u2019re in the presence of a future global superstar. That was, and is, Ice Spice.\n\u201cIce Spice is a strong woman, and you\u2019ll notice that she has aligned herself with other strong women.\u201d\nHer early music was exciting and her explosive growth as an artist and cultural figure has already transcended the world of music. In short, she\u2019s becoming a household name. All of this is a testament to her talent and drive, and the effort to help develop and break her has been a real team effort between Capitol, 10K and her manager, James Rosemond Jr.\nI also want to point out that Ice Spice is a strong woman, and you\u2019ll notice that she has aligned herself with other strong women. [Ice Spice also signed to Universal Music Publishing Group via UMPG\u2019s Chairman and CEO, and close Jubelirer colleague, Jody Gerson.]\nAs you noted, Ice Spice is well on her way to becoming a household name, especially in the US; what have been the key ingredients in widening her audience from Munch to now?\nHere\u2019s the thing about Ice Spice \u2013 her look, her flow, her lyrics, and the collaboration choices she\u2019s made: Taylor Swift, Nikki Minaj, PinkPantheress \u2014 are all of paramount importance in her success. She knows precisely who she is and what is right for her to do \u2013 and not do. That\u2019s such a rare quality to possess at such a young age, and it serves her well. A plethora of opportunities are coming toward her at warp speed, and she has the instinct to make the right choices at the right time.\n\u201cA plethora of opportunities are coming toward her at warp speed, and she has the instinct to make the right choices at the right time.\u201d\nOur EVP of Media, Ambrosia Healey, scored a major coup by getting Ice the season opener of Saturday Night Live, which is just one of her many big media appearances. Every department has played an integral role in the launch and development of Ice Spice, but as I said before, it\u2019s only the beginning. Stay tuned.\nIt\u2019s kind of weird how The Beatles Now And Then has somehow slipped into the band\u2019s canon \u2013 while enjoying modern chart success at the same time. How involved were you in that project and what was your experience of it?\nNever in a million years would I have thought I\u2019d be involved in releasing a brand-new single from The Beatles. Arjun and I got a preview of the song from Jeff Jones at Apple Corp earlier this year, and began planning and strategizing on a global level with him, along with UMG UK and [Universal Music Enterprises President and CEO] Bruce Resnikoff and his team.\nThe whole experience has been a \u201cpinch me\u201d moment. The Beatles mean the world to me \u2014 I\u2019m a massive lifelong fan and they are such an important part of our company\u2019s DNA. I was thrilled to sign Paul [McCartney] directly to Capitol in 2016, and he is such an important frontline artist for us. He continues to make amazing music and has achieved some of his biggest solo success in recent years, including back-to-back #1 albums.\n\u201cThe whole experience has been a \u201cpinch me\u201d moment. The Beatles mean the world to me\u2026 I was thrilled to sign Paul [McCartney] directly to Capitol in 2016, and he is such an important frontline artist for us.\u201d\nFor Now And Then our goal was to highlight the storytelling around the creation of the song, while also ensuring that it was treated like a brand-new record (albeit 50 years in the making) that should become an important part of the cultural conversation.\nIt\u2019s surreal when you see a new Beatles song, in 2023, as the cover of New Music Friday on Spotify, trending creations on short-form platforms, being played across all current formats of radio, synced across network TV, and topping single charts. I\u2019m really proud that Capitol was able to help present Now And Then to the world, and that our team \u2014 led by Arjun \u2014 was integral to creating a global campaign worthy of the historic nature of this release. It\u2019s certainly what The Beatles deserved.\nHow great that It\u2019s been such a global success, and that, once again, The Beatles managed to bring even a moment of unity to the world through the beauty and power of their music. Being involved in this has been a real career highlight for me, without a doubt.\nIf I could give you our patented MBW magic wand to change something about today\u2019s business right here and now, what would it be and why?\nWe could be talking for hours about this, Tim, and there are a few things out there I\u2019d like to change with that wand! But I\u2019ll spare you an exhaustive rant and focus on one issue.\nWe need more diversity at all levels and within all facets of the music industry, particularly on the label side.\n\u201calong with doing what I can to increase the number of women at our company.

{"title":"The best video games of the year so far","context":"## The best video games of the year so far\n\nFor the first year in recent memory, scale did not necessitate tradition, and scope did not preclude getting weird. In 2023, nothing was sacred in video games, and so they felt more vibrant than ever.\nSure, some of the more \u201cfocused\u201d games threw us for a pleasant loop: Dredge begins as a lonely fishing sim before transforming into something otherworldly, and Humanity morphed from a pensive art project into an all-out war. Dave the Diver, similarly, is not so much about being a diver as it is about running a sushi restaurant, or hunting for alien artifacts, or conversing with said aliens, or \u2014 you get the point. Whether you booted up your Steam Deck for a cross-country flight or hid your Switch off screen during that boring Zoom meeting, the game you returned to was rarely the one you left behind.\nThis amorphousness (I\u2019m begging our copy editor to let this one slide, because what other \u201cword\u201d could adequately summarize the video games of 2023?) wasn\u2019t consigned to the newcomers, though. Larian Studios, fresh off two years of early-access development and riding the reputation it had garnered from Divinity: Original Sin 2, saw fit to release a role-playing game in which you can kill off nearly every main character the moment you meet them. Remedy Entertainment \u2014 let\u2019s be honest, this group has always been strange \u2014 made a sequel that\u2019s equal parts horrifying, hilarious, fun, and fabulous. And Nintendo? Well, Nintendo had another banner year. That\u2019s no surprise. The real surprise? It finally let go, and let players toy with the digital molecules of its most revered series. More on this below.\nAs the year comes to a close, it\u2019s intoxicating to see developers of all sizes, in every genre, with every tier of budget, mining the depths of interactive design, branching this way and that as they follow their respective veins of gold. They\u2019re nowhere near the bottom of that particular expanse, of course \u2014 and that\u2019s a heartening thought. \u2014Mike Mahardy\nHow the Polygon top 50 list works\nOver the past few weeks, the Polygon staff voted, championed, debated, and ultimately threw up its hands and marveled at the list of mammoths, curiosities, puzzle boxes, and black holes that is our top 50 games of 2023. Any video games that were released in 2023, received substantial updates in 2023, or achieved renewed cultural relevance in 2023 were eligible for this list. Last year, the cutoff for consideration was Nov. 30. (You\u2019ll notice a certain Firaxis Games joint fairly high up our list.) This year, the cutoff was the same. Should we be thoroughly enamored with Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader or Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, we\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re considered for next year\u2019s top 50.\nTop 50\n50. Mr. Sun\u2019s Hatbox\nDeveloper: Kenny Sun\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch and Windows PC\nMr. Sun\u2019s Hatbox is about a hat delivery person (or maybe it\u2019s just a blob with legs?) that takes their job way too seriously. At the beginning of the game, a customer\u2019s package gets stolen and whisked away to a nearby towering castle. Despite the client\u2019s apathy toward a single missing hat, the delivery company, named Amazin, proceeds to set up an entire subterranean paramilitary operation beneath the poor customer\u2019s home.\nAs its premise suggests, this pixelated 2D roguelite leans into the absurd. Part Metal Gear Solid 5, part Spelunky, you undertake missions where you blast away enemies and kidnap them for your own operation, all while slapstick action unfolds. While on a mission, anything from a desk lamp to daggers is fair game for a weapon. In between fights, you expand your base, where you manage a staff of brainwashed blob-people. It\u2019s fast, frenetic fun, and especially enjoyable to share with friends in co-op. \u2014Ana Diaz\n49. Lies of P\nDeveloper: Neowiz Games\nWhere to play: Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\nYes, Lies of P is a Dark Souls mixed with Pinocchio, and that\u2019s a questionable elevator pitch from the outset.\nIn the years leading up to Lies of P, \u201cPinocchiosouls\u201d was more of a running joke than anything \u2014 this profane idea that you can take any world and slap some Dark Souls into it to get people mildly interested. But once you\u2019re in the game, eliminating bosses left and right with your sweet parry moves, you\u2019ll quickly find yourself entirely unbothered by how strange Lies of P initially seemed. And you\u2019ll start telling your partner things like \u201cI have to go back to Geppetto to upgrade my puppet body\u201d like it\u2019s a perfectly normal task to assign yourself on a Tuesday afternoon.\nIt\u2019s very rare for a Soulslike to ever feel like anything more than a knockoff \u2014 even when they\u2019re decent fun, like The Surge. But the best compliment I can give Lies of P is that it feels like the genuine article, a FromSoftware game developed in an alternate dimension and somehow released in this one by mistake. But it wasn\u2019t a mistake or luck that made Lies of P, and it wasn\u2019t FromSoftware, either; it was a talented group of developers at Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio that took a tired genre, paired it with a bizarre IP, and knocked it out of the park. \u2014Ryan Gilliam\nRelated Lies of P carves a singular space out of the Soulsborne genre\n48. Tchia\nDeveloper: Awaceb\nWhere to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC\nTchia is an open-world adventure game set in a fictional version of island nation New Caledonia \u2014 inspired by Awaceb\u2019s co-founder\u2019s childhood in the country.\nEverything is filtered through the titular main character Tchia\u2019s eyes, eyes with a special power that allows her to transform into any animals or objects in her environment. Birds, dolphins, a camera, or rocks\u2026 It\u2019s all an option for Tchia.\nThe game, while clearly inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, ends up standing on its own because of the innovative shapeshifting mechanics. Tchia isn\u2019t as technically polished as a Nintendo title with hundreds of developers; Awaceb has a team of roughly a dozen. Still, it\u2019s hard to innovate in such a ubiquitous genre, yet Awaceb has managed to do just that with Tchia, making it one of the best games so far this year. \u2014Nicole Carpenter\n47. Blasphemous 2\nDeveloper: The Game Kitchen\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\nLong gone are the days when the Metroidvania genre languished untouched for years on end. But despite an influx of entries in recent years, few have exhibited as much mastery as Blasphemous 2. Building off of the strong roots of the first game, Blasphemous 2 continues to use Spanish Catholicism as a narrative and aesthetic touchpoint, telling a twisted religious tale that\u2019s about as far from proselytizing as you can get.\nAfter the success of the first game, the developers have focused on refining the combat, adding multiple weapons and bizarre, hidden customization options that allow you to take command of how your character rips this world to shreds. The last time I played a 2D Metroidvania with this much polish and charm, it was Hollow Knight. Blasphemous 2 might not reach those same heights, but it comes damn close. \u2014Russ Frushtick\n46. Party Animals\nDeveloper: Recreate Games\nWhere to play: Windows PC and Xbox Series X\nI do not know how Recreate Games managed to render some of the cutest animals I\u2019ve ever seen. I also do not know how Recreate made me completely OK with picking up these cute animals and flinging them into black holes, poison clouds, or freezing tundras. The second the match starts in Party Animals, all those cute fluffy corgis, rabbits, kitties, and ducks become my enemies. I will beat them with a bat until they can\u2019t wake up anymore, and I won\u2019t think twice about it. Party Animals may have made me a monster? I don\u2019t know.\nThe Gang Beasts-esque wiggly physics mixed with the cute characters makes for a perfect party game of fluffy fighting. \u2014Julia Lee\nRelated September games you might have missed\n45. The Talos Principle 2\nDeveloper: Croteam\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X\nLike its predecessor, The Talos Principle 2 tackles grand science fiction ideas, particularly about what it means to be human \u2014 a theme thoroughly explored in this installment of the series set in a post-human society of AI-powered robots that are carrying on human culture and civilization. Also like its predecessor, The Talos Principle 2 is replete with philosophical commentary and references to famous artists and thinkers. My favorite is a riff on Werner Herzog\u2019s famous quote about birds: \u201cThe enormity of their flat brain. The enormity of their stupidity is just overwhelming.\u201d\nBut if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re playing the game because you\u2019re an absolute freak for light refraction, gravity, and geospatial puzzles. There are so many puzzles in this game \u2014 there\u2019s even a puzzle metagame, spread across the game\u2019s gorgeous map \u2014 and they\u2019re each excellent, teaching you new concepts before refracting them and forcing you to think differently. \u2014Nicole Clark\nRelated November games you might have missed\n44. Fading Afternoon\nDeveloper: yeo\nWhere to play: Windows PC\nVideo games demand an account for your time. Some video games track the minutes and hours you\u2019ve spent on screen. Others impose strict limits on how long you play, or how much you can do. But all video games constantly ask: How will you spend your time? Seiji Maruyama doesn\u2019t know how much time he has left. Fresh out of prison, he\u2019s not a young man anymore, but he doesn\u2019t want the streets to know. So he returns to his life as a yakuza heavy, hoping to make his mark again.\nFading Afternoon ends when Seiji\u2019s time runs out. Based on the choices you make, the consequences of which are initially obfuscated, this could be five minutes after the game begins, or it could be five hours. He has a bad cough and a pack of cigarettes, each a metaphor for the ticking clock inside of him. You could go to work, brawling on the streets. Or you can simply pass the time: Listen to a jazz band. Play video poker. Buy a home. Fall in love. You have the time, until you don\u2019t. \u2014Joshua Rivera\n43. Suika Game\nDeveloper: Aladdin X\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch\nI thank VTubers every day for many things, but I will kiss the feet of the anime avatars that introduced me to Suika Game. The engrossing 2048-meets-Tetris-with-physics fruit drop game has become my go-to whenever I need to kill some time. Note that I am talking about the official Nintendo Switch version, not all of the horrific ad-plagued knockoffs that have flooded the App Store.\nThe thing that makes Suika so special, in addition to its cutesy gameplay, is its quality as a social game. The same way we sit around and talk about our NYT Connections, we sit around and talk about our fruitless (ha) attempts at getting double watermelons or breaking the 3,000 point threshold. It\u2019s also a great game to watch: Nothing is funnier than seeing somebody\u2019s Suika run go downhill in 30 seconds flat. (There\u2019s a reason why the game has taken the streaming world by storm.) \u2014JL\n42. League of Legends Season 13\nDeveloper: Riot Games\nWhere to play: Mac and Windows PC\nLeague of Legends\u2019 13th season is one of the game\u2019s most balanced yet. Almost every champion has felt viable throughout the year \u2014 no small feat for a game with over 140 playable characters \u2014 and it\u2019s led to great fun and variety on the solo queue ladder and in professional play, where an exciting Worlds just wrapped up.\nBut there\u2019s another reason League had an outstanding 2023: Arena, a new game mode introduced during the game\u2019s summer event. Arena is a 2v2v2v2 battle mode with fast-paced chaos, using League\u2019s roster of champions in a more approachable and containable setting (and with less rage-inducing teammates). The mode was removed after the conclusion of the summer event, but is reportedly returning soon. It can\u2019t possibly come soon enough; I know how I\u2019ll be spending a good chunk of my winter. \u2014Pete Volk\nRelated Arcane is officially League of Legends canon now\n41. Goodbye Volcano High\nDeveloper: KO_OP\nWhere to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC\nGoodbye Volcano High is a visual novel with rhythm game elements, and it takes place at the precipice of the end of the world. It\u2019s centered on a group of teenage dinosaurs entering their senior year of high school, a perfect balance between high school dramatics and the grim future of Earth, as a meteor rockets toward the planet. Though the rhythm game elements can feel a bit finicky \u2014 and don\u2019t seem to matter much, in terms of progressing the game \u2014 Goodbye Volcano High\u2019s music only adds to the dimensional, raw experience created by worker-owned studio KO_OP.\nIt\u2019s rare to find a game that takes the teenage experience seriously, but Goodbye Volcano High does just that. It\u2019s a time in your life where you feel so, so much. You can see that earnestness in the teenage experience where everything is a big, huge issue \u2014 sometimes to the point of cringe \u2014 tied up in that big, global issue of the meteor that\u2019s looking to destroy everything. \u2014N. Carpenter\nRelated August games you might have missed\n40. World of Warcraft Classic\nDeveloper: Blizzard Entertainment\nWhere to play: Mac and Windows PC\nSomething very, very interesting started to happen in the retro version of WoW this year. While Blizzard has been content to march one half of the game\u2019s community forward through its history of expansions, it\u2019s started to come up with creative ways to keep the other half \u2014 the half that wants to stay in the game as it was at launch \u2014 engaged.\nThe first of these was Hardcore, a brilliant permadeath mode that instantly made this aging game both more dangerous and more social, resurrecting the spirit of its 2004 servers. The second, just launched, is the wild Season of Discovery, which remixes and restructures the original WoW experience \u2014 interpolating staggered level caps, shuffling class roles \u2014 in ways that might just change MMO design forever. WoW Classic is quietly, and paradoxically, where Blizzard is doing its most forward-thinking work right now. \u2014Oli Welsh\n39. Fire Emblem Engage\nDeveloper: Intelligent Systems\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch\nFire Emblem Engage was designed for a very specific kind of sicko: one not particularly interested in the origin stories of a horde of teenagers, or the politics of a bourgeoise academy, or what kind of tea a teacher prefers, but instead one obsessed with the endless minutiae of combat stats, weapon loadouts, and team composition. I know this because I am one such sicko.\nIf you\u2019ve read any of my reviews or essays on Polygon, then you know I prefer strategy games that can get out of their own way. More precisely, I love when strategy developers can put their pens down, throw their hands up, and admit that the stories unfolding in the player\u2019s head will almost always be more powerful than anything they could write. Fire Emblem Engage is one of the foremost proponents of this idea. It hurls an excess of characters, weapons, battle scenarios, and stat-boosting abilities at you, leaving the door open for you to observe character interactions on the battlefield and create the resulting fanfiction in your head. Its actual script is a quagmire of nonsensical JRPG tropes, and each cutscene is more skippable than the next. But if you\u2019re looking for an excellent turn-based tactics game that gets out of the player\u2019s way, you can do a whole lot worse than Fire Emblem Engage. \u2014M. Mahardy\n38. Pizza Tower\nDeveloper: Tour De Pizza\nWhere to play: Windows PC\nPizza Tower is a perfect object, and fully committed to its vision. You play as Peppino Spaghetti, a chef who must race up the pizza tower in order to defeat the existential threat posed by Pizzaface, an enormous floating pizza that also happens to be sentient. Super normal stuff. To get there, you platform through a series of levels, picking up speed as you zoom through enemies and obstacles. It\u2019s easy to get into a flow state.\nPizza Tower also beautifully captures the essence of the Wario Land series. The game is delightful to look at, with an irreverent art style that\u2019s referential to late-\u201990s and early-2000s cartoons, and absurd enemies and animations. Levels are also chock-full of secret rooms, passageways, and treasures, making it hard to put down and fun to replay. \u2014N. Clark\nRelated Pizza Tower is platformer paradise for Wario freaks\n37. Subpar Pool\nDeveloper: grapefrukt games\nWhere to play: Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PC\nYou can play this delightful physics puzzler \u2014 best described as dynamic minigolf on a pool table \u2014 on Switch or Steam if you want, but it\u2019s most at home on your phone. It\u2019s an absolutely ideal mobile game: a reasonably priced paid app with no ads, in-app purchases, or subscription, playable in a spare three minutes. Pocket adorable, smiling pool balls on tables adorned with conveyor belts, portals, and moving pockets, while challenging yourself with a host of mix-and-match rulesets (balls that crack, split, or home in on you, a locked starting position, more balls, no guideline for bounces, etc.). Mobile gamers of taste will recognize the work of grapefrukt, aka Martin Jonasson, Swedish developer of such elegant classics as Holedown, Twofold Inc., and Rymdkapsel. \u2014OW\n36. Amnesia: The Bunker\nWhere to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\nIf only one developer could be said to have a master\u2019s grasp on interactive horror, I\u2019d have to tip my hat to Frictional Games. The Amnesia series has always been a thrill ride of terrifying chases and the quiet, a little too quiet, moments that build up tension between. Amnesia: The Bunker is no different. In fact, it\u2019s one of Frictional\u2019s best.\nSet in a seemingly abandoned bunker that\u2019s been sealed by explosions during World War I, your simple yet difficult task is to find an exit. This being a horror game, though, you also have to collect fuel for the bunker\u2019s generator \u2014 a veritable beating heart \u2014 and scrutinize maps on safe room walls, before venturing into the titular structure\u2019s labyrinthine bowels. Oh, also! There\u2019s a monster hunting you. And it can ambush you from wall vents. And it\u2019s attracted to even the slightest bit of sound. And whether you\u2019re juicing your hand-cranked flashlight, triggering long-forgotten tripwires, or just opening a heavy door into yet another concrete-encased corridor, you\u2019re going to have to make noise at some point. The Bunker is as potent in its terror as any horror video game out there. \u2014M. Mahardy\n35. Lil Gator Game\nDeveloper: MegaWobble\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\nIn an unprecedented year for game releases, I understand why you\u2019re surprised to see Lil Gator Game this high up on our list. But imagine how surprised I was to find myself, in a moment of introspection, realizing that it was one of my own favorite games in 2023. At the risk of diminishing its accomplishments, I\u2019m going to make a comparison that should cut to the quick for interested parties: This is the most A Short Hike-alike that I\u2019ve discovered yet, and I\u2019ve been chasing that singular high for years. So if you have a lazy weekend afternoon and want to spend it playing \u2014 not gaming, but playing, in the joyous, unstructured sense of a day in the park \u2014 I can\u2019t recommend this li\u2019l game enough. \u2014Chris Grant\nRelated Lil Gator Game has the heart of Wind Waker and the adventure of Breath of the Wild\n34. Starfield\nDeveloper: Bethesda Game Studios\nWhere to play: Windows PC and Xbox Series X\nStarfield had so much to prove, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of what it accomplished: top-tier world-building, a fantastically customizable ship builder, and Bethesda\u2019s most engaging combat to date. Galaxy-spanning faction quests give you plenty to do, but it\u2019s the side quests that really make you feel like the captain in something Star Trek adjacent: generation ships and superhero hideouts and colonies of clones. There\u2019s good sci-fi here for those willing to make the journey.\nIt\u2019s true that the game oversold the idea of a galaxy with over 1,000 planets, a number that pales in comparison to the game\u2019s most obvious competitor, No Man\u2019s Sky. It\u2019s a shame this became so much of the focus thanks to Bethesda\u2019s marketing, because that same focus obscured the absolutely fascinating new game plus mode at the game\u2019s heart. Consider this: No Man\u2019s Sky is the game that realizes the universe\u2019s infinite number of planets, while Starfield realizes the universe\u2019s infinite number of possibilities. \u2014Clayton Ashley\n33. System Shock\nDeveloper: Nightdive Studios\nWhere to play: Windows PC\nIn a year of several stellar remakes and immersive sims, it wouldn\u2019t have been surprising if System Shock showed its age of nearly 30 years. At least, it would have been understandable if the changes needed to update the game would leave it nigh unrecognizable. That\u2019s why Nightdive Studios\u2019 accomplish is so impressive: It updated the 1994 classic with a slick coat of modern paint while also preserving what made the game so thrilling in the first place.\nThe element where that\u2019s most evident is in the game\u2019s look, which captures all of the original System Shock\u2019s garish cyberpunk neons and frightening enemies in a style that appears like a modern high-fidelity game at a distance, but subtly transforms into retro pixel bitmaps on closer inspection. In much the same way, the gameplay feels surprisingly modern at a distance, but on closer inspection, you start to see how this proto-immersive sim is actually what inspired so much modern game design. You have to rely on your own curiosity, caution, and cunning to navigate the halls of Citadel Station and upgrade your hacker into a cybernetic death machine. It\u2019s a game that expects a lot from the player (and a little save scumming), but the experience is just as rewarding as it was in 1994. \u2014CA\nRelated The System Shock remake does something remarkable\n32. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor\nDeveloper: Respawn Entertainment\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X\nIs Star Wars Jedi: Survivor an Empire Strikes Back level of sequel? Well, no, but it manages to get extraordinarily close to being one of the best follow-ups in the entire Star Wars franchise.\nThe game improves upon Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in every conceivable way, with a more entertaining, action-oriented start and a ton of aerial movements and lightsaber stances that make you feel even more like a seasoned Jedi Knight. Quality-of-life improvements like fast travel make the game less frustrating to play, while the new locales packed with hidden collectibles and upgrades make exploration more rewarding.\nBut what makes Jedi: Survivor truly special isn\u2019t this crude matter, but its luminous heart. You feel it in the memorable characters you meet on your galactic journey, be it the people you help or the friendships you forge and reconcile with. It\u2019s in the classic, crowded cantina where you actually want to go check in with the barkeep. It\u2019s in the tactile, reverent way you craft your lightsaber. And it\u2019s in the kinetic set-pieces that remind you of the serials Star Wars was originally inspired by. At its best, you really can feel the Force around you. \u2014CA\n31. Connections\nDeveloper: The New York Times\nWhere to play: Android, browser, and iOS\nAfter the acquisition of viral hit Wordle, The New York Times\u2019 Crossword ecosystem leveled up to full-fledged attention competitor \u2014 NYT is a media company with a gaming platform. And its staff of puzzle writers and editors are not stooping to mind-numbing mobile content to keep the expansion going. Connections, its latest title to pair well with morning coffee, is one of the year\u2019s best games.\nConnections offers you a grid of 16 words and a mission: Detect the common threads between four different sets of words without embarrassing yourself. The grouping logic ranges from simple (\u201canimals\u201d) to silly (\u201csynonyms for farting\u201d) to sneaky (\u201ccountries when the letter \u2018A\u2019 is added\u201d). Gruff game show watchers who claim the puzzle is just a clone of BBC\u2019s long-running Only Connect miss the personality within; Connections writer Wyna Liu brings a tremendous wit to each day\u2019s puzzle, constructing thematic grids and throwing synonym curveballs. And like with Wordle, there\u2019s a sense of accomplishment when you land all four sets \u2014 there\u2019s no better start to a day than gloating to friends and family about how you completely nailed Connections. \u2014Matt Patches\n30. Hi-Fi Rush\nDeveloper: Tango Gameworks\nWhere to play: Windows PC and Xbox Series X\nIn Hi-Fi Rush, you play as Chai, a guy who must escape the factory of a villainous corporation. In a workplace accident, Chai\u2019s iPod gets punched into his chest, making him sensitive to sound and staying on beat. What follows is a joyful action-rhythm game where you explore, climb, and fight to the beat of the music.\nThe game is a remarkably inviting take on a genre not exactly known for being accessible. But Hi-Fi Rush does away with hardcore precision in exchange for gameplay that always subtly nudges you back toward keeping in time. Failing to attack on a drum stroke doesn\u2019t mean failing a fight; you just don\u2019t get a combo multiplier. And the musical score never gets jarring as a punishment; punchy notes always play in time with the rhythm, even if you hit a button at the wrong time. The result is a game that evokes the thrill of feeling like you\u2019re acing it and getting into a flow, no matter your skill level. \u2014N. Clark\n29. Monster Hunter Now\nDeveloper: Niantic\nWhere to play: Android and iOS\nWhile Niantic\u2019s post-Pok\u00e9mon Go track record hasn\u2019t been the most consistent, Monster Hunter Now shows the company at its best, with a refined combat system, simple matchmaking, great monster variety, and extensive character upgrades. Granted, those upgrades are part of a monetization setup that gets a little heavy-handed, but if you\u2019re patient, there\u2019s plenty of game here for free. And unlike in some of Niantic\u2019s other games, the real-world elements don\u2019t feel tacked on, with a design that blends almost perfectly with the company\u2019s map tech, allowing you to feel like you\u2019re tracking monsters as you get outside and walk around. It all makes for a big step forward in fusing Niantic\u2019s real-world tech approach with combat and exploration mechanics that can stand up on their own. \u2014Matt Leone\nRelated Monster Hunter Now is the most traditional Niantic game yet\n28. Diablo 4\nDeveloper: Blizzard Entertainment\nWhere to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\nWith Diablo 4, Blizzard Entertainment set out to marry the frenetic action of Diablo 3, the deep RPG systems of Diablo 2, and the dark tone of the original game. It was an ambitious promise, to be sure, but four years and a whole pandemic after the studio announced the long-awaited sequel at BlizzCon 2019, it\u2019s here, and it\u2019s fantastic.\nBut Diablo 4\u2019s marriage of tone, action, and role-playing isn\u2019t what makes it so good. In addition to all of those other things, Diablo 4 is the best launch we\u2019ve seen for a new \u201cliving game\u201d in recent memory.\nWith the likes of Destiny, Anthem, and even Diablo 3, it was clear from the start that there were some nuggets of potential. But being a fan meant slogging through mountains of frustration just to taste a morsel of what you\u2019d hope those games would become. Playing these games early on was a kind of gamble.\nDiablo 4, however, is unlike any of those projects, because its systems were deep and nuanced from the start, enough to spend hundreds of hours growing your character. And there is already loads of content to support that kind of time investment. \u2014RG\nRelated Diablo 4 activates and frustrates my lizard brain\n27. Hitman World of Assassination: Freelancer mode\nDeveloper: IO Interactive\nWhere to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\nHitman World of Assassination\u2019s Freelancer mode, which debuted in January and puts a roguelike twist on Agent 47\u2019s globe-trotting murder-for-hire missions, isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. It demands constant improvisation, to a degree that can challenge even veteran Hitman players. Repeated failures can make it feel more frustrating than fun.\nBut as every fan of roguelikes knows, these high-stakes experiences have the capacity to deliver a sense of exhilaration like nothing else. Pulling off multiple daring kills, hiding the evidence (or going out with a bang), and trying to make it out alive with all the gear you brought into the mission \u2014 it\u2019s tense and thrilling, every time.\nEvery move you make could be your last one; all it takes to ruin a flawless run is a single ill-considered plan, just one seemingly minor slip-up. With the abyss of failure forever yawning beneath 47, playing Hitman Freelancer can feel like tiptoeing along the top of a barbed-wire fence. The exultation of safely making it to the final exfiltration point, having defeated a crime syndicate after completing a lengthy series of dangerous missions, is a high I\u2019ll keep chasing again and again. \u2014Samit Sarkar\n26. Venba\nDeveloper: Visai Games\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\nI don\u2019t love to cook. For me, it\u2019s more a necessity than anything else. So it\u2019s not often that a piece of media \u2014 or anything, really \u2014 leaves me with the feeling that I need to make something, to spend time in the kitchen reveling in the tedium of chopping and the sizzle of onions frying.\nVenba elicited that urge, reminding me that food is not just something to keep me alive, but something to be cherished. Venba is a cooking game that focuses on an immigrant family that\u2019s moved from India to Canada. Food transcends the story by way of simple cooking minigames as I move through the chapters of main character Venba\u2019s life \u2014 moments that switch between painful and heartwarming. Venba packs as much heart in its one-hour playtime as games 30 times its size. \u2014N. Carpenter\nRelated Venba expands the boundaries of the cooking genre\nTop 25\n25. Viewfinder\nDeveloper: Sad Owl Studios\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5 and Windows PC\nAt the heart of Viewfinder is a magic trick that never gets old: You take a photo of the environment and paste that perspective into the game world to create a bridge or reveal a needed trinket. The experience of seeing reality distorted by your hands so easily is nearly on the level of thinking with Portals for the first time. You\u2019ll ponder a solution for minutes, sure it\u2019s impossible and that the developers must have made a mistake, before you\u2019re struck by a eureka moment like a lightning bolt.\nThe game\u2019s lesson on perspective extends to its narrative, which, much like the photos you use to manipulate the world, contains multitudes. Though it\u2019s told in fairly typical video game-y audio monologues that you uncover from the game\u2019s trippy environments, the journey is powerful and topical. Just as differing perspectives can allow for unique solutions, they can also obscure truths that lead us to deny the reality that\u2019s right in front of us. \u2014CA\nRelated Viewfinder is puzzle game heaven\n24. Humanity\nDeveloper: tha\nWhere to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC\nHumanity looks like a modern art project, recalls memories of early PlayStation oddity, and comes (in part) from the team behind game of the future Rez Infinite. But its most impressive feat is the way it gradually shifts genres, starting as a classic puzzle game, then taking on tower defense and shoot-\u2019em-up traits as it evolves into an all-out war. Think Braveheart, with a shiba inu general leading a troop of faceless, brainless low-polygon figures against a group of angry, lightsaber-wielding, even lower-polygon foes. It\u2019s the kind of design subtlety that stays in its lane yet builds on you, and before you realize it, ends very differently than it began. Much like humanity itself? \u2014ML\n23. Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo\nDeveloper: Square Enix\nWhere to play: Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PC\nSquare Enix has plenty of mega-franchises to fill its time (and its coffers). This year, we have new entries for Octopath Traveler and Final Fantasy, along with new Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts games in the not-so-distant future. Dayenu!\nAnd yet, the publisher can\u2019t help itself from bombarding us with surprising, interesting, sometimes great, often good-enough experiments. In 2022, we got an English-language remake of lost gem Live A Live, the surprisingly enjoyable tactical RPG DioField Chronicle, a bonkers Final Fantasy spinoff featuring the musical stylings of Limp Bizkit, and a pair of oddball card games lathered in lore from gaming\u2019s best weirdo. This year, we have the Avengers of rhythm games, Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, and Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, an excellent riff on the visual novel penned by a beloved storyteller \u2014 whose best series has never appeared in the U.S.\nWhat should you know about Paranormasight before you play? Well, ideally nothing. Why else would I be eating up my word count?\nBut if you insist: It\u2019s a mystery \u2014 and a horror mystery at that. You travel to 1980s Japan, specifically the Tokyo neighborhood of Honjo, located not so far from the modern Tokyo Skytree. It\u2019s hard to imagine that modern landmark ever towering alongside these streets, which are filled with shadows and lethal curses.\nIf you have even a passing interest in urban legends, spooky folklore, cults, and deadly rituals, or you\u2019ve enjoyed series like Zero Escape and Danganronpa, Paranormasight is an easy recommendation. And if you just enjoy a good yarn and have access to basically any screen and $15, then you\u2019re a perfect mark too. It runs as well on console and PC as it does on iOS and Android, so don\u2019t fret about where you play, just do so and soon! Before Square Enix stops investing in all these oddities. \u2014Chris Plante\n22. Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns\nDeveloper: Firaxis Games\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\n[Ed. note: Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns was released in 2022, but it just barely missed the cutoff for our best video games of 2022 list, so it\u2019s eligible for our 2023 awards.]\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: Another licensed Marvel game? Come on, right? But hear me out. I played Marvel\u2019s Avengers, too, and this isn\u2019t that. It might seem like it\u2019s going to be at first, because Midnight Suns makes the grave error of introducing Iron Man and Doctor Strange as its tutorial characters, and these two might just be the most irritating characters in the entire video game. (I have beaten the game, so I am allowed to make this call.) You must press on and give Midnight Suns time to win you over. Because it has so, so much more to offer than it may appear in its first few hours.\nPicture the romance and humor of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, combined with the high-stakes tactical battles of XCOM 2 \u2014 that\u2019s what Midnight Suns becomes in its mid-game and endgame. It\u2019s a card-based strategy game, and each hero has their own customizable deck. I started off favoring Captain Marvel, Magik, and Blade, simply because their moves and hilarious dialogue kept me entertained, but I soon realized that every single character has something exciting or unexpected to bring to the battlefront. Over 100 hours later, I\u2019ve leveled up every single character and played all the main story missions and an unknowable number of optional missions, and I\u2019m still not sick of this combat\u2026 or the kooky cast of characters that grows all the time (shoutout to the Deadpool DLC).\nNo matter how sick of Marvel you might be, give Midnight Suns the chance to win you over with its clever combat. And once you\u2019ve gotten hooked, you might find yourself sticking around to chuckle at Wolverine attending Blade\u2019s book club (yes, that\u2019s a storyline in this game). It\u2019s worth your time, and you can take that from me, a person who \u2014 again \u2014 spent over 100 hours on it. \u2014Maddy Myers\n21. Honkai: Star Rail\nDeveloper: Hoyoverse\nWhere to play: Android, iOS, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC\nI have been a... pretty die-hard Genshin Impact player since launch. I\u2019ve rolled for every character, grinded out all of said characters, 100%-ed the exploration, completed every quest \u2014 did all the stuff that would burn anyone out. Honkai: Star Rail is Hoyoverse\u2019s answer to the Genshin Impact burnout.\nThe slower-paced turn-based combat, the ability to auto-battle (if your teams are strong enough), and the smaller maps make it the perfect daily game for me to funnel my interest into without feeling exhausted. The characters are fun, flashy, and easy to latch onto. Should I main the sneaky but elegant Kafka, who uses damage-over-time skills to whittle her opponents away? Or should I use the brooding Blade, who unleashes huge attacks at the cost of his HP? Ah, I guess I\u2019ll let my wallet decide \u2014 it is a gacha game, after all. \u2014JL\n20. Chants of Sennaar\nDeveloper: Rundisc\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One\nIn Chants of Sennaar you climb up a kind of Tower of Babel, and your job is to decipher the distinct language each group of people speaks, eventually aiming to translate fluidly from one language to another. You do so by matching pictographic symbols \u2014 the characters for each language \u2014 to images of the nouns, actions, and concepts in a large dictionary-style book.\nIt sounds complicated, but it\u2019s wonderfully fun because the mechanics are so simple. You explore the isometric world \u2014 which is rendered in a gorgeous cel-shaded style \u2014 witnessing interactions between cultures and attempting to puzzle out the meaning of their written words. The game parcels out words for you to assign meaning to in little packets, to avoid overwhelming you. By the end, you\u2019ll have translated numerous languages, and scaled your way to the top of the tower. Perhaps you\u2019ll even change the tower itself. \u2014N. Clark\n19. Metroid Prime Remastered\nDeveloper: Retro Studios\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch\nFew games from 2002 hold up as well as Metroid Prime, and the remastered version of the game \u2014 which was surprise-dropped during February\u2019s Nintendo Direct \u2014 proves that Samus Aran\u2019s first-person adventure is still worth experiencing, whether it\u2019s for the first time or (in my case) the fourth.\nRetro Studios\u2019 take on one of sci-fi\u2019s most famous intergalactic bounty hunters controversially took her out of the 2D puzzle-platformer realm that made her famous (although Metroid Fusion also came out in 2002 \u2014 a gift for the 2D Metroid purists \u2014 which may also be why Fusion joined Nintendo Switch Online\u2019s catalog shortly after Prime Remastered was released). By placing the player inside Samus\u2019 helmet, Metroid Prime recontextualized the bounty hunter\u2019s relationship with the hostile planets around her.\nAs we donned Samus\u2019 suit and explored strange planets, aggressive alien lifeforms could now get right in our faces, forcing us to dodge, strafe, and roll (in morph ball form, naturally) using all three dimensions. No longer would we sit back and watch as Samus dipped her toe into a pool of lava; in first-person, as molten fire spread over our visor, we\u2019d really feel the pressure to find that Varia Suit upgrade. And perhaps most importantly, from behind Samus\u2019 visor, we gained the ability to scan our enemies and environment, collecting and translating logs from the long-dead Chozo aliens who once inhabited these now-hostile places.\nThe world of Prime is harsh and unrelenting. (Save points will, at times, be quite far from one another.) But it\u2019s worth buckling down and pushing through the pain points to discover this world\u2019s secrets. \u2014M. Myers\n18. Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew\nDeveloper: Mimimi Games\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X\nShadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew may very well be the most bittersweet entry on this list. It is, for my money, one of the best games to be released in 2023. It is also the swan song of Mimimi Games, one of the most underappreciated studios making games throughout the last decade. Mimimi announced its planned closure only two weeks after releasing its final game. This makes The Cursed Crew its swan song. It is also the team\u2019s magnum opus.\nSet in a tropical world of zombie pirates, religious fanatics, and talking ships, The Cursed Crew sees you traveling freely across an archipelago as you revive your undead crew, deploy them on dioramic worlds constituting some of the finest level design in video games to date, and dispatching enemies with a mixture of tactical stealth and supernatural abilities. Taken at a distance, this mixture is undeniably niche. But seen up close, The Cursed Crew is as potent a creation as we\u2019ve seen since 2016\u2019s Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun or 2020\u2019s Desperados 3, which respectively established and cemented the studio\u2019s brilliant design chops. I\u2019ll miss Mimimi \u2014 but I can\u2019t imagine a better farewell. \u2014M. Mahardy\n17. Dredge\nDeveloper: Black Salt Games\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\nDredge is a Lovecraftian horror experience masquerading as a simple fishing game.\nThe open ocean is filled with terrible creatures that can and will damage or destroy your boat. And each of the major islands you visit comes with its own evil sea beasts that must be dealt with if you want to progress the story or fish peacefully. Dredge ultimately tells a dark parable about loss, and how obsession can own you if you aren\u2019t careful.\nBut what makes Dread so special \u2014 and one of the best games of 2023 \u2014 is that under its foreboding story and twisted environments is a fishing game that grows more complex with every outing, centered around an upgrade system that feels amazing to progress through. As the dangers around you grow, so too does your ship\u2019s capabilities. And by adventuring into battles \u2014 metaphorical and otherwise \u2014 with the seas\u2019 most dastardly critters, you\u2019ll always come out on the other side with some upgrades that allow you to catch even better fish and build an even bigger boat.\nBy the time you\u2019ve spent 10 or so hours with Dredge, you\u2019ll feel like a commercial fisherman who just happened upon something bigger and more foreboding than they could have imagined \u2014 and that, perhaps, you\u2019ve stared deep into some kind of black abyss, only to escape forever changed. \u2014RG\nRelated Dredge invents and perfects the fishing horror genre\n16. Final Fantasy 16\nDeveloper: Square Enix\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5\nFinal Fantasy 16 kicks ass. The newest mainline entry in the long, winding series takes you on a lavish, unadulterated Game of Thrones-esque adventure. You play as a broody Clive Rosfield, a young man whose life\u2019s work is to protect his little brother, Joshua. The story begins when Clive\u2019s life takes a turn for the worse and he vows to destroy the monster who ruined his and his family\u2019s legacy.\nDeveloped by Creative Business Unit III, Square Enix\u2019s internal team behind the MMORPG Final Fantasy 14, 16 leans into patchwork territories of fantasy genre fare. There is palace intrigue, a whole lot of sex, and endless war between nations. But the developers then sprinkle in Final Fantasy elements like mother crystals, dazzling kaiju fights between summons (known as Eikons in this iteration), and of course, Chocobos.\nThe quality of the story in this long and linear character-driven RPG waxes and wanes, but the action combat is among the best I\u2019ve ever played. The gameplay grips you from the very beginning as Clive smoothly dashes, parries, and swings his giant sword and varied magic with a dazzling amount of style. The gameplay didn\u2019t just help me stick with the game, but instead allowed my excitement to bubble over every time I took on a new mission. \u2014Ana Diaz\n15. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\nDeveloper: CD Projekt Red\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X\nLike the best DLC, Phantom Liberty does as much to expand on the base game as it does to reframe it. Alongside the sweeping Patch 2.0, which revamped Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s role-playing progression systems, improved its enemy AI, and course-corrected a litany of other details, Phantom Liberty also adds a whole new district to the dystopian world of Night City, complete with its own spy-thriller storyline.\nThe resulting Cyberpunk 2077 is not an entirely different beast than the one that was released in 2020, but it is a more evolved one. It delivers on the promise of building a hacker-samurai in a neon-infused open world replete with futuristic heists, daunting choices, and striking characters. Phantom Liberty and Patch 2.0 may not completely erase the memory of CD Projekt\u2019s initial botched release, but they come pretty damn close. Three years after we first set foot in V\u2019s shoes, Cyberpunk 2077 has finally justified the hype. \u2014M. Mahardy\n14. Dead Space\nDeveloper: Motive Studio\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X\nWith The Last of Us on HBO and Resident Evil 4 back in the conversation, it\u2019s already a banner year for survival horror. Motive Studio\u2019s Dead Space remake is no exception. Following in the footsteps of Capcom\u2019s aforementioned title, the original Dead Space brought the third-person-action focus of Resident Evil 4\u2019s formula to a deteriorating ship in outer space. In the vein of Event Horizon, Sunshine, and Alien, Dead Space was a paragon for sci-fi horror in a confined and claustrophobic setting. Its remake has brought that same vision to gorgeous new life, bringing quality-of-life changes and underappreciated updates (it has made several previously useless weapons into viable tools in protagonist Isaac Clarke\u2019s arsenal), making it hard to imagine ever going back to Visceral Games\u2019 phenomenal original. \u2014M. Mahardy\nRelated The Dead Space remake changes all the right things\n13. Octopath Traveler 2\nDevelopers: Square Enix, Acquire\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC\nThe first Octopath Traveler was one of those games that was as enjoyable to play as it was painful: enjoyable because so much of it kicked ass, but painful because so much of it dragged the positive aspects down. In other words, it stood on the precipice of excellence, but couldn\u2019t quite cross the line.\nOctopath Traveler 2 leaps across that boundary. In place of the original game\u2019s repetitive level design, monotonous narrative structure, and sometimes awkward characterization, the sequel demonstrates an expert ability to challenge your expectations at every turn. Yes, your general goal is still to recruit eight playable characters (hence the name) and follow each of their separate plot threads to their respective conclusions, participating in turn-based battles and side quests along the way. But said plots vary greatly from character to character, and if you so choose, you can see a handful of characters through several major plot points before recruiting the whole gang. Octopath Traveler 2 finely toes the line between that comfort food-esque repetition of the best JRPGs, and the subversive nature of great genre storytelling. \u2014M. Mahardy\n12. Dave the Diver\nDeveloper: Mintrocket\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch and Windows PC\nYou could describe Dave the Diver as a fishing game and a restaurant management simulator, and that\u2019d be correct. But that would also be underselling the game, and understating things quite a lot.\nDiving into the mysterious Blue Hole, Dave spends the first two quarters of his day swimming deeper into the colorful abyss, discovering both sea life and a story that\u2019s equally absurd and earnest. When you\u2019re not picking up sea urchins or spearfishing sharks, Dave is assisting the rest of Dave the Diver\u2019s cast of characters \u2014 his sushi business partners, a community of seafolk, an anime-obsessed weapons expert, and a pair of dolphins. At night, Dave slings sushi and pours drinks at the restaurant, frantically running back and forth between clearing dishes, delivering sushi, and refilling the freshly ground wasabi. Between all that, Dave\u2019s harvesting rice and vegetables on a farm, curating a hatchery, racing seahorses with mermaids, and taking down a suspicious group masquerading as environmental activists. Somehow, there\u2019s even a well-done rhythm video game \u2014 starring one of those anime idols that the arms dealer loves \u2014 that makes perfect sense.\nIt really shouldn\u2019t work; I can\u2019t imagine another game where all these disparate ideas coalesce so seamlessly. But Dave the Diver would feel less complete without any one of them. It makes for such a compelling loop, and a consistent advancement of the game\u2019s story, that I kept finding myself in that \u201cone more day\u201d mindset, eager to jump back into the ocean for one more go. \u2014N. Carpenter\nRelated Management sim Dave the Diver is a delicate balancing act of absurdity and silliness\n11. Resident Evil 4 Remake\nDeveloper: Capcom\nWhere to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X\nIt turns out, Capcom is good at remaking games.\nThe original Resident Evil remake all but set the bar for the format in 2002, with sleeker controls, more nuanced graphical details, and whole new areas to explore in the iconic Spencer Mansion. The Resident Evil 2 remake changed the entire perspective of its source material without sacrificing the focus on horror and survival. Resident Evil 3\u2019s remake, as forgettable as it was, still brought the design conceits of the original game, warts and all, to a modern audience. And now we have Resident Evil 4 \u2014 and what a remake it is.\nIn this reimagined version of the 2005 action-survival-horror game, Capcom has managed to erase many of the blemishes on one of the most beloved games in the series, if not all time. The remake is full of new flourishes and extra details in each of its three sprawling areas, making it less of a remake and more of a dramatic reinterpretation. It has also managed to add even more survival elements to the original\u2019s action-centric combat, without sacrificing the camp and cheese that have made it such an enduring presence throughout the years. A lesser game would have shrunk in the face of such intimidating source material, but the Resident Evil 4 remake achieved the balancing act in spades. \u2014M. Mahardy\nRelated The Resident Evil 4 remake pulls off the same great trick\nTop 10\n10. Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon\nDeveloper: FromSoftware\nWhere to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\nNothing else feels like Armored Core.\nThe giant robot you pilot heaves with the weight of a six-story building but flies into the sky as nimble as a hummingbird. You can skate along the ground, rocket into the air, and change directions in the blink of an eye. You are agile, resilient, deadly.\nWith your hands tightly gripping the controller, you can unload four different weapons at once, weapons you\u2019ve picked out of an armory that could rival a small nation. You target, aim, and fire while moving faster than a fighter jet, dodging streams of missiles, arcs of gunfire, bazookas, and flames.\nThere have been many, many games in the franchise, but none have reached the heights of Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon. The levels have never had such ruined beauty, the enemies have never been as satisfying to fight, and the characters have never been more endearing. An ingenious new game plus mode packs the game\u2019s story with surprises while you continue to build out your arsenal.\nPerhaps the decades-long wait for a new Armored Core game is part of the reason, because the lessons FromSoftware learned creating and popularizing Dark Souls are evident here. Bosses now put you through dastardly skill checks in classic Soulsian fashion. Many of them tower over the landscape, making you, the pilot of a giant robot, feel small. These set-piece fights are some of the most thrilling moments you could play in a game this year. They certainly have some of the most memorable lines.\nBut Armored Core 6 doesn\u2019t just get badass one-liners stuck in your head; its gameplay lingers, too. When you watch videos of it in motion, it simply makes you want to play it, to feel that movement, that motion, for yourself.\nThis isn\u2019t just because the series\u2019 energetic action is unique, but because you decide exactly how your robot feels: how quickly its missiles get a lock, how fast its generator recharges, how far you boost when you swing your laser sword. Swapping components around as you scrutinize competing weight and power requirements is an engaging puzzle all its own. You become intimately familiar with a screen-filling spreadsheet of stats because all of those numbers add up to something that feels real. Tactile. Earned.\nBecause nothing else feels like Armored Core. \u2014CA\nRelated Armored Core 6 brings mecha to the masses\n9. Jusant\nDeveloper: Don\u2019t Nod\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X\nBoulderers, or rock climbers who don\u2019t use safety gear but also don\u2019t ascend very high, have a word for the routes they climb: problems. The idea is that, since you\u2019re never that far from flat ground, completing your route is more a game of mind over matter. You don\u2019t \u201cfinish\u201d a problem. You \u201csolve\u201d it. Like a puzzle.\nWhen it comes to rock climbing, Jusant just gets it in a way few other games \u2014 if any \u2014 have.\nTo be clear, Don\u2019t Nod\u2019s Jusant isn\u2019t technically about bouldering. (A climbing game where you\u2019re never more than 12 feet off the ground would have precisely zero stakes.) But it\u2019s an apt conduit for the spirit of bouldering, in that every route you traverse is a problem to solve. By alternating triggers to dictate which hand goes on which handhold, you navigate these problems. Environmental hazards and a pesky stamina wheel make things progressively trickier. You\u2019re always clear on your heading. (It\u2019s up.) Figuring out how to get there is another matter.\nEven in games that prominently feature it, climbing is often functional, at best \u2014 whether it\u2019s Link refusing to acknowledge handholds are a thing or Nathan Drake snapping to ledges with a level of magnetism only thought possible at CERN.\nJusant is the first and only game I\u2019ve played that gets it \u2014 that sees the inherent grace in the sport and portrays it on the screen, not as a means of getting somewhere, but as the reason to go there in the first place. \u2014Ari Notis\n8. Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2\nDeveloper: Insomniac Games\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 builds on the successes of the first game, both narratively and in its immensely satisfying gameplay. The game\u2019s story takes a familiar Spider-Man narrative \u2014 that of friends turned foes \u2014 and adds new twists, building out compelling villains (and demanding ones) in the process. The game also sheds its predecessor\u2019s odious Spider-Cop bits in favor of establishing a deeper connection between the Spider-Mans and their city, giving the game room to breathe while further immersing you in its heroes\u2019 worlds and struggles.\nAnd then there\u2019s the gameplay. For my money, there are few experiences more enjoyable in gaming than swinging around New York City with Spider-Man. It was fun in the early 2000s, and it\u2019s still fun now. And with a bigger map to explore (and wings to fly, if you so choose to use them), there\u2019s basically no limit to the fun you can get up to. The deployment of two protagonists is seamless \u2014 Peter and Miles play differently, bringing their own stories and desires to the table \u2014 and switching between them is effortless. It\u2019s also the rare open-world game that doesn\u2019t feel bloated with missions and side quests, instead leaving you wanting more Spider adventures. \u2014PV\n7. Street Fighter 6\nDeveloper: Capcom\nWhere to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X\nAfter getting knocked down \u2014 by a self-inflicted punch, no less \u2014 with the feeble Street Fighter 5, Capcom has hit the gym and returned stronger than before with Street Fighter 6. We rightfully called its latest Street Fighter the \u201cultimate fighting game toolbox\u201d in Polygon\u2019s review; from a robust single-player mode to solid online modes to a cast of memorable new and returning World Warriors, Street Fighter 6 is Capcom at its most confident.\nFor newcomers and the lapsed Street Fighter fan wary of jumping into online play, Capcom delivered World Tour mode, a robust, single-player, RPG-lite beat-\u2019em-up in the vein of Sega\u2019s Yakuza games. In World Tour, players hit the streets of Metro City where, hilariously, everyone in town not only knows how to fight, but relishes impromptu fisticuffs with strangers. It\u2019s a matter of local pride.\nThe streets of Metro City are part training grounds, part beginning of a silly, epic worldwide adventure where you learn the basics of Street Fighter 6. Untethered from any serious game narrative canon, Street Fighter 6 lets players of all skill levels and stripes have fun in World Tour mode.\nStreet Fighter 6\u2019s approachability extends to its innovative new control scheme, an addition called Modern Controls. While the six-button layout from the very first Street Fighter is still available, after multiple attempts at giving players a simplified control scheme, Capcom\u2019s finally cracked it. Modern Controls are not only comparatively easy to grasp \u2014 they\u2019re pretty viable competitively.\nBut it\u2019s the finely honed one-on-one fighting mechanics, governed by a streamlined set of meters and flashy new moves, that give Street Fighter 6 its longevity. Thanks to a well-populated social space called the Battle Hub, and a rock-solid online infrastructure, there\u2019s a robust community of other Street Fighter fans to battle against on a daily basis. Add a compelling new roster of characters led by classics like Ryu, Zangief, and Chun-Li, and dazzling newcomers Marisa, Manon, and Kimberly, and it\u2019s clear why Street Fighter 6 is one of the best games of 2023, regardless of genre. \u2014Michael McWhertor\nRelated Street Fighter 6 is the ultimate fighting game toolbox\n6. Cocoon\nDeveloper: Geometric Interactive\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\nI think I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around Cocoon. On the surface, the game appears to have a relatively simple premise: You play as a buglike creature that picks up and places glowing orbs to solve puzzles. However, this is where Cocoon hides its brilliant twist. Each orb functions like a world unto itself, which you can explore, or from which you can extract a new power for your bug. As you collect orbs, you thread together puzzles that will have you weaving in and out of realms in a truly mind-bending experience.\nCreated by Geometric Interactive, a studio founded by developers who previously worked on Limbo and Inside, Cocoon\u2019s brain teasers unfold in a dark sci-fi world. The game goes light on a story that combines biological and mechanical philosophies alike. As you make your way through, you\u2019ll hear the hum of engines and the moist squishy sounds of unknown creatures\u2019 moving flesh.\nCocoon has one-off puzzles that are downright brilliant, but what makes it truly great is the sum of its parts. The pacing of each section feeds smoothly from one challenge to the next. Like the best puzzle games, Cocoon presents instances where an earlier brain teaser might serve as an unsaid tutorial that teaches you a step for a later, more complicated puzzle. Cocoon presents challenges, but it\u2019s also just a joy to play. It is one of the most memorable puzzle games I\u2019ve ever played. \u2014AD\nRelated Cocoon is impossibly good\n5. Pikmin 4\nDevelopers: Nintendo EPD, Eighting\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch\nPikmin 4 is like the perfect amalgamation of Pikmin games. There are fun mini-dungeon caverns, but they\u2019re not filled with terrible bomb traps. There\u2019s new types of Pikmin, but not at the cost of getting rid of the old ones. And there\u2019s a dog now, and he helps corral the Pikmin and make operations run even more efficiently.\nThe entirety of the game is a whimsical joy to play. Even as I completed every Dandori Challenge (which actually got pretty damn hard!) and collected every item, it never became a drag or a grind. It actually might be impossible to be angry while playing this game. Hearing the little Pikmin hum as they carry a huge peach (that they call a \u201cmock bottom\u201d) across the map is enough to melt anyone\u2019s heart. In fact, I was pretty sad when the game ended. I could command these little guys and my puppy friend to collect things forever.\nAll told, the game is beautiful, and, thanks to its quasi real-world setting, it makes me see my own world differently \u2014 there\u2019s something special to be found everywhere, even in the tiniest corners. Maybe all my little trinkets go missing because a little guy needs it to return home. He can have it.\nEven if you\u2019ve never played a Pikmin game before, this game is good, and it\u2019s the perfect place to start. (And then you can play all the rest of them, which have been conveniently ported to the Switch!) \u2014JL\nRelated Pikmin 4 will turn you into an obsessive collector\n4. Super Mario Bros. Wonder\nDeveloper: Nintendo EPD\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch\nWhen you activate Super Mario. Bros. Wonder\u2019s delightful whimsy \u2014 via the aptly named Wonder Flower \u2014 the game becomes more than a 2D platformer. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a musical, a quiz show, a race, or a hidden object game. Pipes become inchworms, Piranha Plants burst into song, and Yoshi becomes a goddamn dragon. Wonder is the first side-scrolling 2D platformer in the Super Mario Bros. line since New Super Mario Bros. U in 2012, and it\u2019s both a faithful rendition of the classic format and a complete reinvention of the series\u2019 irresistible formula.\nEach and every level in Super Mario Bros. Wonder finds some new way to delight and surprise. It\u2019s constantly introducing new ideas, enemies, and wrinkles, only to pull back on them just when it\u2019s on the verge of becoming rote. Like everything else in the Flower Kingdom, a few enemies shift and change in bizarre ways when the Wonder Flower is activated, like Hoppo, the bouncy, round hippo equivalent that grows in size to create chaos in one of Super Mario Bros. Wonder\u2019s many mesmerizing levels.\nAll of this weirdness, combined with Nintendo\u2019s platforming expertise, makes Super Mario Bros. Wonder an entrancing romp alone, with friends, or with strangers online. This is the freshest Mario has felt in decades, and it bodes well for the iconic plumber\u2019s 2D future. \u2014N. Carpenter\n3. Alan Wake 2\nDeveloper: Remedy Entertainment\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X\nThere\u2019s a body in the forest with a hole in its chest. The forest, like the body, is also missing its heart, and a woman must find both. In each, there are pages. This is a story, broken into pieces, we learn. One that ended badly before. One that will likely end badly again. Will you still put it together?\nAlan Wake 2 is full of words but few are in order. It is set in places of confused geography, full of people who don\u2019t quite belong, in rooms that might be different each time you enter them. Alan Wake 2 is wrong, and you must make it right, if you can.\nRemedy Entertainment\u2019s assured masterpiece is less about stories and more about dreams \u2014 the way they can slip from frightening to absurd at a moment\u2019s notice, about how we can get lost in them, learning from our experiences or succumbing to insecurities. How video games can mimic their shape, or lack thereof.\nIt is about repetition, and the way we find meaning in stories and people and places by returning to them over and over, wondering if we changed or they did.\nIn Alan Wake 2, everyone\u2019s story is happening at once, branching out in endless directions, and we might not know the genre until it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s a hypertext mystery, an ergodic game that molds itself to an audience raised online, though few computers are in sight. It\u2019s a game for a world suspended in an endless second act \u2014 forever wars, live services, franchises, infinite scrolls \u2014 endlessly searching for a conclusion. \u2014JR\n2. Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\nDeveloper: Larian Studios\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5 and Windows PC\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 hit at the perfect moment. Despite the handful of truly great computer role-playing games that have been released since the early 2000s (Larian Studios itself made waves with its Divinity: Original Sin series in 2014 and 2017), the genre has largely remained a modern niche. But times have changed: Dungeons & Dragons has undergone something of a renaissance, thanks to actual-play series like Critical Role and Dimension 20. What\u2019s more, Larian had two years of player feedback with which to build its new masterpiece. That masterpiece launched in August, and it garnered the kind of attention that catapults a game from niche interests to widespread acclaim.\nOld CRPG fans finally came home, the Mass Effect generation has discovered a new kind of RPG to sink its teeth into, and D&D fans have found an exceptional digital version of their beloved tabletop game to play alone or with their party in co-op.\nLike a good DM, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 teases out story beats that feel personal to you, cleverly luring you into experiences that seem like they wouldn\u2019t make sense in anyone else\u2019s campaign. Every act delivers quiet, memorable character moments and anxiety-inducing battles. All of these situations feel organic, allowing Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 to replicate, perhaps as closely as a video game can, Dungeons & Dragons\u2019 best feature: the intoxicating sense that anything could happen at any moment.\nThe best games this year told their stories in interesting ways, be it ignoring your superpowers to bike through your old neighborhood in Queens, a musical number, or fractured memories hidden in a puddle. But Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 takes experimental storytelling to another level. Every choice and every new direction is a simple success, fail, or crit away. One roll of the dice after another can take you all the way from a crashed Nautiloid to the city of Baldur\u2019s Gate itself.\nIn a year filled with beautiful stories and powerful moments, it\u2019s the spinning whir of Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\u2019s d20 that defined video game storytelling in 2023. \u2014RG\n1. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\nDeveloper: Nintendo EPD\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch\nPrincess Zelda is missing. Ganondorf has returned, somehow, and he\u2019s really hot. So an age-old hero in a green tunic has to step in. We all know the beats \u2014 how could you possibly make that into anything new?\nTears of the Kingdom definitely didn\u2019t seem like it was poised to make that happen: a sequel to one of the most popular Zelda games ever made, originally conceived as DLC, and built on the same map. Yet, it is something else entirely. It\u2019s not just that Breath of the Wild was a rough draft for Tears of the Kingdom \u2014 it\u2019s that the entire Zelda series was a collection of stepping stones that led in winding, influential pathways to this wacky, wonderful, and thoroughly new world of Hyrule.\nI mean, Ultrahand alone. Just absolutely slathering pieces of wood in what amounts to magical Gorilla Glue and watching in wonder as the game\u2019s physics engine roars to life in response. I went into Tears of the Kingdom thinking I wouldn\u2019t build much \u2014 I\u2019d just follow the story and get through it; I left feeling like a genius engineer, building all manner of bizarre contraptions (but mostly long bridges) to sail through skies and trundle over mountaintops.\nI still catch my breath remembering that first time diving deep into the darkness of the Depths \u2014 the amazement I felt upon discovering a whole other world underneath the one I knew, filled with skeleton horses and gloom-splattered Bokoblins.\nAnd I remember when I realized where Princess Zelda really was\u2026 and then, many hours later, learning where she really was.\nI never wanted to stop playing Tears of the Kingdom. I did stop, eventually \u2014 the year of 2023 in video games has spoiled us all with hearty meals and sweet desserts \u2014 but I never stopped thinking about it. Every now and then, I picked my Switch back up to seek out another Lightroot, or solve another shrine\u2019s puzzle, until there were none left. And then I\u2019d just wander, collecting ingredients, talking to Great Fairies, imagining the next adventure.\nTears of the Kingdom feels like someone holding my hands very close as they lean in to whisper, with eyes twinkling, \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d The ride was wild; I laughed, I cried. And I can\u2019t wait for the next time, when it\u2019s completely different. \u2014M.

Published 14 October\nImage source, Getty Images\nMicrosoft has sealed its long-awaited deal for Activision Blizzard, and it's paid $69bn (\u00a356bn) for the privilege.\nThat's a lot of money, but what does the deal actually mean for people the next time they pick up a video game?\nWill Call of Duty still be on PlayStation?\nThis is the big question fans keep asking.\nCall of Duty is one of the biggest-selling video game franchises of all time, ranking behind just Mario, Tetris and Pokemon.\nThe good news for Sony fans is it will be 2038 before it's even possible that the game could be an Xbox exclusive.\nThat's because Ubisoft has signed a deal giving it \"cloud gaming\" rights for every Activision Blizzard game, past and future, for 15 years.\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Ubisoft is perhaps best known as the developer and publisher of stealthy action-adventure franchise Assassin's Creed\nMicrosoft had to agree to this to get the deal past UK regulators, who were worried about the company dominating the cloud industry.\nIf you don't know - cloud gaming is when people stream games over the internet - the much-touted \"Netflix for games\".\nThe big subscription services in gaming right now include Ubisoft+, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass.\nSo, will Call of Duty be on Game Pass?\nIn a post on X on Monday, Activision Blizzard said it expects to start adding its titles to Game Pass starting next year - meaning it's quite possible the new Call of Duty, amongst other games, will be playable on Xbox from day one.\nPrior to this deal, Sony was usually the company benefiting from exclusives with Call of Duty - often meaning early access to the game, testing, and bonus features - but now that may well be a thing of the past.\nAnd critically, Microsoft has a habit of making its big blockbuster games available to play on Game Pass, for a monthly fee, on the first day they release.\nImage source, EPA-EFE Image caption, Bethesda, which is owned by Microsoft, launched its new game Starfield in 2023 - but only on Xbox and PC\nIt's up to gamers to decide for themselves whether it's a better deal to buy the game or pay to access it.\nBut it is worth noting this concerned the UK regulator so much it made sure Activision Blizzard games couldn't be streamed exclusively on Xbox for 15 years.\nThat might be because Microsoft has form here - when the hotly anticipated Starfield came out in September 2023 to critical acclaim, it was available exclusively on PC and Xbox, and playable on Game Pass from day one.\nIf games are still on PlayStation, what's in it for Microsoft?\nEven with games still able to appear on PlayStation, it's Microsoft who will be winning out.\nUbisoft may have the streaming rights to Activision Blizzard games for 15 years, but increasingly nowadays game companies make much more money from in-game purchases, also known as microtransactions.\nAccording to Statista, the firm raked in $5.89bn in 2022 from microtransactions, downloadable content and royalties - more than three times the $1.6bn it made from selling the games themselves.\nSony gets around a 30% cut of purchases made in-game, though the exact figures will change between games. Either way - it means an in-game purchase in Call of Duty on PlayStation will now be directly funding a rival.\nWhat do fans think?\nBBC Newsbeat spoke to fans at gaming convention EGX this week to get their take on the deal, with Oliver, 16, saying he thought it might be good news for Call of Duty.\n\"It will just expand the market for gaming, because it's a company with more money to fund the games,\" he said.\nMeanwhile Sophie, who was named Ubisoft's content creator of the year, told the BBC she \"just wants the games to win\".\n\"We want everyone to be able to play video games that they want to play, we want them to be accessible for everyone,\" she said.\n\"Obviously, we're going to have our opinions, but if the end result is good games, that's fine with us.\"\nThis Instagram post cannot be displayed in your browser.

The business also owns King, the Stockholm and London-based makers of Candy Crush Saga.\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Activision Blizzard itself owns many developers, including the maker of Candy Crush Saga\nAltogether this deal means more UK studios coming under the control of Microsoft.\nUkie, the body that represents games companies, told the BBC that this kind of international investment was \"a crucial part\" of the UK industry.

{"title":"Nike misses revenue expectations for the first time in two years, beats on earnings and gross margin","context":"## Nike misses revenue expectations for the first time in two years, beats on earnings and gross margin\n\nNike reported revenue Thursday that fell short of Wall Street's sales expectations for the first time in two years, but it beat on earnings and gross margin estimates, sending its stock soaring in after-hours trading.\nHere's how the sneaker giant performed during its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\nEarnings per share: 94 cents vs. 75 cents expected\nRevenue: $12.94 billion vs. $12.98 billion expected\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended August 31 was $1.45 billion, or 94 cents per share, compared with $1.47 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier.\nSales rose to $12.94 billion, up about 2% from $12.69 billion a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter was just shy of the $12.98 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG.\nNike shares rose about 8% in extended trading Thursday.\nThe retailer maintained its full-year guidance of revenue growth in the mid-single digits and gross margin expansion of 1.4 to 1.6 percentage points.\n\"We're closely monitoring the operating environment, including foreign currency exchange rates, consumer demand over the holiday season, and our second half wholesale order book,\" said finance chief Matthew Friend on a call with analysts.\n\"We are cautiously planning for modest markdown improvements for the balance of the year, given the promotional environment,\" he added.\nFor the second quarter, Nike expects revenue growth to be up slightly versus the prior year and gross margins to grow by about 1 percentage point versus the prior year.\nInvestors have been laser focused on Nike's recovery in China, its relationship with its wholesale partners and how the resumption of student loan payments will impact sales.\nThey're also keen to see Nike's margins recover after bloated inventories, high promotions and supply chain woes contributed to lower profits over the last few quarters.\nDuring the quarter, Nike's gross margin fell about 0.1 percentage points to 44.2%, but it was higher than the 43.7% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. The company attributed the gross margin drop to higher product costs and currency exchange rates, but those trends were offset by price increases, which contributed to the earnings beat.\nSales in China grew by 5% compared to the year-ago period to $1.7 billion, which fell short of the $1.8 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.\nDuring the previous quarter ended May 31, Nike saw China sales jump 16% compared to the year-ago period. But the numbers were against easy comparisons because the region was still under Covid-related lockdown orders during the prior year.\nWhile Nike remains bullish on China, the region's economic recovery has so far been a mixed bag. Following a sluggish July, retail sales picked up during the month of August to rise 4.6% compared to the prior year, beating expectations of a 3% growth forecast by Reuters.\n\"We feel good about the market there and our position,\" said CEO John Donahoe, adding he's traveled to China twice in the last four months. \"Frankly, a couple things stand out. One, sport is back in China, you can just feel it, and that gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment, regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there.\"\nNike saw sales jumps in every region besides North America, its largest market by revenue. Sales in North America fell 2% from the year-ago period to $5.42 billion, just above the $5.39 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.\nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales were up 8% at $3.61 billion. That compared with the $3.51 billion analysts had expected. Sales in its Latin America and Asia Pacific unit came in 2% higher at $1.57 billion, just shy of the $1.59 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.\nThe Converse brand, on the other hand, fell well short of expectations for a second quarter in a row. Sales came in at $588 million, down 9% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts had expected sales to be about $660 million, according to StreetAccount.\nNike's direct channel, which includes its owned stores and its digital channel, led the retailer's growth during the quarter and was up 6% compared to the prior year. In June, the company noticed that shoppers were shifting towards its stores over its digital channels, signaling consumers are getting closer to pre-pandemic shopping habits.\n\"We continue to see that consumers want to connect directly and personally with our brands and in fact, member engagement within our direct business is up double digits versus the prior year with increasing average order values,\" said Friend.\n\"Our stores delivered an especially strong quarter with traffic up double digits from last year, and members driving an increasing share of our business as consumers shifted from our digital to physical channels... Our team was nimble in transitioning inventory to capture higher full-price sales across our entire store fleet,\" he said.\nWhen it comes to its wholesale revenues, Nike's relationship with those partners have been rocky. As the company has pivoted to a direct-to-consumer model, it has focused on driving sales online and in its stores at the expense of its wholesale accounts.\nHowever, as Nike grappled with excess inventories throughout 2023, it relied on those partners to move through that merchandise. It has now restored its relationship with both Macy's and DSW \u2013 accounts that it previously cut in favor of its DTC strategy.\nSome analysts expected Nike's wholesale revenue to be sluggish during the quarter because excess inventories have been a problem throughout the retail industry \u2013 and some wholesalers are being more particular in what they order to avoid another backlog.\nWholesale revenue during the quarter was flat compared to the year-ago period at $7 billion.\nBoth Donahoe and Friend made it clear to analysts that Nike is ready to meet customers in all channels \u2014 including through wholesalers and directly. The retailer shouted out Dick's Sporting Goods as one of its key partners and noted that it's still in the process of resetting its business with Footlocker , which has seen two quarters in a row of plunging sales and profits.\nDespite the shift in how it's working with wholesalers, Nike insisted that direct sales will pave the way to its future growth.\n\"Ultimately, we have a segmented portfolio of strong partners across price points and channels. With no single partner representing more than a mid-single digit of Nike's total business,\" said Friend.\n\"While the ultimate landing spot of digital and direct isn't as clear, we do believe we're going to be a more direct and a more digital company, and a more profitable company,\" he said. \"And there's a channel mix and channel profitability opportunity that comes with that as well.\"\nMeanwhile, inventories fell 10% to $8.7 billion. The drop was driven by a decrease in units but offset by product mix and higher manufacturing and production costs.\n\"On the whole, we're very comfortable with the level of inventory in the marketplace in relation to the retail sales that we're seeing as we begin increasing levels of wholesale sell in our second half,\" said Friend.\nAmid decades-high inflation rates, consumers have been pulling back on apparel and footwear. With the resumption of student loan payments looming ahead, some analysts expect those sectors to take an even greater hit.\nJefferies conducted a survey on U.S. consumer spending and found 54% of respondents plan to spend less on apparel and accessories. Meanwhile, 46% plan to spend less on footwear, which doesn't bode well for Nike.\nIt's still too early to gauge the impact of student loan payments on Nike. Its first quarter ended in late August, and payments aren't set to resume until October.\nDuring the quarter, footwear sales rose 4% to $8.4 billion, making up about 68% of Nike's total sales. Apparel was down 1% at $3.4 billion.\nCorrection: Nike's gross margin fell 0.1 percentage points. An earlier version of this story misstated that figure.\n\nThis article was published by Cnbc | World Business News Leader on 2023-09-28 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":215}
{"title":"Why Gogoro picked India as its new go-to market","context":"## Why Gogoro picked India as its new go-to market\n\nWhy Gogoro picked India as its new go-to market The Taiwanese company aims to put billions of dollars into the world's biggest two-wheeler market\nGogoro co-founder and CEO Horace Luke wants to \u201cgo big\u201d in India even as the Taiwanese company faces challenges in its home country.\nThe potential of India, it seems, is simply too ripe to ignore and not just because it\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest two-wheeler market, where 15 million to 20 million new two-wheelers hit the road every year. Luke also sees the world\u2019s most populous country as a launch pad that will accelerate its global expansion in other markets. It\u2019s not a bad tactic, considering India is already on a spree to become a competitive manufacturing hub for all major international brands and products, from smartphones to satellites.\nEarlier this month, Gogoro made its first commercial entry into India with the introduction of its battery-swapping network and smartscooters after running pilots and investing millions of dollars in the country. Talking on the sidelines with Luke at the company\u2019s event, it\u2019s clear his ambitions stretch beyond this initial debut.\nFounded in 2011 by former HTC executives Luke and Matt Taylor, Gogoro considers itself the Android of all EVs. It offers its proprietary technology to other automobile manufacturers alongside selling its own branded scooters with swappable batteries. The company already operates in markets in China, Indonesia, Singapore, Israel and the Philippines \u2014 alongside its hometown in Taiwan.\nThe company has picked India as a strategic market from where it can reach a number of new users and enter new markets, starting with neighboring country Nepal, Luke said at the company\u2019s launch in New Delhi.\nThe new developments are on the heels of Gogoro\u2019s earlier India announcements, including the early battery-swapping pilot in Delhi, a partnership with Belrise Industries to invest a total of $2.5 billion in Maharashtra to build its battery-swapping infrastructure and network in the western peninsular state and $25 million investment in electric fleet management startup Zypp Electric.\nGogoro is in talks with various local and global players to expand its business and presence in India, Luke stated without sharing any names. The company is already working with domestic manufacturers to produce its components locally, which it currently assembles at a facility in Maharashtra in partnership with Foxconn. It is also looking to partner with Indian and global automobile manufacturers who can deploy its technology, helping to grow its business in the country.\nThe company has about 11 vehicle manufacturers in Taiwan that are building vehicles of different sizes and configurations based on its standard battery size, the executive said. These include the likes of Suzuki, Yamaha, and Aeon Motor, among others. He indicated that some of these may come to India along with Gogoro\u2019s swappable battery technology over time.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s waiting for me to bring the network,\u201d Luke said without divulging specific details. \u201cOnce the network goes live, [the partners will] bring in their capacity and capability.\u201d\nIn April 2021, Gogoro partnered with Indian two-wheeler giant Hero MotoCorp to roll out its battery-swapping network in the country. However, that deal has not yielded any results.\nWhen asked how Gogoro will utilize its partnership with Hero MotoCorp and why it did not choose the local automobile player for its debut and instead introduced its own range of smartscooters in the country, Luke shared a sketchy response and said the top management of Hero MotoCorp did wish him success before the launch.\n\u201c[Hero MotoCorp\u2019s] brand and company as a whole is very B2C focused . . . As we launch with a B2B focus first, we keep them abreast of all the stuff that\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re an open platform. One day, they\u2019ll be ready [to] launch a vehicle using our system. But it\u2019s really a chicken and egg [situation]. I need to prove that there is a platform that is ready before they actually can go in, come in and do that.\u201d\nMimicking Taiwan model\nGogoro plans to simulate its Taiwan growth in India by launching 30 stations in Delhi by the first quarter of 2024. The company began its journey in Taipei with the same number of stations but has since expanded to 12,500 stations that serve around 600,000 vehicles throughout Taiwan. It is open to making many more investments in India to reach that level and even grow bigger over time.\n\u201cIf you think about Pan India, we are talking about several billion dollars easily by 2030\u20132032,\u201d Luke asserted.\nHe informed reporters at the launch that Gogoro\u2019s battery-swapping system captures 93% of all electric vehicles in Taiwan \u2014 of which about 80% use its own branded vehicles. The company is not limited to two-wheelers in its home country but also offers its swapping-battery technology to players that run auto-rickshaws.\nNonetheless, the growth of Gogoro is stagnant and is even dropping in Taiwan, as Luke admitted to TechCrunch.\nIn its recent earnings report, the Nasdaq-listed company mentioned a 10.2% year-on-year drop in its revenue of $91.8 million, resulting in a net loss of $3.1 million, down from a net income of $56.4 million in the same quarter last year.\nHe underlined there were a couple of reasons for seeing a decline in its financials and dropping its business in Taiwan. First, he said, it was due to a lobbying effort against the speed of electric vehicle adoption after the 2020 elections. Second, the country took some time to return from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cTaiwan has always been a pilot for us,\u201d Luke stated. \u201cIt has always been a market where we used to develop the technology, develop the system so that when we do come to India, we\u2019re ready. And so that\u2019s where the pivot point now is.\u201d\nHe compared that gasoline in Taiwan has been subsidized to the level that it is available at an average price of 0.85 cents per liter, significantly less than the average price of $1.4 per liter in India, above the global price of $1.22.\nAlthough Gogoro is optimistic about its India launch, the country has a relatively small market for EVs, accounting for only 3.7% of the country\u2019s total automotive market. Electric scooters in the country capture 90% of the total EV sales, but that is just about 5% of the overall two-wheeler market. The Indian government has allocated billions of dollars in subsidies and discounts to attract manufacturers and commuters for EVs. However, these benefits only remain in place for a short time, and some disruption due to the changes in their structure has recently been seen in the electric two-wheeler market.\nYet, Gogoro \u2014 similar to other players in the EV market \u2014 is bullish since the Indian government has targeted 30% EV adoption by 2030. Gogoro\u2019s approach to considering India as a manufacturing hub will also likely appeal to the government and help the company shift some of its production from China and enter new markets.\nIt\u2019s important to note that although Gogoro\u2019s revenue dropped significantly in the last quarter, its battery-swapping service continued to grow, with a revenue of $33.6 million, up 10.4% year-on-year. As the company looks to collaborate with other vehicle manufacturers in India for its battery-swapping technology, it could be a mutually beneficial move for both Gogoro and automobile players. Indian automotive players actively seek solutions to reduce charging time and offer efficient alternatives to ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. By providing its technology to vehicle manufacturers, Gogoro can tap into this need and increase its battery-swapping service revenues.\nA recent report jointly created by Bain & Company and Blume Ventures forecast that electric two-wheelers without batteries can reduce the upfront cost of vehicles by 40% to 50%, attracting price-sensitive Indian customers. However, it also warned that building a battery-swapping ecosystem in India will be challenging in the near term and suggested maintaining a battery-swapping inventory for top SKUs across manufacturers, identifying customer segments to target, and establishing \u201cwalled-garden\u201d partnerships to support swappable-battery systems.\nAn investor told TechCrunch that to really succeed, the market needs interoperability and standardization in battery swapping, similar to how we have USB-C in phones nowadays. But for Gogoro, it is just a start to explore how big of a dent it can make in the overall EV market with its available battery-swapping solution.\n\u201cI got an entire ecosystem I need to bring in. It took us a little while to get ready, and it will take us a little while to ramp up. And I\u2019m not fooling anybody that this thing is going to [happen] overnight,\u201d Luke said. \u201cIndia\u2019s a huge place. There\u2019s a lot of different use cases. The price-performance people ask for is very high . . . So, through making more of the components and making more parts in India, with our Indian suppliers, we\u2019ll definitely start, and then more and more localization would certainly help.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Jagmeet Singh, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-19 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":216}
{"title":"Office rents in Israel stay firm - for now","context":"## Office rents in Israel stay firm - for now\n\nLess than a month before the war, \"Globes\" reported a huge deal in which Amnon Shashua's unicorn AI21 Labs announced it was leasing 7,000 square meters for NIS 15 million annually in Tel Aviv's Da Vinci project.\nIt will now be interesting to see when the next such big deal for office space is signed in Tel Aviv following the impact of the Israel-Hamas war. Sources in the income-producing property sector in Israel say that over the past few weeks there has been some interest in the sector, although mainly for smaller deals involving hundreds of square meters each.\nThe reports: \"No change in rents\nAzrieli Group (TASE: AZRG), is one of the biggest companies in the sector, with 15 office buildings comprising 632,000 square meters of space and 97% occupancy. Last week Azrieli published its financial results for the third quarter of 2023 saying that the company had not been impacted by the war. However the company added that due to the uncertainty about the length of the war and its development, it could not assess the future impact of the war on business activities in Israel in general and on the company in particular.\nAmot Investments (TASE: AMOT), another of the biggest companies in the income-producing property sector, has 1.15 million square meters of office space for leasing with 93.5% occupancy with a further six projects in various stages of construction. Amot wrote, \"In the third quarter several new contracts were signed including the exercising of options and the renewal of immaterial contracts for 14,000 square meters of space for an unchanged rent.\"\nAmot raises concerns about the continuation of the war which would lead to damage to the economy, including to the company's tenants. The report says, \"The uncertainty that existed in the profitable real estate market in Israel even before the outbreak of the war and that was felt in the moderation in demand and the lengthening of the negotiations to close agreements, has intensified following the war.\n\"The company's management estimates that given that the war will focus only on the southern front and the duration of the fighting at the current intensity will not exceed two to three months, then the effect of the war is not material on the company's business. In the aforementioned situation, the company's management estimates that despite the damage to its revenue, which cannot yet be accurately estimated, they will be reflected in the company's annual NOI and FFO within the forecast. \"In the company's assessment, the continuation of the fighting for a long time and\/or a full conflict on the northern border front (or on other fronts) will result in a significant and wider damage to the economy, including deepening the damage to private consumption and businesses, including the company's tenants, and as a result will cause a decrease in payments and changes in other economic parameters.\"\nThe supply: Millions of square meters between Kfar Saba and Rishon Lezion\nEven before the war, the industry was talking about there being too large a supply of office space. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, between 2020 and 2022, construction was begun on 3.56 million square meters of office space.\nAvison Young Israel co-CEO Guy Amosi says, \"I am now doing four or five deals for companies that must rent space. Not large-scale deals. There are a few companies that end contracts or companies that grow and want more space. On the other hand, Midtown was written off when it was built next to Azrieli and now these are the most sought-after towers. Everything is a question of how long will it take to occupy. In the end, everything will be occupied.\"\nAmosi says that there are many areas in the central region, which in his opinion he fears could remain empty for a long time before they are occupied. He says, \"A company asked us to find them 15,000 square meters and asked us to map out options for offices from Rishon Lezion to Kfar Saba. They did not look in Tel Aviv where the prices are high, and two years ago contracts were closed for NIS 150 per square meter. We found that there are a huge number of projects in the area between Rosh Laz and Kfar Saba. Millions of square meters are being built and I really don't know who will occupy all these areas.\"\nIn his opinion, there is an advantage to offices in a good location, like Park Naimi in the central region (Messubim Junction) near Roads 4 and 1. \"It sits in a good location.\" But Amosi is bothered by offices built without an anchor tenant to begin with. \"Without a tenant for which the building is being specifically constructed for marketing. Even in Petah Tikva they are building half a million square meters of new office space.\"\nThere was Covid and then there was a crisis in high-tech that led to a chain reaction of reduced spending. Companies began to check every investment. Along with this, interest rates rose and inflation is rampant all over the world. We are not a bubble. Above all this, comes the war. However, in general, real estate works in waves and the wave will come again.\"\nThe war: \"I expected a longer stoppage\"\nNatalie Marshall, the owner of Marshall Strategic Real Estate marketing talks about a restored interest in offices. \"I expected there to be a longer stoppage in the office market. There was a stoppage of office marketing for a month, but about two weeks ago movement recommenced. There is also seasonality in the office sector - in July-August and during the holidays every year there is a stoppage.\n\"In my opinion, in an ironic way, all of us in the public have now realized that we have nowhere to go and we only have one country. In the last six months, with the protests and the reform, people did not know what to do and even thought of leaving. But we all understood that we have one home and must keep it as the best possible place. I see there has been a movement of people interested in renting offices in the last two and a half weeks and the market is alive and kicking. There are many meetings and tours of the area. At the moment we are seeing companies searching for 10,000 or 15,000 square meters.\"\nNewmark Natam VP real estate services Or Ben Zvi Klein explains that there are even companies interested in the southern region and there is a market for deals and factories in the region. He says, \"We managed to do such deals, such as lawyers, small high-tech companies, call centers, warehouses moving from Ofakim and Sderot towards Beer Sheva and Kiryat Gat on short contracts, so as soon as the area is restored they will return.\"\nBen Zvi Klein says \"In the north, I am marketing a building in Nof Hagalil. All the areas in Metula, Kiryat Shmona, etc. are not areas for offices\" says Ben Zvi Klein.\nRents: \"Property owners have not cut rents\"\nProperty developer Miki Naimi, who is building the large office park near the Messubim Interchange, does not sound bothered. He says, \"We are continuing to progress. Real estate is not for a year. I am not afraid of the situation and the war will also end. We are currently in advanced talks with three companies that will join us in Naimi Park.\n\"We have built 140,000 square meters out of 350,000 square meters and now we are developing another 140,000 square meters of office space with 100,000 square meters of parking lots designed by MYS architects. Our location is the most central in the country, so I am not afraid to plan and build four more buildings\".\nNaimi says that the first building to be occupied, with an area of 35,000 square meters, \"Is mostly marketed and there is already set to be occupancy.\" The first company to move in as early as January is Audicodes, which has leased 10,500 square meters and is implementing finishing works. \"In March-April, additional companies will enter. Sheba Medical Center Tel Hashomer will also enter there and leased 2,600 square meters and will increase to 5,300 square meters,\" he says.\nBen Zvi Klein thinks that as in other crises, when the crisis breaks everything halts but then we see buds of everything returning to work. But he also adds that volumes are low but no different than before the war.\nBen Zvi Klein says, \"\"In the first two weeks of the war, people were in the market but the market was at a standstill and once again people started to wonder, what will happen now and where are we going and how long will it take. It reminded me of the feeling during Covid, when there were ghost offices and nothing was happening. As time goes by, people come back to the offices. They really want to leave home and get to work. Most offices have emergency shelters, and relative to residential areas, most of them are protected. I live in Tel Aviv and during the fighting, when schools were closed, my children came with me to the office, because there is a shelter there and the house only has a stairwell.\n\"In the last three weeks, we feel that the market is returning to activity - but we entered this war when the office market was already stuttering. There were no huge deals, because there are no huge hiring in high-tech or big deals of tens of thousands of meters for the big companies. There are small and medium-sized deals. There are quite a few inquiries from high-tech and service companies looking for 1,000-2,000 square meters who want to expand. We have such inquiries in Haifa, Tel Aviv and Rehovot. There is some revival in the market, but property owners have not cut rents.\"\nCompanies subletting are under pressure\nSo if there is huge supply and a fall in demand for offices, why aren't rents falling?\nAmosi says, \"The prices have fallen by about 10% at most. Those cutting rents are those who bought buildings in purchase groups like BSR City where many individuals bought as a profitable investment. The construction of the building is finished and suddenly the payments such as management fees, mortgage and property taxes drop. In such cases there are people who are thinking of selling, and in these places we may see a drop in prices.\"\nBen Zvi Klein says that prices won't go down because people have learned lessons from the past. He says, \"Everyone was burned by Covid. A property owner who gave a discount at the beginning of Covid realized this by the end of Covid, when the office opposite the one leased out at a discount of NIS 100 per square meter was being rented out for NIS 140 per square meter. The property owners are not under pressure because they rented most of their space during the peak periods of 2021-2022. Those who are under pressure may be companies that are trying to sublet their properties and here we see attractiveness in prices for fully furnished properties.\n\"We have been living here for years with fighting in the background. If the war continues, people may want to break a contract. As the economy returns to work because kindergartens and schools are opening, there is a general feeling of an economy returning to normal alongside the war, and it is possible to start going to work. After Covid, there was talk about what would happen and whether people would return to work and in the end everyone returned to work from the office. I am optimistic about the office market in the future.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on December 3, 2023.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023.\n\nThis article, authored by Anat-Daniely Lev, was published by Globes English | Israel Business Arena on 2023-12-03 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":217}
{"title":"'Too big to fail' Egypt faces economic crisis but has an anti-Gaza refugee policy. Israel and the U.S. hope that will change","context":"## 'Too big to fail' Egypt faces economic crisis but has an anti-Gaza refugee policy. Israel and the U.S. hope that will change\n\nThe war between Israel and Hamas has turned the spotlight on Egypt\u2019s role as a regional powerbroker, potentially winning it Western support as it tries to escape a grinding economic crisis.\nWith long-held ties to Israel and a border with Gaza, Egypt\u2019s stance is shaping up as key to the fate of any refugees and a sustained flow of aid for the besieged territory\u2019s 2 million residents after Israel cut off crucial supplies in response to Hamas\u2019s deadly Oct. 7 assault.\nThat opens up opportunities for the most populous Arab nation as it wrestles with its worst economic outlook in decades and President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi prepares for elections in less than two months\u2019 time. A host of domestic and regional considerations, however, are seen ruling out any refugee deal.\nThe Israeli government has spoken to counterparts in several countries about Egypt temporarily housing Palestinians fleeing the violence in Gaza, according to officials with knowledge of the matter. Israel has suggested they could be moved to tent camps in the Sinai Peninsula \u2014 funded by the United Nations and the US \u2014 and then returned once military operations end, said the people. It\u2019s unclear if Israel has put the idea directly to Egypt.\n\u201cClearly the hope on Israel and the US\u2019s side had been that Egypt would accept economic incentives, at a time when it is suffering an economic crisis, to allow Gazans into Egypt,\u201d said Mirette Mabrouk, director of the Egypt program at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.\nYet \u201cthere is little to no constituency for going against decades of policy on not allowing Palestinian displacement,\u201d she said, while the inducements \u201cmight wind up becoming a political liability, especially in an election year.\u201d\nAll the same, multiple economists, bankers and investors Bloomberg spoke with this month in Morocco during annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank saw Egypt as likely to receive some economic backing, whatever its refugee stance. The crisis has reminded global players of the North African nation\u2019s status as a regional linchpin, entrenching the idea it\u2019s too big to fail.\nEgypt, which reached a deal with the IMF in December, is already in talks on boosting that rescue program to over $5 billion from $3 billion, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg this month.\nIt\u2019s possible the IMF\u2019s key shareholders in the US and Europe may pressure the Washington-based lender to soften its requirements and move ahead with the program despite Cairo\u2019s slow pace of reforms, according to Riccardo Fabiani, project director for North Africa with Crisis Group.\nThat\u2019s also because the current conflict serves to highlight the growing instability on all sides of Egypt, in Libya, Sudan and now in Gaza. It confronts the US and Europe with the need to ensure that \u201cCairo remains a stable and reliable partner in the area\u201d that \u201cdeserves external support,\u201d Fabiani said.\nThere was evidence of that international focus on Saturday when El-Sisi hosted what\u2019s billed as a \u201cSummit for Peace\u201d in Cairo, with Middle East and European leaders in attendance.\nDiplomatic Onslaught\nThe recent flurry of diplomacy centered on Cairo has marked something of a return to Egypt\u2019s traditional role figuring prominently in every discussion over power politics across the region in the latter half of the 20th century.\nIt rallied Arab forces and led the 1973 attack on Israel that triggered the Yom Kippur war, before the two countries signed a peace treaty and established full diplomatic relations in 1980, going on to become strategic allies.\nIn the days since Hamas, which the US and Europe designate a terrorist group, launched its attack on Israel, El-Sisi has been courted by a succession of world leaders. US President Joe Biden reaffirmed the two countries\u2019 \u201cenduring, strategic partnership\u201d in a call. Visiting Chancellor Olaf Scholz praised German-Egyptian unity in working to prevent a Middle East \u201cconflagration.\u201d Chinese President Xi Jinping met Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly in Beijing.\nThe war \u201cunderscores the important role Egypt has always played vis-a-vis security in and around Gaza,\u201d said Robert Satloff, executive director at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\nThat\u2019s not lost on European governments that woke up to Egypt\u2019s importance as a regional gas producer after Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year. European officials visited to assess Egypt\u2019s potential as a gas supplier \u2014 with Israel\u2019s help \u2014 to supplant at least some Russian supplies.\nThose same governments are now courting El-Sisi for help in alleviating the pressure on Gaza. But he has rejected any suggestion Egypt host Gazan refugees, suggesting Israel should instead take in Palestinians to its Negev desert. \u201cThey can transport Palestinians there until Israel implements its announced plan to destroy Hamas,\u201d he said Wednesday.\nEgypt already hosts some 9 million refugees and other migrants from countries including Syria, Sudan, Yemen and Libya. Opening a route for Palestinians may also present a new security risk in the Sinai peninsula, where the army has only just managed to get a handle on its fight with Islamist militants.\nJordan has also refused to accept more Palestinians and it\u2019s unlikely Egypt would become a regional exception and take in refugees many suspect may never be let back into Gaza. That would risk being seen in the Arab world as facilitating another mass displacement and betraying the Palestinian cause all Arab countries vocally espouse.\nAlso, while Egypt could absorb a certain number of people, the domestic political consequences would be \u201chuge,\u201d said the Washington Institute\u2019s Satloff. \u201cThe political leadership considers this a red line not to be crossed and would prefer to face worsening financial distress than accept a significant number of refugees.\u201d\nThere is a precedent of sorts for Cairo winning favors as a regional war raged.\nEgypt secured forgiveness of half its $20.2 billion debt owed to the US and allies in 1991 \u2014 one of the most generous incidences of debt relief creditor nations have granted \u2014 in exchange for support for the anti-Iraq coalition during the Gulf war.\nThe US wanted to reward Egypt\u2019s President Hosni Mubarak for his pivotal role in lining up Arab nations against Saddam Hussein and to reimburse Egypt for heavy financial losses in the war. Egypt also sent armed forces to participate.\nReplicating that scenario would be difficult though. Back then there was general consensus that since Kuwait had been invaded, it needed to be supported, and while Egypt\u2019s participation \u201cwas not met with any great joy in military circles, it was not a particularly hard sell and the debt relief was an immense added incentive,\u201d according to the Middle East Institute\u2019s Mabrouk.\nNot so today, not least because Egypt\u2019s commitment would not be comparable with its burden in 1991 when it was the second-largest source of manpower in the US-led coalition, and so it couldn\u2019t expect anything like a similar level of economic assistance, Satloff said.\nWay Out\nOne way out of the dilemma may be for Egypt to offer Saudi Arabia a role co-leading the Palestinian issue for the Arab world in return for financial support, according to strategists. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aware of domestic anger at Israel, might welcome such an initiative to strengthen his regional profile, though he was absent from Saturday\u2019s summit.\nThe fluid situation may offer Egypt other opportunities to take a mediating role that could be rewarded, Crisis Group\u2019s Fabiani said.\nFor now, Egypt will try to play a constructive part \u201cin the hope that its contribution will be acknowledged by its international and regional partners and potentially rewarded economically,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article, authored by Mirette Magdy, Bloomberg, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-22 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":218}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nThey sang the name of Erik ten Hag\u2019s predecessor. Not in a gesture of dissent, but as a reminder of a time when Manchester United were Europe\u2019s best and an evening without which a certain Norwegian would never have become their manager two decades later. After all, who put the ball in the Germans\u2019 net? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. But that was a different millennium, a different United. Nostalgia underpinned Solskjaer\u2019s management. Ten Hag cannot call upon his personal history in such a way; the Champions League final he almost reached was with Ajax. His past does not offer the protection that means his name will always be sung at Old Trafford.\nAnd, 24 years after Solskjaer\u2019s stunning intervention, another United Champions League campaign finished against Bayern Munich. Not in glory, but ignominy. Like Solskjaer, Kingsley Coman has a winner in a Champions League final; this time the winger finished off United, condemning them to a seventh home defeat of the season. In a sense, it may have been the most respectable: United were vaguely competent on the night, but utterly incompetent over the course of a wretched campaign.\nThere was no hint of a repeat of their most famous comeback against Bayern, ensuring Solskjaer\u2019s name will forever be bracketed with Teddy Sheringham\u2019s. There was not even the sense of heroic failure that accompanied their quarter-final exit to Bayern in 2010. There was just crushing failure. Because it wasn\u2019t Bayern who eliminated them. It was Galatasaray, who won at Old Trafford and scored six goals over 180 minutes against United. It was FC Copenhagen, who qualified instead of them. Rasmus Hojlund\u2019s former club will be in the last 16. His current one won\u2019t. Copenhagen will be the anomalies in the draw, the outsiders with the spot that had seemed reserved for United.\nManchester United\u2019s defeat means they miss out on a spot in the Europa League (PA)\nInstead, they are cast out of continental competition altogether. Europe\u2019s sinking superpower have become just the fourth English team to prop up a Champions League group when it concluded. There was something predictable about the manner of their demise; their defence was unlocked by Harry Kane, with a lovely flick. The England captain is the forward United neglected to bid for in the summer. The one they did buy, Hojlund, has at least struck in the Champions League but in domestic competitions he has been outscored 18-0 by Kane.\nYet a rookie centre-forward is not the culprit in chief. For Ten Hag, this has been a chastening setback; with Sir Jim Ratcliffe set to finalise his investment, with United listing in the Premier League, the chances are the Dutchman has managed them in the Champions League for the last time.\nGo back four years and it required a 96th minute goal by Lucas Moura to stop him from reaching the final. Now the less heralded Lukas Lerager signalled United\u2019s demise, putting Copenhagen ahead against Galatasaray when United needed a draw to preserve their own chances of qualification; that, and a victory over Bayern. Which, as the German champions have not lost in 40 group-stage games in this competition and United have not beaten anyone resembling a top team this season, always felt unlikely.\nThis was far from their worst performance of the season, nowhere near as bad as Bournemouth or Crystal Palace or Newcastle, or the other defeat to Newcastle. They were not as self-destructive as they had been in Denmark and Turkey and at home to Galatasaray. But they still lost.\nHarry Maguire\u2019s injury forced him off the pitch as 36-year-old Jonny Evans replaced him (EPA)\nAnd they still went out, with four points, in fourth place. Go back a couple of months and Raphael Varane had said United could win the Champions League. On a night when Ten Hag seemed to revise his opinion of the quadruple Champions League winner, the defender may need a rethink. Instead, United won a lone game in it and even that required a penalty save to deny FC Copenhagen a draw.\nVarane was summoned from his inexplicable exile, after a 10-game absence when both Luke Shaw and Jonny Evans were preferred at centre-back to a World Cup winner. He performed with an assurance to make his omission all the odder, but it has scarcely been the only U-turn in selection; with Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay, Ten Hag is compiling a group who were first out of his plans and then back in. For a manager who likes to project an image of strong, decisiveness leadership, he has had to reverse course rather too often. But then his team are going backwards.\nWhen Coman scored, United became the first Premier League side to concede 15 goals in a Champions League group stage. When Maguire hobbled off, holding his groin, and Evans came on, United had a man who played in United\u2019s 2007-08 Champions League-winning campaign, dragooned into service 16 years later. They will always have the past at Old Trafford, but Evans may be consigned to it; perhaps, in time, Ten Hag, too.\n\nThis article, authored by Richard Jolly, was published by The Independent - Sports on 2023-12-12 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":219}
{"title":"McRae reveals hidden message he carried under collar of his grand final shirt","context":"## McRae reveals hidden message he carried under collar of his grand final shirt\n\nAdams and McStay \u2013 who arrived from the Lions in the off-season as an unrestricted free agent \u2013 leaned on each other to cope with the difficult moment, and needed some privacy to deal with their personal misfortune before they could share in the team\u2019s raucous celebrations. McStay may need as many as eight weeks to recover from the high-grade medial collateral ligament strain he suffered in the club\u2019s preliminary final win. Collingwood\u2019s injured recruit Dan McStay at training before the grand final. Credit: Eddie Jim \u201cWe shed a few tears and a bit of emotion, then we brushed it off and said, \u2018Let\u2019s get on with it and go celebrate with the boys\u2019. It was a great night,\u201d Adams said. John Noble was another sad story, playing every game in the home-and-away season, only to be dropped for Collingwood\u2019s qualifying final clash with Melbourne and never forcing his way back in.\nNathan Murphy, who took no further part in the grand final after being concussed in a clash with Brisbane\u2019s Linc McCarthy, spared a thought for all three players amid the post-match chaos. \u201cIt was pretty emotional seeing them. You go from one high like myself to a low like theirs,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put yourself in their shoes, and see that, but they\u2019re so good. They\u2019re turning it into a positive, and they\u2019re just happy for everyone else\u2019s success, so it\u2019s awesome.\u201d The trio\u2019s grand final heartbreak sparked renewed debate about whether every player on the list should receive a premiership medallion, or at least those who played a certain number of games. First-year Magpie Oleg Markov has experienced both sides of the ledger. He played in Saturday\u2019s premiership, but missed out on all three Richmond flags (2017, 2019 and 2020) despite playing senior games in each of those years. Markov is \u201ca big advocate\u201d for all players being recognised.\n\u201cThe best thing we can do is wrap our arms around them, and just let him feel what we sort of feel,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the other side of the fence, and it is hard because you\u2019re seeing all your friends succeed and sort of living the dream that you aspire to have, but I know it makes people hungrier. I know the boys who missed out will be the ones who are training the house down, and pushing the boys who have seen the mountain top. They\u2019re going to motivate the boys to try and see it again.\u201d \u2018Incredibly sore\u2019: Howe played out decider with rib injury Peter Ryan\nThis wasn\u2019t the type of \u201ccar crash\u201d injury Jeremy Howe has suffered before, but it was brutal nonetheless. The high-flying Magpie has revealed he played out the grand final in pain after he was floored by a bone-crunching knock to the ribs from Lions forward Charlie Cameron during the last quarter. Jeremy Howe was collected by Charlie Cameron late in the game Credit: Getty Images\nCameron crashed into Howe as he cleared the ball from Collingwood\u2019s defence, leaving him gasping on the ground with badly bruised ribs. The Magpies defender is accustomed to extreme pain, having broken his arm in six places after a sickening midair collision in the opening round of the season. This pain was tolerable by comparison, and he got up and played out the match, helping Collingwood hold on to a four-point win in one of the great grand finals. \u201cThe incident late in the game with Charlie ... He managed to hit me relatively late, it was probably in play, [but I] got a down-field free kick,\u201d Howe told Channel Nine on Sunday. Jeremy Howe\u2019s rib injury did not prevent him celebrating Collingwood\u2019s premiership. Credit: Getty\n\u201cThe ribs are incredibly sore but I think if we lost they\u2019d be sorer. \u201cI\u2019ve got six months to get them right. I can tolerate the pain for now. I bounced out of bed regardless.\u201d Leading into the finals Howe said the bone had protruded from his arm when he crashed-landed in round one, describing the excruciating pain, and he came back from a horrific knee injury in 2020. Did Markov join his pole-vaulting father as a world champ? Oleg Markov is revelling in his fairytale ascension from the AFL scrapheap to Collingwood premiership hero, eight months after trialling with Carlton.\nAny further proof required for how beloved the mustachioed dasher is among the Magpie army was delivered emphatically on Sunday at club headquarters, where fans chanted his name, soccer style. \u201cAt first, when it started, I was a bit embarrassed, but I think since embracing it and sort of smiling, I kind of enjoy it now,\u201d Markov told The Age. \u201cI\u2019m super grateful that I\u2019ve got a little chant like that, and hopefully, it\u2019s a little legacy I can continue, and I\u2019m just happy the Magpie army are looking after me. I feel like they\u2019re always on my side, no matter what mistake I make ... if anything, they motivate me to continue to take the game on and just be my true self.\u201d Markov felt like he was cheating on Collingwood when he began training with the Blues, after finding out the Pies overlooked him for what was then their final list spot.\nThat followed Gold Coast delisting the 27-year-old, who also played 23 games for Richmond. There was interest in him at the time, but he feared his career might be over. \u201cI went through the national draft and no one looked into me, so there were technically 17 clubs that didn\u2019t really want me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, to be honest, maybe 18, after I didn\u2019t get the last list spot at Collingwood, but I\u2019m glad the stars aligned the way they did.\u201d In a twist of fate, defender Charlie Dean re-fractured his right foot at training, opening another list spot for Collingwood to snatch Markov back from Carlton \u2013 and the rest is history. \u201cHaving trained at Collingwood for two months, I felt like I was almost doing the dirty on \u2018Fly\u2019 [Craig McRae], going behind his back \u2013 I was almost like a cheater,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was very respectful and understanding, and it probably allowed me to open myself up and be vulnerable to that football club. I\u2019m super grateful for them showing interest in me, in the first place.\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve signed with [Collingwood] and on the dotted lines, I\u2019ve agreed to hate Carlton, but there\u2019s a bit of me that is really grateful and appreciative to them.\u201d McRae revealed post-grand final he wrote \u201c44 sons\u201d under his shirt collar, and he urged his players before the season started to come up with something similar for themselves. Markov kept his message private, but said the idea was for them to pick words that summed up how they wanted to be remembered. \u201cIt was almost like writing a tombstone or eulogy for yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cWe picked one or two words that we wanted to live by. Everyone had their own, so some people chose really powerful words to do with football and others chose words to do with life, or whether it was repaying someone.\n\u201cFly spoke about his being the 44 sons. Hearing that, it definitely made me realise all year that\u2019s how I felt, and I can vouch for all the boys \u2013 that\u2019s how we felt. We felt like he was a father figure for us more than a coach.\u201d Markov\u2019s actual father, Dmitri, famously won the men\u2019s pole vault at the 2001 world championships, so his role in the Magpies\u2019 triumph continues the family\u2019s sporting success. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky. Dad thinks it\u2019s a bit harder in a team sport because everyone has to perform,\u201d Markov said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey, AFL is only in Australia, but, technically, you are a world champ,\u2019 so I think I\u2019ve matched him for now. I\u2019d like to get another one, and hopefully, I can one-up him, but I think he\u2019s got the cake at the moment.\u201d Pies\u2019 premiership \u2018just the beginning\u2019: Maynard\nMarc McGowan\nBrayden Maynard has warned Collingwood\u2019s breakthrough premiership is just the beginning as they bid to become the AFL\u2019s next dynasty team. Brisbane Lions (2001-03), Geelong (2007, 2009, 2011), Hawthorn (2013-15) and Richmond (2017, 2019-20) all won three flags in short succession this century, with the Magpies\u2019 challenge now to back up their memorable season. Brayden Maynard enjoys the Pies\u2019 win. Credit: Eddie Jim Maynard initially baulked when asked whether Collingwood could win back-to-back flags, but said their bulletproof culture instilled belief they could \u201cdo anything\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to lap [this premiership] up, and we\u2019re going to have some serious fun, and we might burn down Melbourne,\u201d a still-disbelieving Maynard said.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to celebrating with the team because it\u2019s taken two years of getting after it and getting better every day \u2013 we\u2019ve got better for this moment. Loading \u201cWe just want to win. We come into the club every day and get better, and we just set ourselves up, so when we come to game day, we know we\u2019ve done everything, to get the result we want.\u201d Maynard had a tumultuous start to September after his infamous collision with Melbourne\u2019s Angus Brayshaw left the Demon concussed and him defending himself at the tribunal. With a three-match ban hanging over his head, Maynard feared his dream to achieve premiership glory could be lost before he beat the charge.\nCollingwood\u2019s triumph helped banish the pain of their grand final defeat to West Coast in 2018, when Maynard was unfortunate not to receive a free kick for a block against Willie Rioli in the same passage that led to Dom Sheed\u2019s match-winning goal. \u201cEveryone knows that was a bizarre and crazy sort of week, mentally [after the Brayshaw incident],\u201d Maynard said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going well because of the what-ifs, if I missed this. That\u2019s exactly why I struggled bad that whole week. I got quite emotional after the game, giving Dad a big hug, because he\u2019s been by my side, and we did it. \u201cMy whole family \u2013 my dad, my brother [ex-Demon Corey], my mum \u2013 and everyone at this club has helped me, and this team, to get where we need to be.\u201d McRae reveals hidden message under the collar of his grand final shirt\nPeter Ryan\nCollingwood coach Craig McRae had the message \u201c44 sons\u201d written under the collar of the shirt he wore through Saturday\u2019s epic grand final to signify how he felt about each player in the Magpies squad during 2023 as they drove towards a premiership. McRae revealed the legacy theme when he spoke to players, coaches, past players, club employees, and their friends and family at Collingwood\u2019s official post-premiership celebrations held at Centrepiece in Melbourne on Saturday night. Craig McRae with Brayden Maynard. Credit: AFL Photos \/ Getty Images He said each player on the list did the same, inscribing a personal message under the collar of their own jumper with words describing the legacy they wanted to leave as a person and a player in 2023. \u201cAll the players had inside their jumper something they want to be remembered for,\u201d McRae said.\n\u201cIt was an action. It was theirs ... when we created legacy, today players ideally lived theirs. In my shirt I had [written] 44 sons. I\u2019ve got three beautiful daughters now, I don\u2019t have a son, but I consider all these guys in the squad my sons, so I wore that under my collar today.\u201d The Magpies coach said on Saturday night he was yet to return to St Vincent\u2019s Hospital where his wife Gabrielle gave birth to their daughter Maggie at 7.45am on grand final morning. Gabrielle went to the hospital with her sister at 10pm on Friday night after going into labour, before ringing McRae at 6am to join them at the hospital to be with them when the baby was born. Collingwood president Jeff Browne praised McRae and the players for their character and driving the change the club undertook when the new coach was appointed. He said the win was \u201cthe ultimate satisfaction\u201d for him, and he was rapt to be there after a health scare put him in hospital briefly on the eve of the finals.\n\u201c[It was] a bit of pit stop, a little bit of late pre-season training and got myself back into it,\u201d Browne said. Past presidents Mark Korda and Eddie McGuire, as well as previous coach and champion player Nathan Buckley, Anthony Rocca, Luke Ball and Sharrod Wellingham were among the throng celebrating the club\u2019s 16th premiership. Browne said the club wanted to recognise and acknowledge that any success was built on the efforts of those who went before them. \u201cWe are one big club. We are Collingwood ... this club has got a rich history, and days like this celebrate that history and salute the people that have gone before. We should never forget that,\u201d Browne said.\n\nThis article, authored by Peter Ryan, was published by The Sydney Morning Herald on 2023-09-30 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":220}

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size It was 16 years ago that horror filmmaker Eli Roth first introduced the world to his slasher vision Thanksgiving (tagline: \u201cThere will be no leftovers\u201d), inspired by the seasonal horror films of his \u201970s and \u201980s youth such as Halloween (1978), My Bloody Valentine (1981) and Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984). That was as a spoof movie trailer in the middle of Grindhouse, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez\u2019s pulpy 2007 double-feature, where an axe-wielding pilgrim wreaked havoc on lusty teenagers around the backwoods of Plymouth, Massachusetts. \u201c[Co-writer] Jeff Rendell and I, we grew up in Massachusetts, which is the birthplace of Thanksgiving; it\u2019s a huge deal there and in school it\u2019s really shoved down your throat \u2013 you go to these pilgrim recreation villages, there\u2019s a school play, a parade\u2026\u201d Roth explains. \u201cSo growing up we always thought, \u2018Why isn\u2019t there a Thanksgiving slasher film?\u2019 Grindhouse gave us the opportunity to try out all the kills we\u2019d already had floating around in our heads.\u201d A pilgrim-inspired killer terrorises Plymouth, Massachusetts in Thanksgiving \u2013 his name is John Carver. Over the years, the resulting trailer \u2013 campy and explicit and horrific as it was \u2013 came to be touted by genre aficionados as \u201cthe best horror movie never made\u201d. Well, until now. \u201cIt\u2019s really down to the fans, badgering me year after year,\u201d Roth jokes of how Thanksgiving came to be a real movie. \u201cGuilt-tripping and shaming me, it really works.\u201d In a metatextual flip that cheekily ribs Hollywood\u2019s predictability, this Thanksgiving is framed as a modern-day reboot of the lost slasher film that was featured in the fake movie trailer. There\u2019s a killer on the loose in modern-day Plymouth, and he\u2019s got an axe, a wrath and a creepy mask of the first US settlement\u2019s first governor. Wonderfully, his name was John Carver. \u201cI mean, when history hands you a gift like that, how do you not use it?\u201d jokes Roth. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect slasher villain name and he was real, the governor on the Mayflower!\u201d Despite Thanksgiving Day\u2019s heavy baggage (like Australia Day, many in the US have increasingly questioned the holiday\u2019s ties to colonial aggression), the film\u2019s key creative breakthrough for Roth and Rendell came from something decidedly more contemporary: watching online \u201ctrample videos\u201d from Black Friday shopping sales, traditionally held the day after Thanksgiving, that started proliferating on social media around a decade ago with news reports and clips of shoppers in a consumerist frenzy. \u201cThese Black Friday sales, they were never a thing when I was a kid. But now I know they\u2019re even in Australia, they\u2019re everywhere,\u201d says Roth, who saw fertile horror territory in the holiday\u2019s materialistic shift. \u201cThe whole idea of Thanksgiving is you\u2019re supposed to be thankful for what you have and for your health, but then you just go out and kill your neighbour for a waffle iron.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat idea gives the film its raucous opening, what might be the most horribly enjoyable 13 minutes of a film all year \u2013 a sick and clever movement that launches the film\u2019s action amid the craze of a Black Friday sale. In the great tradition of seasonal horror classics, the move lets Roth critique the gross commercialisation of the holiday, tap into our era\u2019s increasingly stoked class divisions, and evoke the horror genre\u2019s rich legacy: the hordes of rampaging shoppers rushing the shopping mall feel like a direct nod to George Romero\u2019s classic anti-capitalist screed, Dawn of the Dead (1978). Gina Gershon and Patrick Dempsey in Thanksgiving. \u201cI love Dawn of the Dead, zombies running the mall, and very much in line with Romero\u2019s views on consumerism run amok. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. There\u2019s a real darkness underneath it and it\u2019s not just people\u2019s greed that\u2019s behind [the frenzy of these] Black Friday sales,\u201d says Roth. \u201cPeople are paid shit now so there\u2019s no middle class any more so they desperately need these Black Friday sales in order to get all the Christmas gifts for their kids, otherwise they can\u2019t afford them. So then you have the very few at the top sitting in their mansions watching all the rats fighting over these crumbs, and there\u2019s something really sick about that, that everyone\u2019s been reduced to fighting for televisions and electronics because the only way they can afford them is on this one sale day, while the few at the top get richer and richer.\u201d Horror, the genre \u2013 even among films built on flimsier precepts than Thanksgiving \u2013 has a long history of reflecting the tumult and anxieties of the wider culture in which they were created. The opening scenes of crazed shoppers pressed up against the jagged glass of the mall also evokes images from the US\u2019s January 6 riots, while later scenes in which armed school students are anxiously and awkwardly forced to defend themselves against a crazed killer feel like they\u2019re engaging with the US\u2019s feverish gun control rhetoric. When I question Roth about the symbolism, he spiritually, if not literally, rolls his eyes. Director Eli Roth sees franchise potential in his remarkably fun new slasher flick. \u201cLook, I want it to be where we\u2019re in the world of the movie, we\u2019re not in the real world. I want people to escape into a rollercoaster ride and have a fun time with the movie. But certainly, if you want to write a film school thesis about it, everything\u2019s there,\u201d he says. For such a horror tragic, the first goal is always \u201cgreat kills\u201d.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEvery time I make a horror movie, it\u2019s like a badge of honour for me,\u201d says Roth. \u201cIt\u2019s like, this is my chance to make a slasher film, you know? I grew up with Freddie, Jason, Michael Myers, Chucky \u2013 I loved those movies so much \u2013 and in the \u201990s, we had Ghostface and other slashers that were overlooked, like Mute Witness (1995) which is one of my favourites. I just thought, well, it\u2019s time for a new slasher. I want a new killer in town, so let\u2019s create another one.\u201d Roth has been horror\u2019s most provocative maestro for decades now, a filmmaker who finds a sinister glee in pushing the envelope \u2013 it was his film Hostel (2005), after all, that spawned the term \u201ctorture porn\u201d. In a weak glimmer at the back of my mind, I vaguely remember attending a Q&A screening for Cabin Fever (2002), Roth\u2019s then feature debut, at Glebe\u2019s now defunct Valhalla cinema about 20 years ago. \u201cOh, I remember that,\u201d Roth recalls. \u201cI remember a kid coming up to me after, with his friend Angus, and we talked for half an hour about how much he loved the movie. And I was doing Angus\u2019 radio show the next day and that kid came up to me again and he\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, I made a short film called Saw.\u2019 It was Leigh Whannell.\u201d (L to R) Tomaso Sanelli, Nell Verlaque, Addison Rae, Gabriel Davenport and Jenna Warren, in trouble in Thanksgiving. Roth has since helmed over 20 films as a director, more than double as a producer, and also appeared onscreen \u2013 notably as Sgt. Donny \u201cThe Bear Jew\u201d Donowitz in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Inglourious Basterds (2009) and most recently in this year\u2019s comically maligned The Idol, where he played a wracked Live Nation rep. While he wasn\u2019t involved in the show\u2019s troubled first incarnation, Roth says he enjoyed his experience on creator Sam Levinson\u2019s set. \u201cYou saw this negative stuff come up [in the press] and I\u2019d be thinking, \u2018What are people talking about?\u2019\u201d he says. He completed The Idol right before he went into directing Thanksgiving, and credits the experience with \u201cswitching up my brain to use another side of my creativity\u201d. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I really am an actor\u2019s director and why actors like working with me, is that they know I understand what they go through,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the rehearsal process with the cast, or getting ready to do a scare scene, I want to give them the room to go off-script a bit until we find something interesting, and that\u2019s all from my personal experience as an actor.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article, authored by Robert Moran, was published by The Age on 2023-11-15 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":221}
{"title":"The 53 best Black Friday deals we could find at Amazon, Walmart, Target and more","context":"## The 53 best Black Friday deals we could find at Amazon, Walmart, Target and more\n\nEngadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nBlack Friday is almost here, but we wouldn't blame you if you've felt like it's been here for a while. What was once a one-day event filled with limited-time deals has grown into a month-long event with a plethora of sales to sift through each day. This year, Amazon, Target, Best Buy and Walmart and several other retailers kicked off their Black Friday deals early, with some starting as soon as late October. If you're overwhelmed by the amount of discounts showing up in your feeds, you're not alone.\n\nTo help, we at Engadget have collected all of the best Black Friday deals you can shop right now, primarily on tech we've tested and reviewed. These are the best tech deals you can get this year, on the gadgets we know to be worth your money. There's a possibility we'll see slightly lower prices on Black Friday proper \u2014 but with each passing day, that likelihood becomes less and less as even more early Black Friday deals pop up across the web. We'll be updating our list regularly in the lead-up to Black Friday, so check back to catch all of the latest Black Friday deals.\nApple iPad (9th Gen)\nApple's 9th-gen iPad is down to a new low of $230 at Amazon and Target. This is the budget pick in our iPad buying guide, and it earned a review score of 86 in 2021. It's the last iPad to use Apple's old design language, so it has thick bezels, a Lightning port, a Home button and a non-laminated display. This variant also comes with a paltry 64GB of storage. At this price, though, it's hard to do better if all you want is a large screen for streaming video, playing games and browsing the web. Its 10.2-inch display remains a step up from cheaper slates, its A13 Bionic chip is plenty fast for casual media consumption and its battery still lasts around 10 hours per charge. Most importantly, it's the cheapest route into Apple's huge app library, customer support and years of software updates. If you need more storage space, the 256GB model is also down to a low of $380.\nApple AirTags\nA four-pack of Apple\u2019s AirTags have dropped to $80, which is just about $5 more than the pack\u2019s record-low price. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, AirTags are small Bluetooth trackers that you can keep in your bag or luggage or attach to items like your keys so you can keep track of their location. The only catch is that these only work with Apple devices as their host device, so Android users will have to pick a tracker from another brand to get similar benefits. AirTags connect to Apple\u2019s Find My network, so you can see where your stuff is in that app and even force the gadgets to ring so you can more easily find your belongings (if you\u2019re within close proximity).\nApple Watch Series 9\nThe new Apple Watch Series 9 has dropped to $329 at Amazon, Walmart and Target in a Black Friday deal. That\u2019s $70 off its usual price and the lowest we\u2019ve seen since it debuted in September. That\u2019s the price you\u2019ll pay for the 41mm model, but the 45mm models are now down to $359 with the same $70 discount. The Series 9 took the crown of the best smartwatch you can get right now in our guide thanks to its new S9 SiP that brings slightly speedier performance and on-device Siri processing, the new Double Tap feature and other improvements.\nApple Watch SE\nThe Apple Watch SE has dropped to a record low of $179 for Black Friday, which is $70 off its usual price. It may not have all of the advanced health tracking features of the Series 9, but the SE has all of the basics you\u2019d want in a smartwatch, including smart notifications, all-day activity tracking and perks like Fall and Crash Detection and Emergency SOS. If you\u2019re looking for a good entry-point into the Apple Watch space, or a gift for someone who has never worn a smartwatch before, the Apple Watch SE is a great option.\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)\nThe latest version of Apple's AirPods Pro is back on sale for $190 at Amazon, Target and Best Buy. That matches an all-time low and comes in $60 below the pair's usual going rate. The AirPods Pro are the \"best for iOS\" pick in our wireless earbuds buying guide thanks to their easy pairing and deep integration with Apple devices. Effective active noise cancellation (ANC), a superb transparency mode and a pleasingly warm sound profile help as well, as does a new \"adaptive audio\" mode that can adjust the earphones' noise control settings based on your surroundings. That said, their battery life is just average at six-ish hours per charge, and you really have to use an iPhone to get anything out of them.\nWe gave the Lightning-based version of the second-generation AirPods Pro a review score of 88 last year; this new iteration is almost identical, only it comes with a USB-C charging case and has a higher IP54 dust-resistance rating. If you don't care about the updated charging port, note that the older Lightning version will be on sale for $169 at Walmart on November 22.\nApple AirPods (3rd Gen)\nThe third-gen Apple AirPods are back down to $140 at Amazon and Best Buy, matching the lowest price we've seen. Typically, the wireless earbuds have retailed between $10 and $20 higher over the past few months. We gave these AirPods a review score of 88 back in 2021: You can get better-sounding and more featured earbuds for much less, but if you're an iPhone owner who hates the feeling of traditional in-ear headphones, it might suit you well. It has a mostly balanced sound despite its unsealed design, and it gets the usual AirPods conveniences like hands-free Siri, Find My device tracking and quick pairing with other Apple gadgets. Just don't expect much in the way of deep bass or noise cancellation, as is the case with all earbuds with an \"open\" design.\nApple iPad Air\nThe iPad Air M1 is back down to a record low of $500 right now ahead of Black Friday. All color options are discounted. The Air is still the best iPad for most people at the moment, although we expect to see a fresh lineup with the latest M-series processor debut early next year. However, if you want a new iPad immediately, the Air offers speedy performance, good battery life, a slim design and Apple Pencil 2 support.\nApple iPad (10th gen)\nThe 10th-generation iPad is down to its lowest price ever at Amazon, Target and Best Buy. The 64GB model is just $349 for Black Friday in all four colors. That's $100 off and $30 less than the previous low. We gave the revamped standard iPad an 85 in our review. Compared to the 9th-gen model, the new version ditches the Home button and comes with a larger, 10.9-inch display. The front-facing camera is now on the landscape edge, which is much more convenient for video calls, though the tablet (for some reason) still only works with the first generation Apple Pencil.\nApple M2 Mac Mini\nApple's M2-powered Mac Mini desktops are also discounted for Black Friday: The 256GB model has dropped to $500 at Best Buy, while the 512GB model is on sale for $690 at Amazon with a clippable coupon. Though we expect an upgrade to the new M3 chip at some point over the next year, the current model is still a great option if you want a speedy desktop that runs macOS. It earned a score of 86 in our review, and it has a headphone jack, a Gigabit Ethernet port, two USB-A connectors, two Thunderbolt 4 USB-Cs and an HDMI 2.0 port.\nApple MacBook Pro M3\nApple released its its new M3-powered MacBook Pros just before Halloween, but the new notebooks are already on sale at Amazon, B&H and Best Buy. The entry-level 14-inch variant with the base M3 chip, 8GB of memory and 512GB of storage is $1,449, or $150 off Apple's list price. We note in our review that the M3 chip may quickly begin to push the limits of what 8GB of RAM can handle, though. If you can afford to step up to a model with more memory, note that a version with Apple's M3 Pro chip and 18GB of RAM is also $200 off at $1,799. An M3 Pro version of the larger 16-inch Pro, meanwhile, is $200 off at $2,299.\nHulu Black Friday deal\nHulu\u2019s Black Friday deal is a great one for anyone who has not subscribed to the ad-supported tier yet. You\u2019ll get one year of the service for only $12, which comes out to just $1 per month. That\u2019s 85 percent off the standard monthly price and a great deal if you\u2019ve been wanting to see what all the hype is about for shows like The Bear and Only Murders in the Building. The deal is available to new subscribers, and returning subscribers who have not been paying for Hulu for at least one month.\nDyson Airwrap\nThe coveted Dyson Airwrap is down to the cheapest price we\u2019ve ever seen, just $480 when you clip the $119 coupon on Amazon\u2019s product page. This hair tool uses the Coanda effect to keep air flowing around its barrel, helping you style your hair more easily. It also maintains a safe temperature for hair, resulting in less damage overall. You\u2019re getting a number of accessories with this Airwrap bundle as well, including two differently sized barrels, separate brushes for soft or firm smoothing, a Coanda smoothing dryer and more.\nEmber Smart Mugs\nEmber Smart Mugs are down to record-low prices for Black Friday \u2014 you can pick up a 10-ounce mug for as low as $90, or a 14-ounce cup for as low as $110. These make great gifts for anyone on your list who may be otherwise hard to shop for, provided they enjoy a hot beverage every now and then. When used with their companion app, these mugs can keep drinks at an optimal temperature for up to 80 minutes, or even longer if the cup is kept on its charging coaster.\nTP-Link Kasa Smart Plug Mini\nThe smart plug we recommend for most homes is TP-Link's Kasa Smart Plug mini. A four-pack is on sale for $35 which is about $3 more than it sold for during Amazon's October Prime day sale, :but still a decent $15 savings. Plugs like these are a simple way to add some smart capabilities to any home, letting you turn on lights with just your voice, set automated schedules and routines that are triggered by other activities. These would make a great stocking stuffer for anyone you know who's curious about smart home connectivity but hasn't yet taken the plunge.\nXbox gift card\nYou can pick up a $50 Xbox gift card for $45 right now at Amazon and Target, a digital item that would make a good gift for a gamer who\u2019s otherwise hard to shop for. This card can be used on a number of things, including game downloads, in-game purchases, membership costs like Xbox Game Pass and more. If you or a loved one is loyal to a different console, there are other digital gift cards on sale, too. A $70 PlayStation Plus gift card is going for $63 right now, while a 12-month Nintendo Switch Family plan is slightly discounted from $35 to $32.\nTP-Link Deco EX75 Wi-Fi 6E mesh router\nTP-Link\u2019s Deco EX75 mesh router system with two beacons is $100 off and down to a record low of $200. This is our top pick for a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router system, and the two-pack should cover up to 5,500 square feet with stable connectivity. When we tested the three-pack, we were impressed by how well the system balances power with user friendliness. Its network is reliable and fast, and its companion app is easy to use and clearly shows you things like all of the devices connected to your network, current speeds and more.\nXbox Series X\nThe Xbox Series X bundled with Diablo IV is down to $439 from Walmart. The console itself has a list price of $500 and the game is typically listed between $40 and $70, so this is like getting a $60 discount on the console plus a free copy of the huge action-RPG. If you're a frequent Target shopper, note that the retailer is selling this same bundle with a $75 store gift card for $450.\nXbox Series S\nA starter bundle that includes a 512GB capacity Xbox Series S and a three-month subscription to Game Pass Ultimate is currently $240 at Microsoft. The console by itself has a list price of $300 and three months of access to Xbox's service will set you back $51 after this year's price hike (though the first month is often just $1 for new members).\nAnker accessories sale\nA slew of Anker chargers, cables, power adapters and other accessories are on sale for Black Friday at Amazon, with discounts ranging up to 37 percent. The deals extend to our favorite premium power bank, Anker's Prime 20,000 mAH battery with charging base, which is $130 for the set and its lowest price ever.\nOne of the company's 67W USB-C chargers is 37 percent off, bringing it to $38 and matching its all-time low. Our top 65W fast wall charger, Anker's 735 GaNPrime, is down to a new low price after a 38 percent discount. And the Anker Nano Power Bank is seeing one of its first discounts since coming on the market a couple months ago.\nMeta Quest 2 VR headset\nThe Meta Quest 2 VR headset is $50 off and down to $249 at several retailers. That matches the best price we\u2019ve seen. At GameStop and Target, you can get the device with a $50 gift card. Despite the launch of the impressive Quest 3, we still consider the Quest 2 to be one of the best VR headsets available right now \u2014 precisely because of its more affordable price. It\u2019s still the best way to jump into VR without spending a ton of money, and the Quest 2 has the perks of being completely cordless and comfortable to wear for long sessions. The hardware includes fast-switching LCDs with a smooth 90Hz refresh rate, and it comes with Meta\u2019s sold motion controllers.\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K\nRoku's Black Friday sale knocks the price of its Streaming Stick 4K down to $30 at Amazon and its own online store. That represents a 40 percent discount. The Streaming Stick 4K is one of the best streaming devices available right now thanks to its support for all the major HDR formats, Dolby Vision and AirPlay 2, among other features. Roku\u2019s TV interface remains super user-friendly, and this dongle also supports private listening with headphones paired to your smartphone via Roku\u2019s companion app.\nSonos Black Friday sale\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar \/ Engadget Sonos Beam (Gen 2) $399 $499 Save $100 While not an all-time low, this is a rare discount on the top midrange pick in our soundbar buying guide. Several other Sonos speakers and home theater devices are also on sale. $399 at Sonos\nSonos has kicked off its Black Friday sale for the year, bringing a range of discounts on smart speakers and home theater gear. The deals include the flagship Sonos Arc soundbar down to $719, which is a $180 discount. The mid-range Sonos Beam (Gen 2) and the more basic Sonos Ray are also on sale for $399 and $223, respectively; that's a $100 drop for the former and a $56 drop for the latter. All three devices are recommendations in our guide to the best soundbars. In other home theater deals, the Sonos Sub (Gen 3) subwoofer is $160 off at $639, while the more compact Sonos Sub Mini is $86 off at $343.\nElsewhere, the Sonos Roam portable speaker is down to $134 from its usual $179, while the Sonos Roam SL \u2014 which is effectively the same device sans built-in microphones \u2014 is down to $119 from its usual $159. For a smart home speaker, the Sonos Era 100 is $50 off at $199. We highlight the Roam and Era 100 in our guide to the best smart speakers. For those looking to add Sonos functionality to existing audio gear, the Sonos Amp is now $599, a $100 discount, while the Sonos Port is now $399, a $50 discount.\nYou can read our reviews of the Arc, Beam, Ray, Roam and Era 100 for more details on what to expect from those devices. Generally speaking, we like Sonos speakers for delivering relatively clean and balanced sound and a straightforward app that lets you connect to numerous music services. Their main appeal, however, is their ability to link up with the company's other devices in one connected audio system. Deals on any Sonos gear are fairly uncommon, so this is a good chance to save if you're looking to build out your own system. Sonos says this sale will run through November 27.\nGoogle Nest Thermostat\nGoogle\u2019s Nest Thermostat is on sale for $90 right now, which is $40 off and close to a record low. It\u2019s a pared-down version of the Nest Learning Thermostat, but it has plenty of smart features and should help you save on energy costs over time. This model is Energy Star-certified and will automatically turn temperatures down in your home when you leave the house, and you can adjust heating and cooling schedules from your phone.\nGoogle Pixel 8 Pro\nGoogle\u2019s latest flagship smartphones are up to $200 off for Black Friday, including the Pixel 8 Pro, which you can snag for $799. The standard Pixel 8 is as low as $549 depending on the storage capacity you choose as well. These are the best Android phones available right now thanks to some substantial upgrades Google brought to each handset this time around. They both have upgraded Tensor G3 processors, vivid OLED displays with 120Hz refresh rates, excellent cameras and solid battery lives.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro are on sale for $115 at Wellbots. That\u2019s the best price we\u2019ve ever seen on what we consider to be the best wireless earbuds for Android users. Google learned from its previous generations of earbuds and made the best model yet with the Pros; they have improved sound quality, a comfortable design with reliable touch controls and good noise cancellation and battery life.\nGoogle Pixel Tablet\nThe Google Pixel Tablet is on sale for an all-time low of $399 at several retailers, including Amazon, Target, Best Buy and Google's own online store. That's $100 off the 11-inch slate's list price and $10 less than the deal we saw during Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days sale last month. We gave the Pixel Tablet a review score of 85 earlier this year: Its crisp LCD display, clean software and solid Tensor G2 chip make it a solid Android tablet in its own right, but its biggest selling point is the charging speaker dock that comes with it. Plop the Pixel Tablet onto that and it becomes a Nest Hub Max-style smart display and smart home hub. This deal applies to the base model with 128GB of storage, but the 256GB version is also $100 off at $499.\niRobot Roomba Combo j5+\nYou can save $300 on the Roomba Combo j5+ robot vacuum and mop at Amazon, spending $500 for the machine and its self-emptying base. The more affordable Roomba 694 is $115 off as well. The Combo machine lets you vacuum and mop with one machine and it comes with a base into which the vacuum dustbin will empty its contents after every job. The cheaper Roomba 694 is one of the best robovacs for people on a budget thanks to its slim design, strong suction power and easy-to-use mobile app.\nBreville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro\nBreville\u2019s Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro is 29 percent off and down to $320 for Black Friday. That\u2019s the best price we\u2019ve seen since the start of this year on one of our favorite air fryers. This Breville machine is much more than an air fryer, though \u2014 it has 13 cooking functions and a capacity that can handle a full turkey, so it\u2019s more like a mini convection oven that sits on your countertop. It\u2019s best for people who love to cook and have big families, or those who maybe don\u2019t have a traditional oven and want a versatile (and relatively small) appliance for their kitchen.\nFitbit Charge 6\nFitbit\u2019s newest fitness tracker, the Charge 6, is $60 off right now and down to a record low of $100. It\u2019s the follow-up to one of our favorite fitness trackers, the Fitbit Charge 5, and it brings back the physical side button that previous generations had and integrates even more with Google services. It has an AMOLED touchscreen that displays all of your activity stats and smart notifications, a built-in GPS for mapping outdoor workouts, a week-long battery life and the ability to display turn-by-turn directions on its screen from Google Maps.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick Lite\nAmazon\u2019s most affordable Fire TV Stick is down to $16 for Black Friday, which is only $1 more than its record-low price. You\u2019ll find decent discounts across most of the Fire TV lineup right now \u2014 including a $20 discount on the new Fire TV Stick 4K Max \u2014 and this model is the cheapest of the bunch. It supports HD video as well as most major streaming services, plus it comes with a pared-down version of the Alexa voice remote. If you want the most powerful dongle that Amazon makes with support for 4K HDR content and Wi-Fi 6, you\u2019ll have to spend $40 for the new Fire TV 4K Max.\nSony WH-1000XM5\nThe Sony WH-1000XM5 is down to $328 at Amazon, B&H and others. Though this isn't an all-time low, it's about $70 off Sony's list price and $20 lower than the headphones' usual recurring sale price. The XM5 is the top recommendation in our guide to the best wireless headphones, as it offers a comfortable design, powerful ANC, crisp call quality and 30 or so hours of battery life. It also comes with a number of useful bonus features such as \"Speak to Chat,\" which automatically pauses your music when you start talking to somebody else. By default, its bass-heavy sound plays well with hip-hop and EDM, though you can easily customize the EQ curve through Sony's app. We gave the XM5 a score of 95 in our review last year.\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony's WF-1000XM5, meanwhile, is the top choice in our guide to the best wireless earbuds, and it's now down to a new low of $248 at Amazon, B&H and other retailers. Several other retailers have it for $2 more. Normally, these noise-canceling earphones go for $300. Like the over-ear XM5, this in-ear model delivers excellent ANC (with strong passive isolation), loads of helpful features and a warm sound that's fun out of the box but can be customized if needed. Battery life is decent at seven or eight hours per charge and, notably, the design is lighter, smaller and altogether more comfortable than past Sony earbuds. The WF-1000XM5 earned a score of 87 in our review this past July.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra\nThe latest flagship noise-cancelling headphones from Bose, the QuietComfort Ultra is seeing a $50 discount at Amazon, Walmart and Bose direct, among others. These headphones debuted last month and retail for $429 at full price. One of our concerns in our review was that higher MSRP, so this deal takes some of the sting out of the purchase. We found this pair to offer exceptional ANC, a comfortable fit and sound quality that has more bass plus \"increased clarity and enhanced warmth\" compared to previous generations of the QC cans.\nAnker Soundcore Space A40\nThe Anker Soundcore Space A40 is down to $54 for Black Friday, matching the lowest price we\u2019ve seen. This is the top pick in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds: It\u2019s comfortable, it supports wireless charging and multi-device pairing, it can last up to 10 hours a charge and its ANC is remarkably effective for a sub-$100 pair. Its bassy sound should please most by default, but it can also be customized through a clean companion app. The only big negatives are its middling call quality and lack of wear detection.\nDyson Black Friday deals\nDyson Black Friday deals include a $200 discount on the Dyson V15 Detect Absolute, bringing the cordless vacuum down to $550. It\u2019s hard to tell if this is a record-low price, but considering the standard V15 Detect is going for between $650 and $750 across the internet, we consider this to be a good deal. In addition to its strong cleaning power, the V15 Detect has a laser-powered optic cleaner head that illuminates the floor before you as you\u2019re cleaning so you can see dust and grime more clearly. It also has a piezo sensor, which sizes and counts dust particles as you clean and shows you that information on its LCD display.\nAmazon Echo Black Friday sale\nAlmost the entirety of Amazon's Echo speaker lineup is on sale for Black Friday, with most bundled alongside a TP-Link Kasa smart bulb for no extra cost. The offers include the Echo Dot back at an all-time low of $23, the Echo Dot with Clock for $35 (a $25 discount), the standard Echo within $5 of its all-time low at $55, the larger Echo Studio for $155 and the entry-level Echo Pop back at its Prime Day price of $18.\nOf those, the Echo Dot and base Echo are likely your best bets \u2014 the former is the \"best under $50\" recommendation in our smart speaker buying guide, while the latter is our \"best under $100\" pick. The Echo Studio is still decent if you want better audio quality, though it's harder to recommend when the Sonos Era 100 is also on sale, while the Echo Pop is essentially a weaker-sounding Echo Dot for only a few bucks less. But if you're building a smart home around Alexa, each device offers similar functionality.\nAmazon Echo Show Black Friday sale\nAlong those lines, most of Amazon's Echo Show smart displays are also discounted. The recently updated Echo Show 8, for one, is on sale for a new low of $105, while the smaller 5.5-inch Echo Show 5 is back down to an all-time low of $40. Those two typically retail for $150 and $70, respectively. Again, both devices come bundled with a free LED smart bulb. You can also get an Echo Show 5 with a Ring Video Doorbell for $65.\nThe Echo Show 8 is the top Alexa pick in our guide to the best smart displays; compared to the Echo Show 5, it packs a better screen, richer speakers and a much sharper camera for video calls. But if you want something closer to a smart alarm clock for your nightstand, the smaller display still delivers most of the same Alexa smarts. If you want a larger panel, the rotating 10.1-inch Echo Show 10 is $90 off at $160 as well. We gave that one a score of 83 back in 2021, though our review found the Echo Show 8 to be a better value for most.\nGoogle Nest Hub\nIf you're partial to the Google Assistant, Google's Nest Hub is also on sale for $50 at Target and Walmart. That's $10 higher than its all-time low but still $50 off Google's list price. The Nest Hub is the top overall pick in our smart display buying guide, and we gave it a review score of 89 back in 2021. It has a 7-inch screen, so it's a bit bigger than the Echo Show 5 but should still be compact enough to fit neatly in a bedroom or small office. While it lacks a built-in camera, that may be a selling point for those who especially sensitive to their privacy (though no smart display is truly privacy-conscious).\nUltimately, whether it's worth getting a Nest Hub or Echo Show depends on what services you use: If you own a bunch of Nest devices and depend on apps like Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Photos, Google's display will make sense. If you want a larger model with a webcam and stronger speakers, the 10-inch Nest Hub Max is also on sale for $129.\nSamsung T9 SSD\nThe latest Samsung T9 portable SSD is on sale for $110 right now for a 1TB drive, which is the best price it\u2019s been since it came out last month. You can snag this Black Friday deal from Amazon or Samsung directly. The T9 is the newest iteration of Samsung\u2019s popular portable drive that we\u2019ve long been fans of, and it supports read and write speeds of up to 2,000 MB\/s. It also has dynamic thermal guard to prevent overheating, plus it comes with a USB-C to C and USB-C to A cords so you can use it with a variety of devices.\nSamsung microSD card sale\nIf you need a new microSD card for your Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck or GoPro, a trio of Samsung microSD cards we recommend are also down their lowest prices to date. The 128GB version of the Samsung Pro Plus is down to $11 at Amazon, B&H, Best Buy and others, while the 256GB and 512GB models are down to $18 and $32, respectively. Beyond that, the 256GB Samsung Evo Select is on sale for a new low of $15 and the 256GB Samsung Pro Ultimate is available for $25.\nThe Pro Plus is the top overall pick in our microSD card buying guide, as it consistently ranked among the fastest cards we tested despite its relatively affordable price tag. The Pro Ultimate offers faster read speeds, so it could be worth the step up if you often move files between your card and a computer. The Evo Select is our \"best value\" pick: It's slower than the other two, but it's cheaper, and its losses won't be hugely noticeable in devices that can't take advantage of the extra performance such as the Switch. Each card comes with a 10-year warranty.\nPlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller\nAmazon, Walmart, PlayStation Direct and several other retailers have discounted a bunch of PlayStation DualSense controllers ahead of Black Friday, including many of the colorways that typically go for $75. You can pick up Cosmic Red, Starlight Blue, Nova Pink and other models for $50 each, which is just about a record-low price. These controllers work with the PS5 as well as PC, and they sport adaptive L2 and R2 triggers, haptic feedback and a built-in mic array.\nXbox Wireless Controller\nIf you need a spare gamepad for your Xbox, meanwhile, official Xbox Series X\/S Wireless Controllers are as low as $40 at Microsoft and Best Buy. As with the DualSense deal above, this discount applies to various colors. Typically, we see the gamepad retail between $50 and $60 depending on the colorway. The Series X\/S controller doesn't have the DualSense's advanced haptics and requires AA batteries for power by default \u2014 we recommend grabbing a rechargeable set \u2014 but some will always find its shape and asymmetrical joysticks more comfortable. It's also simpler to set up and use on PC.\nPS5 + Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 bundle\nIf you or someone you love hasn\u2019t gotten their hands on a PS5 yet, a new Black Friday bundle pairs the $500 console with the new (and critically acclaimed) Spider-Man 2 game for no extra cost. The PS5 remains one of the best gaming consoles you can get right now, and we found the open-world game to be even better than its predecessor in our review. In it, you can swap between playing as Peter Parker and Miles Morales, and it includes expanded combat mechanics.\nPS5 Slim + Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III bundle\nYou can get Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for free with this $499 PS5 Slim bundle that\u2019s roughly $60 off the price of buying each separately and available at multiple retailers. Sony announced this new svelte version of its console last month and it\u2019s been popping up sporadically across the internet since then. Depending on the model you choose, it\u2019ll be up to 24 percent lighter than the standard PS5 and it will take up about 30 percent less space overall.\nNintendo Switch OLED + Super Smash Bros. Ultimate bundle\nThe main Nintendo Switch deal for Black Friday bundles the $350 Nintendo Switch OLED with a digital copy of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and a three-month individual subscription to Nintendo Switch Online for no extra cost. This offer is available at Walmart, Target, GameStop, Best Buy and Nintendo's own online store. Smash Bros. Ultimate was released way back in 2018, so it's hard to call this an amazing deal, but the game remains one of the console's best and still typically retails between $50 and $60 on its own. The Switch Online sub, meanwhile, goes for $8. If you're late to the Switch bandwagon, you could do much worse for a free pack-in game \u2014 but keep in mind that Nintendo is expected to unveil its next console at some point in 2024.\nBackbone One\nPhoto by Mat Smith \/ Engadget Backbone One $70 $100 Save $30 Both the USB-C and Lightning versions of this recommended mobile game controller are 30 percent off for Black Friday. For the former, that's an all-time low. $70 at Amazon\nThe Backbone One mobile game controller is down to $70 at Amazon, Target, Backbone's online store and other retailers. That's a $30 discount. Both the USB-C and Lightning models are on sale; the latter is compatible with Apple's iPhone 15 series as well as numerous Android phones. We gave the Backbone a positive review last year, and we recommend it in our guide to the best gaming handhelds: It's more cramped than a traditional gamepad, naturally, but it has all the requisite buttons to play modern games, it's extremely easy to set up and it works well for remote streaming from your console or PC. If nothing else, it's a much better value than the PlayStation Portal.\nPlayStation, Xbox and Switch video game sales\nIf you're all set on the hardware front, a truckload of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X\/S and Nintendo Switch games have dropped in price for Black Friday too. Both Sony and Microsoft have rolled out holiday sales on their respective digital storefronts, while a number of physical games are down to new lows at Amazon, Best Buy and others.\nThere are frankly too many deals for us to list them all here, but some highlights for PlayStation and Xbox owners include Assassin's Creed Mirage and the dramatic action-RPG Final Fantasy XVI for $40 each, God of War Ragnar\u00f6k for $35, Gran Turismo 7 for $30, the rhythm action game Hi-Fi Rush for $22, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Horizon Forbidden West for $20 each and Halo: The Master Chief Collection for $10. Many of those make our lists of the best PS5 games and best Xbox games.\nOn the Switch side, the turn-based strategy game Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope is on sale for $15, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and Luigi's Mansion 3 are each down to $40 and the excellent 2D platformer Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is down to a new low of $30. There are plenty more games on sale beyond those, and we expect to see more PC game deals over the course of the week.\nDJI Osmo Action 3 Creator Combo\nAs part of a larger sale on DJI cameras and accessories, the DJI Osmo Action 3 is seeing a discount as part of a bundle that includes two batteries, a 32GB microSD card and a case. Separately and not on sale, the set would run you $379, but is now down to $319. This isn't the newest version of DJI's GoPro Alternative camera, that one, the Osmo Action 4 isn't on sale. The newer version has a larger sensor and improved dynamic range, but at a higher price. But if you don't plan on shooting a lot of low-light footage, you may be happy with the performance of the Action 3. We put it through its paces in our review and liked the excellent video quality, and found it to be on par with GoPro's Hero 10. The the magnetic clip mount and long-lasting, fast-charging battery are also reasons to buy.\nMasterclass Black Friday deal\nMasterclass\u2019 Black Friday deal gives you two memberships for the price of one, starting at $120 per year. That provides two individual memberships, while you can pay a total of $180 for access for two devices simultaneously, content downloads and a Family membership that covers six devices. Masterclass could be a good gift option for people who love to learn or collect hobbies as it provides access to hundreds of hours of video of masters of their craft explaining how they do their work. Some classes have exercises you can complete as well, making it feel more like a real class. This deal will be available until the end of the day on Black Friday proper.\nHeadspace Black Friday deal\nHeadspace Headspace $35 $70 Save $35 Headspace has knocked 50 percent off its memberships for Black Friday, so you can pay only $35 to get one year of access. $35 at Headspace\nHeadspace\u2019s Black Friday deal is back for 2023, knocking half off subscriptions for new and returning subscribers. You\u2019ll spend $35 if you pay for one year upfront, or $6.50 per month if you choose the more frequent payment method. Headspace is a solid meditation and mindfulness app that packs a lot of value, including dozens of guided meditation sessions to choose from at various durations, \u201csleepcasts\u201d and soothing audio to help you get better shut eye and curated yoga and fitness videos that can help you stick to your physical health goals.\nSurfshark VPN\nSurfshark\u2019s Black Friday deal knocks up to 86 percent off two-year plans, and you\u2019ll get a few extra months of service for free depending on the plan you select. We consider Surfshark to be one of the best VPN services available right now, particularly if you want a solid VPN at an affordable price. We believe the mid-tier plan, Surfshark One, will be the best for most people and a two-year plan is down to $2.69 per month, with an additional four months of services thrown in for free.\nSamsung M80C Smart Monitor\nSamsung\u2019s Smart Monitor M80C is $300 off and down to $400 right now. The selling point for this display, and really any Samsung Smart Monitor, is that it pulls triple duty as an external display, a smart TV and an IoT hub. In addition to connecting it to your computer, you can use it standalone as a TV thanks to the built-in TV operating system and included remote, and the embedded SmartThings hub lets you directly connect things like smart lights and other gear to the display.\nMotorola razr+\nThe Moto razr+ is 30 percent off and down to a record low of $700. It earned a spot in our best foldable phones guides thanks to handy exterior display that\u2019s actually easier to use than that on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 and its ability to fold in half and get super compact and pocket-friendly. It\u2019s cameras are not on par with those on Samsung\u2019s foldables, but it\u2019s a generally solid flip phone with a ton of personality\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds II\nThe Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II are down to $199, which is the same as they went for for October Prime Day. During that sale you needed to be a Prime member to save, but now anyone can take advantage of the discount. They retail for $299, but have sold for $279 for the past few months, so this is still an $80 discount. We think they're best wireless earbuds you can buy for noise cancelation, as they do a great job of blocking out the world. They also have a smaller, more comfortable fit than the previous generation and offer good audio quality.\nSamsung The Frame QLED TV\nThe 55-inch Samsung The Frame smart TV is 35 percent off and down to a new record low of $978 at Amazon. Samsung itself has it for a couple bucks more. Other size options are also discounted. The Frame has been super popular thanks to its design, which mimics framed artwork when not in use. It has a matte, anti-reflective display and an included slim wall mount so you can get the true \u201cartwork\u201d effect when you hang it on the wall. As an actual TV, it supports 4K content and Quantum Dot technology, plus it runs on Samsung\u2019s Tizen TV operating system.\nSolo Stove Black Friday deal\nSolo Stove\u2019s Black Friday deals have knocked up to $245 off fire pit bundles, up to $100 off fire pits by themselves and even more. A standout is the Ranger Backyard Bundle 2, which is $145 off and down to $320. It includes the company\u2019s most compact fire pit along with its accompanying shield, stand, lid and shelter. Everything you\u2019d need for an easy setup right out of the box is included in this bundle, and the 2.0-version of the Ranger includes a removable base plate and ash pan, both of which make the fire pit much easier to clean.\nProtonVPN Black Friday deal\nOur favorite VPN service, ProtonVPN, is having a rare sale for Black Friday that brings a monthly subscription down to only $4 for a total of 30 months. That means you\u2019ll pay $120 for two and a half years of access, which is a pretty good deal. ProtonVPN passed our tests with high marks, but what made it stand out among other VPN security services was its independently audited no-logs policy, and the fact that the company has proven they don't comply with law enforcement requests to reveal data. If you want to jump in head-first with Proton services, the company has discounted Proton Unlimited, which includes access to VPN, Mail, Calendar, Drive and Pass, to just under $9 per month for the first year.\nLG A2 OLED TV\nWe expect to see many more TV deals as we get closer to Black Friday, but for now one standout is LG's 48-inch A2 OLED TV on sale for a new low of $550 at Best Buy. This is an entry-level model from 2022, so it's limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, lacks HDMI 2.1 ports and doesn't support other gaming-friendly features like VRR. That said, it's still an OLED TV, so it delivers deep contrast, bold colors, wide viewing angles and low input lag. At this price, it should be a nice step-up option for smaller or secondary rooms. Just note that it can't get as bright as higher-end OLED sets, so it's best situated away from direct sunlight.\nMicrosoft Surface Pro 9\nA configuration of Microsoft's Surface Pro 9 with an Intel Core i5-1235U processor, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and Microsoft's Surface Pro Keyboard is on sale for $1,000 at Best Buy. That's $540 off Microsoft's list price. If you don't need the keyboard, a variant with a faster Core i7-1255U chip is down to a new low of $1,097 at Amazon, Microsoft, B&H and other retailers. That's roughly $200 off the config's usual street price. Another Core i7 model with 512GB of storage is on sale for $300 more.\nIn any event, the Surface Pro 9 tops our guide to the best 2-in-1 tablets. While its 12th-gen chip is about to be two generations old, this is still the device to get if you want the functionality of a laptop in the slim, touch-enabled design of a tablet. We're past the point of the year when Microsoft would normally announce a refresh, but the current model should still be useful if you're coming from an older Surface Pro that's in desperate need of an upgrade.\nLenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook Plus\nLenovo's IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook Plus is on sale for $379 at Best Buy, which is $120 off its list price. This is the most recent version of the top pick in our Chromebook buying guide: Its 14-inch, 1,920 x 1,200 IPS touchscreen is good for the money, it's plenty fast for the kind of web browsing and light work you'd do with Chrome OS and both its keyboard and trackpad are comfortable. This model comes with a Core i3-1315U processor, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of eMMC storage, one USB-A port, two USB-C 3.2 ports and a microSD card slot. It also has a decent 1080p webcam. The chassis isn't especially light at 3.6 pounds, and we found the battery to last roughly seven hours in testing, which is just OK. But for less than $400, this is a strong value for those who just want an affordable notebook for the basics.\nFAQs\nWhen is Black Friday 2023?\nBlack Friday 2023 lands on November 24 this year, with Cyber Monday 2023 following up a few days later on November 27. However, the early deals have already begun. The entire month of November might as well be renamed Holiday Shopping Month as that\u2019s when companies really start to get serious with their discounts.\nWhat day is Black Friday 2023 at Walmart?\nWalmart Black Friday deals will begin early this year on November 8. Walmart+ members will get a few hours of early access to Black Friday deals if they shop online on November 8, with access for everyone else starting later that day. Walmart will match its online Black Friday deals in stores starting November 10.\nWill Amazon have a Black Friday sale in 2023?\nAmazon will likely have a Black Friday sale in 2023. While the online retailer hasn\u2019t made its deals known yet like Walmart has, Amazon will almost certainly have deals across all of the types of products it sells, including electronics. We anticipate seeing record-low prices on Amazon devices in particular, like Echo speakers, Fire TVs, Kindles and more. In years past, Amazon Black Friday deals have brought some of the best prices of the year on our favorite gadgets and gear, including headphones, tablets, smartwatches, robot vacuums and more.\nWhat other retailers have Black Friday sales in 2023?\nMost retailers have Black Friday sales, so you can expect to see Target, Best Buy, and others join Walmart and Amazon in discounting inventory to capitalize on holiday shopping interest. In the consumer electronics space, we expect most companies to have some sort of Black Friday promotion, so that means you will likely be able to get big-ticket items from brands like Apple, Samsung, Google, Sony, LG, Sonos and others for much cheaper prices.\nYour Black Friday Shopping Guide: See all of Yahoo\u2019s Black Friday coverage, here.

{"title":"Republicans dump Jim Jordan as House Speaker nominee, leaving Congress in crisis yet again","context":"## Republicans dump Jim Jordan as House Speaker nominee, leaving Congress in crisis yet again\n\nRepublicans dropped Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday as their nominee for House speaker, making the decision during a closed-door session after the hard-edged ally of Donald Trump failed badly on a third ballot for the gavel.\nAfterward, Jordan said simply of his colleagues, \u201cWe put the question to them, they made a different decision.\u201d\nThe hard-charging Judiciary Committee chairman said House Republicans now need to come together and \u201cfigure out who our speaker is going to be.\u201d\nThe House impasse deepening into a full-blown crisis, Republicans have no realistic or workable plan to unite the fractured GOP majority, elect a new speaker and return to the work of Congress that has been languishing since hard-liners ousted Kevin McCarthy at the start of the month.\nMajority Leader Steve Scalise said they\u2019re going \u201ccome back and start over\u201d on Monday.\nAngry, frustrated Republicans who have been watching their majority control descend into chaos left the private session blaming one another for the divisions they have created. Next steps are highly uncertain as lawmakers start offering new ideas for a possible speaker. But it appears no one at present can win a GOP majority.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very bad place right now,\u201d McCarthy said earlier.\nIn a floor vote Friday morning, Jordan\u2019s third reach for the gavel, he lost 25 Republican colleagues, worse than he had fared earlier in the week, and far from the majority needed, as they reject his hardline approach.\nBut after two failed votes, Jordan\u2019s third attempt at the gavel essentially collapsed \u2014 in large part because more centrist Republicans are revolting over the nominee and the hardball tactics being used to win their votes. They have been bombarded with harassing phone calls and even reported death threats.\nAhead of the vote, Jordan showed no signs of stepping aside, insisting at a Capitol press conference: \u201cThe American people are hungry for change.\u201d\nBut afterward Jordan told colleagues behind closed doors, \u201cI tried my best,\u201d according to one of his opponents, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.\nFor more than two weeks the stalemate has shut down the U.S. House, leaving a seat of American democracy severely hobbled at a time of challenges at home and abroad. The House Republican majority appears to have no idea how to end the political turmoil and get back to work.\nWith Republicans in majority control of the House, 221-212, any candidate can lose only a few detractors. It appears there is no Republican at present who can win a clear majority, 217 votes, to become speaker.\nIn fact, the hard-charging Judiciary chairman lost rather than gained votes despite hours spent trying to win over holdouts, no improvement from the 20 and then 22 Republicans he lost in early rounds this week.\nFriday\u2019s vote was 194 for Jordan, his lowest tally yet, and 210 for Jeffries, with two absences on each side.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the votes to be speaker,\u201d Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., said after a late Thursday meeting when Jordan sought to hear detractors out and shore up support.\nThe holdouts want \u201cnothing\u201d from Jordan, Gimenez said, adding that some of the lawmakers in the meeting simply called on Jordan to drop out of the race.\nOne extraordinary idea, to give the interim speaker pro tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry, more powers for the next several months to at least bring the House back into session and conduct crucial business, was swiftly rejected by Jordan\u2019s own ultra-conservative allies.\nA \u201cbetrayal,\u201d said Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind.\nNext steps were highly uncertain as angry, frustrated Republicans predict the House could essentially stay closed for the foreseeable future \u2014 perhaps until the mid-November deadline for Congress to approve funding or risk a federal government shutdown.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out if there\u2019s a way we can get back with a Republican-only solution,\u201d said veteran legislator Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what normal majorities do. What this majority has done is prove it\u2019s not a normal majority.\u201d\nWhat was clear was that Jordan was refusing to step aside, appearing determined to wait out his foes even as his path to become House speaker was all but collapsing.\nMany view Jordan, a founding member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, as too extreme for a central seat of U.S. power, second in line to the presidency.\n\u201cOne thing I cannot stomach or support is a bully,\u201d said a statement from Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who voted against Jordan on the second ballot and said she received \u201ccredible death threats.\u201d\nDemocratic Leader Jeffries reiterated that his party was \u201cready, willing and able\u201d to partner with more traditional Republicans on a path to re-open the House \u2014- particularly as Congress is being asked to consider President Joe Biden\u2019s aid package for Israel, Ukraine and other needs.\nA closed-door meeting Thursday to regroup grew heated at times with Republican factions blaming one another for sending their majority into chaos, lawmakers said.\nElevating McHenry to an expanded speaker\u2019s role could be a possible off-ramp for the crisis, but it would not be as politically simple as it might seem.\nRepublicans are loath to partner with the Democrats in a bipartisan way on the arrangement, and it\u2019s highly unlikely Republicans could agree to give McHenry more powers on their own, since their hard-liners don\u2019t like it.\nMcHenry himself has brushed off attempts to take the job more permanently after he was appointed to the role after the unprecedented ouster of McCarthy more than two weeks ago.\nTo win over GOP colleagues, Jordan had relied on backing from Trump, the party\u2019s front-runner in the 2024 election, and groups pressuring rank-and-file lawmakers for the vote. But they were not enough and in fact backfired on some.\nJordan has been a top Trump ally, particularly during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack by the former president\u2019s backers who were trying to overturn the 2020 election he lost to Biden. Days later, Trump awarded Jordan a Medal of Freedom.\nFirst elected in 2006, Jordan has few bills to his name from his time in office. He also faces questions about his past.\nSome years ago, Jordan denied allegations from former wrestlers during his time as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University who accused him of knowing about claims they were inappropriately groped by an Ohio State doctor. Jordan has said he was never aware of any abuse.\n\nThis article, authored by Lisa Mascaro, Farnoush Amiri, Stephen Groves, Kevin Freking, The Associated Press, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-20 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":223}
{"title":"Michigan conquers Ohio State again, but the story is far from over for 2023 Wolverines","context":"## Michigan conquers Ohio State again, but the story is far from over for 2023 Wolverines\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2013 Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy heard Zak Zinter scream. McCarthy saw tackle Karsen Barnhart holding Zinter's foot in the air. This was a gruesome scene at Michigan Stadium on Saturday.\nNo. 3 Michigan lost their senior All-American guard to a broken tibia and fibula with 2:19 left in the third quarter of a tie game with No. 2 Ohio State. Zinter was carted off in what could have been a turning point in the other direction given his value on the interior line.\n\"It was a sight that I wouldn't wish upon anyone to see,\" McCarthy said. \"At that moment, seeing the look in everyone's eyes, seeing them rally together, it was spiritual, honestly. It was a different drive that hit on everybody.\"\nOn the next play, senior running back Blake Corum finally broke through the second level of the Buckeyes' defense for a 22-yard go-ahead touchdown. Corum flashed Zinter's number \"65\" with his hands. From there, the Wolverines handled business for a third straight year in The Game in a 30-24 victory.\nMORE: Corum gives tribute to teammate after key touchdown\nMichigan tops Ohio State again\nMichigan (12-0) beat Ohio State (11-1) for the third straight season. Corum, who missed last year's 45-23 victory against the Buckeyes because of a knee injury, could feel Zinter's pain.\n\"Zak's my guy,\" Corum said. \"He's another guy that came back for unfinished business. That's why he came back. Seeing him go down and hurt, it was very emotional seeing what he was going through. We came together, and we knew we had to do it for him. The very next play, 'Boom.'\"\nBoom, indeed. This Michigan story is far from over.\nIt will continue at least into the Big Ten championship game against No. 17 Iowa. You know that off-the-field story by now. That is the one where this team continues to overcome obstacles \u2013 self-inflicted and otherwise. The on-field story is a withering march through the Big Ten toward a third straight College Football Playoff berth.\nIt could have ended with Ohio State. Jim Harbaugh's three-game suspension from the Big Ten as a result of the illegal in-person scouting and sign-stealing operation dominated headlines more than the Wolverines dominated opponents in the second half of the season. Ohio State had not lost three in a row to Michigan since 1995-97.\nThe Buckeyes were due, right?\nMichigan acting coach Sherrone Moore had other plans. He beat Ohio State coach Ryan Day. Cornerback Will Johnson set the tone by intercepting Ohio State quarterback Kyle McCord with 7:32 left in the first quarter. That set the Wolverines up at the 7-yard line.

That makes the hairs on my arm stick up.\"\nCorum scored on a one-yard touchdown for a 7-0 lead. Michigan never played from behind against the Buckeyes. What was Moore thinking in that situation?\n\"Let's go,\" Moore said. \"That's it. The players just practiced so well this week, and when you have confidence they are going to execute at a high level, it's just like first down.\"\nMoore favored a conservative game plan the previous two weeks against No. 11 Penn State and Maryland; one that amounted to 91 running plays and 31 pass attempts. Yet he was the aggressor in The Game. The Wolverines converted three fourth-down conversions in the first half. McCarthy \u2013 who finished 16 of 20 for 148 yards and a TD \u2013 threw a 22-yard touchdown to Roman Wilson between two defenders for a 14-3 lead.\nInterim coach Sherrone Moore leads Michigan to win\n\u200b\u200b\"Coach Moore said from the get-go that he was going to the most-aggressive game he's ever called,\" McCarthy said. \"For the big boys, for Blake, for myself, that's music to our ears that he has the confidence in us to go get the extra yard or two yards. That's who we are.\"\nMichigan played to win the game. Ohio State, not so much. The Buckeyes settled for a 52-yard field goal late in the first half, which Jayden Fielding missed wide left.\nEven when Ohio State tied the score at 17-17 with 6:08 left in the third quarter on an up-tempo drive that featured eight straight run plays and a TreVeyon Henderson touchdown, Michigan answered. The Wolverines scored on every drive in the second half \u2013 three field goals and a touchdown.\n\"It goes back to how they prepare, how they attack things and how they work,\" Moore said. \"I would be doing them a disservice if I went out there and was conservative.\"\nSay what you will about the adults who were involved in the in-person scouting scandal. Staffer Conor Stallions and assistant coach Chris Partridge are gone. Harbaugh was suspended. He addressed the team Friday, and McCarthy listened closely.\n\"The one thing he said that stuck out, the whole mantra, 'The Team, The Team, The Team,'\" McCarthy said. \"He said we are that team.\"\nThat is true. This is the most mature player-led Michigan football team on the field since 1997 \u2013 when the program beat Ohio State 20-14 in a top-five showdown and split the national championship with Nebraska.\nSince then, the Buckeyes found a way in these high-magnitude games, with 2006 and 2016 the best examples. On a stage that was somewhere in between those classics, the Wolverines pointed the pressure in the other direction. Marvin Harrison Jr. had five catches for 118 yards and a TD, but Michigan ran seven minutes off the clock after that with a field goal. That will be the other point of criticism for Day and defensive coordinator Jim Knowles.\nMORE: Will Texas A&M pursue Ryan Day?\nOhio State had one minute to score in the end, but Michigan safety Rod Moore, a Clayton, Ohio, product, came up with the game-sealing interception in yet another recurring theme from the 1990s.\nThe Wolverines aren't just winning this game now. They expect to win this game. Just like last year, McCarthy and Corum took turns repeating the famous Kobe Bryant mantra in the post-game press conference.\n\"The job is not finished,\" McCarthy said. \"We've been here before.\"\n\"We've been going through things all year, so we know how to stick together and play for each other and always have our brother's back,\" Corum said.\nThey have, and the last two years ended with victories in the Big Ten championship game before losses to Georgia and TCU in the CFP semifinals. The NCAA investigation will continue, but if Saturday proved anything, the Wolverines will play out the rest of the season on their terms.\nThis Michigan story is far from over, and Harbaugh returns Monday.\nBoom, indeed.\n\nThis article, authored by Bill Bender, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-25 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":224}

{"title":"Sex, Signal messages, and sabotaging FTX's code: SBF execs and Bahamas roommates tell all in court","context":"## Sex, Signal messages, and sabotaging FTX's code: SBF execs and Bahamas roommates tell all in court\n\nWitness Adam Yedidia answers questions during Sam Bankman-Fried fraud trial over the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, at Federal Court in New York City, October 5, 2023, in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\nTwo of Sam Bankman-Fried's former friends from MIT, who also worked at crypto exchange FTX while living with the company's founder in the Bahamas, took the stand in a Manhattan courtroom this week to testify against their former classmate, confidant, and boss \u2014 a man who allegedly ran a crypto empire that defrauded thousands of customers out of billions of dollars. Gary Wang, the lesser-known co-founder of FTX, was asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos on Thursday, \"Did you commit financial crimes while working at FTX?\" \"Yes,\" responded Wang. He said that his crimes, including wire and commodities fraud, were carried out with the help of Bankman-Fried, FTX ex-engineering head Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison, who ran sister hedge fund Alameda Research and had been Bankman-Fried's girlfriend. \"Mr. Wang, do you see any of the people you committed those crimes with in the courtroom today?\" Roos continued. Wang, dressed in an oversized and wrinkled suit with a red tie and glasses, awkwardly stood up and looked around the courtroom before responding, \"Yes.\" \"Who do you see?\" asked Roos. \"Sam Bankman-Fried,\" he said. The trial, set to last six weeks, will resume on Tuesday with key testimony expected from Ellison, who is considered the prosecution's star witness, having already pleaded guilty to multiple charges. Bankman-Fried faces seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, that could put him in prison for the rest of his life. Thus far, Bankman-Fried, 31, has remained mostly quiet in court intently listening to witnesses and at times writing notes to his attorneys. But as Wang testified against him, Bankman-Fried looked visibly upset, shifting his gaze from his former friend to the ground, and at one point putting his head in his hands.\nSam Bankman-Fried listens as Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos questions Gary Wang during Bankman-Fried's fraud trial over the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, at Federal Court in New York City, U.S., October 6, 2023, in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\nWang, 30, was technology chief for FTX, which spiraled into bankruptcy in November. He spoke so fast that U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan and the prosecutor both stopped him at points to ask that he slow his pace. Much of Wang's testimony on Friday focused on the final days at FTX before the entire operation imploded, including reports in the media detailing Alameda's business practices and its troubling ties to FTX. Wang said that in response to the reporting an emergency meeting was called between Bankman-Fried, Wang and Singh, to discuss shutting down Alameda. He said they ultimately decided against such a move, because he and Bankman-Fried were aware that Alameda had no way to repay the roughly $14 billion hole in its books. Prosecutors took the jury through a series of tweets, beginning on Nov. 7. Posts came from the company blaming bank hours for slow withdrawals, while Bankman-Fried tweeted from his personal account, assuring customers that all was fine. \"FTX was not fine and assets were not fine,\" Wang testified. On Nov. 12, after FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried asked Wang to drive with him to the Bahamas Securities Commission for a meeting. On the drive, Bankman-Fried told Wang to transfer assets to Bahamian liquidators because he believed they would allow him to maintain control of the company. Wang said he wasn't in the meeting with the securities authority, though Bankman-Fried's dad was present.\n\nWang said he returned to the U.S. and met with prosecutors the next day. He faces up to 50 years in prison when he faces a judge for sentencing following this trial. He told jurors he signed a six-page cooperation agreement that requires him to meet with prosecutors, answer their questions truthfully and turn over evidence.\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is seen during a hearing as a U.S judge revoked his bail, at a courthouse in New York, U.S., August 11, 2023 in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\n$65 billion line of credit\nFor months, Bankman-Fried has known that Wang and Ellison, who were integral members of his personal and professional inner circles, had turned on him. Both pleaded guilty in December and have since been cooperating with the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. Wang's testimony, which stretched into Friday, was given under a cooperation agreement with the government. Ellison is expected to take the stand under a similar arrangement.\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan presides as Gary Wang testifies during the fraud trial of Sam Bankman-Fried over the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, at Federal Court in New York City, U.S., October 6, 2023 in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\nBorn in China, Wang moved to the U.S. at age 7, and grew up in Minnesota before going to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study math and computer science. He worked at Google after college. Wang, who first met Bankman-Fried during high school at a summer camp, owned 10% of Alameda, while his boss owned the other 90%. Wang told the court about the advantages that Alameda received by having code baked into FTX's software that allowed special access to the crypto exchange. Those privileges ultimately resulted in Alameda owing FTX $8 billion worth of customer deposits. \"We gave special privileges on FTX that gave unlimited withdrawals on the platform to Alameda,\" Wang said. Alameda was allowed to withdraw and transfer those funds and had a $65 billion line of credit. \"When customers deposited USD, it went to Alameda,\" he said. \"It existed in the computer code. Alameda could have negative balances and unlimited withdrawals.\" That \"bug\" in the code was written by Nishad Singh, who was FTX's director of engineering, and reviewed by Wang. Bankman-Fried was calling the shots, Wang said. Wang also told the court about a $1 million personal loan he received and a $200 million to $300 million loan in his name from Alameda that was never deposited into his account, but rather was used to make investments into other companies on behalf of FTX. That was all done by Bankman-Fried, he testified. In early 2020, Wang said he discovered for the first time Alameda's negative balance exceeded FTX's revenue, an indication that Alameda was taking customer funds. Wang said he brought this to Bankman-Fried's attention several times. In late 2021, Wang discovered Alameda had withdrawn $3 billion from its $65 billion line of credit. Wang's compensation was a base salary of $200,000 per year plus stock. He owned roughly 17% of FTX. Even though they were co-founders, \"ultimately it was Sam's decision to make\" when there were disagreements, he said.\nAssistant United States Attorney Nicolas Roos questions Gary Wang during Sam Bankman-Fried's fraud trial over the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, at Federal Court in New York City, U.S., October 6, 2023, in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\nAn $8 billion bug\nAdam Yedidia, who was the prosecution's second witness on Wednesday, continued his testimony on Thursday. Yedidia met Bankman-Fried in college at MIT, and the pair remained close friends. Yedidia, assuming a robotic posture on the stand, worked out of FTX's Hong Kong office from January to October of 2021 and then in the Bahamas until last year's collapse. In his testimony, he referred to a group Signal thread called \"People of the House,\" referring to Bankman-Fried's $35 million penthouse, where many employees lived.\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Exhibit from the prosecution shows Signal thread called \"People of the House,\" referring to Bankman-Fried's $35 million penthouse, where many employees lived. Source: SDNY\nIn terms of who was paying the rent, Yedidia recalled Bankman-Fried saying he \"assumed it's just Alameda paying for it in the end.\" Yedidia said Bankman-Fried had told him, before he began working in the Bahamas in 2019, that he and Ellison had sex. Bankman-Fried asked Yedidia if it was a good idea for them to date, to which Yedidia said no. Bankman-Fried responded by saying he was expecting that answer. One of Yedidia's responsibilities was fixing the bug in the code that gave Alameda preferential treatment. In June 2022, he submitted a report to Bankman-Fried on Signal that showed $8 billion in customer money held in an internal database tracking the cash wired to an Alameda account called \"fiat at ftx.com\" was missing. Yedidia said he and Bankman-Fried spoke about it at the pickleball court at the resort in Nassau, Bahamas. He asked his boss if things were OK. He was concerned because it \"seemed like a lot of money\" from FTX customers was at risk. \"Sam said, we were bulletproof last year. We aren't bulletproof this year,\" Yedidia testified. Yedidia said he asked when they would be bulletproof again. Bankman-Fried said he wasn't sure, but it may be six months to three years. Yedidia said Bankman-Fried appeared \"worried or nervous,\" which he said was atypical. Still, Yedidia said he trusted Bankman-Fried and Ellison to \"handle the situation.\" On cross-examination, Christian Everdell, Bankman-Fried's attorney, focused on how Yedidia was the one responsible for developing and reviewing the code.\n\nHe asked about the long hours employees worked and Yedidia's concern for Wang being near burnout. That resulted in Yedidia instituting a rule to not wake Wang at night for bug fixes because he needed sleep. Everdell also drilled Yedidia on his high level of compensation in his less than two years at FTX. His base salary was between $175,000 and $200,000, but he received multiple bonuses of more than $12 million in cash and company equity. Yedidia said he's now teaching math \u2014 geometry and algebra \u2014 at a high school. He invested most of the millions he earned as bonuses back into FTX, and his equity stake is now worthless. As FTX was failing, Yedidia said he was by Bankman-Fried's side. He highlighted a Signal exchange in November 2022, during which he wrote, \"I love you Sam. I'm not going anywhere.\" He said he wrote the message because so many people had left. When asked what changed, Yedidia said he learned that FTX customer deposits had been used to pay loans to creditors. He said Alameda's actions seemed \"flagrantly wrong.\" Yedidia's testimony ended on a fiery note, which was later struck from the record. He was asked why he had lost faith in FTX and resigned. \"FTX defrauded all its customers,\" he said.\nMatt Huang, co-founder of Paradigm Operations LP, right, arrives at court in New York, US, on Thursday, Oct. 5, 2023.

That stake was wiped out. Huang testified about his firm's due diligence on FTX, and he told the court that Bankman-Fried assured him that funds would be used for FTX and not Alameda. Additionally, he was promised that Alameda had no preferential treatment on the FTX platform, even though the hedge fund was one of its top traders. Huang said he was concerned about FTX's lack of a board of directors, but he eventually invested anyway. During cross-examination, Huang said Paradigm pressed Bankman-Fried on the board issue and was told he didn't want investors as directors but he did plan on having a board with experts. \u2014 CNBC's Dawn Giel contributed to this report.\n\nThis article was published by Cnbc | World Business News Leader on 2023-10-06 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":226}

The comedian's episode marked the premiere of the show's second season.\nWilliams began his career in stand-up comedy in the 1970s and elevated his fame after appearing in an episode of \"Happy Days\" as an alien named Mork. The role led to his own TV series, \"Mork and Mindy.\" The comedian also landed a role in the film world with \"Popeye.\"\nWilliams' friends noted that while he loved being around people, he also \"cherished\" his alone time, and they began to see him struggle with his level of fame.\nSTARS WE'VE LOST IN 2023\n\"Robin's highs were so high and his lows were often low,\" his \"Mork and Mindy\" co-star Gina Hecht said during the documentary.\nDue to Williams' high-energy performance onstage, many speculated that the comedian had turned to cocaine, with some saying they would see the actor head to the back of The Comedy Store, where drugs were prevalent.\nWilliams' longtime friend Allan Stephan recalled a moment that led him to worry.\n\"He said, \u2018Know anybody with any blow? I have to go on. I can\u2019t go on without the blow.\u2019 And I sat down and said, \u2018I\u2019m going to help you,'\" Stephan claimed. \"He goes, \u2018You have blow?\u2019 I go, \u2018No, are you out of your f---ing mind? You\u2019re Robin Williams!\u2019\n\"And then I think after that he wouldn't get high when he had to perform.\"\nHowever, Williams continued to do drugs after his stand-up shows.\n\"When you did have that kind of fame, drugs were just given to you,\" Hecht noted.\nROBIN WILLIAMS' KIDS PAY TRIBUTE TO THE LATE ACTOR ON WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN HIS 72ND BIRTHDAY: \u2018LOVE YOU FOREVER\u2019\nFilmmaker and comedian Mike Binder recalled Williams' reaction to \"a gram of coke\" while the two were out in Hollywood in the '80s.\n\"Robin said, \u2018Let me take that. Do you mind if I grab a hit off that in the bathroom?\u2019\" Binder recalled in the documentary. \"He came back, and it was empty. It was like, \u2018Whoa.\u2019 It was like 8:15 at night.\"\n\"It was an accident, I'm sorry,\" Binder said the comedian responded after being called out for taking the entire gram.\n\"With drugs, he was a monster.\"\nWilliams began to weave cocaine into his stand-up jokes \u2014 which many laughed at, despite the light it shed on how deep the comedian was into his cocaine use.\n\"I can't tell you how many times Robin came onstage at The Comedy Store and a big part of his routine was cocaine and the drugs that he had done,\" Howie Mandel recalled. \"And even though everybody was laughing, and it was really funny, he was really doing a lot of cocaine. He found the funny side of it, but ultimately it was real and really, it's not funny, but that's who he is.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

Belushi died from a drug overdose in a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood, California.\nBelushi's death, along with the birth of Williams' first son in 1983, really helped the comedian clean up his drug addiction, according to the documentary.\nWilliams quit cocaine \"cold turkey,\" his longtime friend Stanley Wilson said.\n\"He knew what an amazing instrument that he had, and that it is all related to his mind and his imagination and his wit,\" Wilson added. \"The more stuff you do to deaden that, the more you\u2019re going to burn some more brain cells.

Williams reportedly appeared tired while on set and didn't seem to be his usual self before he died by suicide on Aug. 11, 2014.\nThe comedian was diagnosed with the neurological disorder posthumously after an autopsy was performed. Lewy body dementia is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's. The disease affects brain regions involved in thinking, memory and movement, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nThe autopsy found no illegal drugs or traces of alcohol in Williams' system.\n\"The last time I saw Robin Williams, I hadn\u2019t seen him for a few months, and he was thin, and he didn\u2019t recognize my wife,\" Steven Pearl, a comedian and friend, said during the documentary. \"He hardly said a word. It took him a second to recognize me. I go, \u2018Whoa, something\u2019s wrong here.\u2019 I didn't know what. Nobody would really tell me. And then I never saw him again after that.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Entertainment on 2023-10-19 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":227}
{"title":"Top ten craziest fight endings in boxing history \u2013 Floyd Mayweather\u2019s ruthless KO, Mike Tyson\u2019s bite and a baffled Lennox Lewis","context":"## Top ten craziest fight endings in boxing history \u2013 Floyd Mayweather\u2019s ruthless KO, Mike Tyson\u2019s bite and a baffled Lennox Lewis\n\nBeing knocked out by your opponent is always a danger in boxing \u2013 but imagine being taken out by the referee, a TV camera or a furious ringside viewer brandishing a high-heel shoe.\nWell, the fighters involved in talkSPORT\u2019s top ten craziest fight endings in boxing did not have to imagine it because it genuinely happened to some of them.\n7 Mike Tyson vs Evander Holyfield had one of the strangest endings to a fight Credit: getty\nTo be clear, we\u2019re not counting fights that finish in a terrible judges\u2019 decision or with Tyson Fury crooning in his surprisingly melodic singing voice.\nFor better or worse, those are common events in boxing. These ten-fight finales were a little more outlandish...\n10. Mayweather turns streetfighter\nFloyd Mayweather\u2019s last KO against an actual boxer (no offence, Conor McGregor\/Deji) was the most bizarre finishing sequence of his 50-bout pro career. Victor Ortiz blatantly headbutted \u2018Money\u2019 in 2011, got docked a point, then wanted to apologise by hugging it out.\nHowever, an angry Mayweather was having none of it and landed two cracking hooks while Ortiz had his hands by his side, knocking him out.\nThe ending sparked an argument between Mayweather and HBO analyst Larry Merchant, which ended with the 80-year-old proclaiming his desire to kick Floyd\u2019s ass.\nNot how anyone predicted this evening would end.\n7 Mayweather was headbutted by Ortiz, and so then knocked him out when he failed to protect himself Credit: Getty\n9. \u2018The Hitman\u2019 and the dad\nRicky Hatton was doing a number on Stephen Smith in his 30th fight when his elbow caught Smith and opened a cut.\nIt looked like an accident, but not to Smith\u2019s dad and cornerman, Darkie, who piled into the ring when his son went down and began shoving referee Mickey Vann.\nA disqualification followed, and considering it was in front of 15,000 fans in Manchester, the Smiths did well to make it back to the dressing room, just being pelted with cups filled with (hopefully) beer.\n\u201cBoxing used to be a clean and fair sport; it isn't any more,\" moaned Darkie.\n7 Hatton had an eventful night in 2002 Credit: Getty\n8. Hopkins KOd by referee\nUnsurprisingly, middleweight champ Bernard Hopkins was involved in an ugly, mauling fight against Robert Allen in 1998.\nBut referee Mills Lane\u2019s attempt to physically pull the clinching pair apart went badly wrong when he sent an off-balance Hopkins through the ropes and onto the floor.\nMaybe you just should have shouted \u2018break\u2019, Mills. It was a nasty spill, and Hopkins, lying ringside, claimed he was too injured to fight on.\nB-Hops joked he would \u2018sharpen my wrestling skills\u2019 for the rematch a year later, but this time, he knocked out Allen in round seven.\n7 The duo got to fight again in 2004\n7. KO in one second\nEfe Ajagba completed boxing in 2018, the then 5-0 heavyweight prospect beating Curtis Harper in the first second of round one.\nHe didn\u2019t even need to throw a punch as Harper waited for the opening bell, then calmly stepped between the ropes and strolled back to his dressing room.\nA baffled Ajagba celebrated his \u201cwin\u201d, while Harper later explained he was upset over a contract situation. You wonder why he bothered with the ring walk and referee\u2019s instructions.\nBut still, Ajagba got to 6-0 with an official KO1, 0:01. Harper has not fought since.\n6. Big Daddy goes WWE\nHow can a fight end with your opponent\u2019s manager dragging you over the top rope and out of the ring, only to finish up with you disqualified? Ask Elijah Tillery.\nThe heavyweight fought future world champ Riddick \u2018Big Daddy\u2019 Bowe in a bad-tempered bout in 1991. After the bell ended round one, Bowe landed a late jab in response to Tillery blowing him a kiss.\nTillery began kicking Bowe, and the pair brawled until Riddick\u2019s fiery manager, Rock Newman, leaned in from outside and hauled Tillery out of the ring via a crude WWE neckbreaker.\nAmid the chaos, the ref decided that Tillery\u2019s kicks were worthy of a DQ and called the insanity off.\n5. Kermit the Frog\nKermit Cintron had a pretty good career, crowned by a short stint as a welterweight world champion. Unfortunately, most boxing fans mainly recall him for just one thing: the unusual ending to his 2004 fight with Paul \u2018The Punisher\u2019 Williams.\nThe two got tangled up in round four, and while Williams fell to the canvas, Cintron dived head-first between the ropes and crashed into a table before hitting the floor. Pure momentum or oddly deliberate?\nEither way, when the Puerto Rican could not continue, the bout went to the scorecards, Williams winning while Cintron was carted away on a stretcher in a neck brace.\n7 Bowe was a fearsome heavyweight Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n4. TV camera stoppage\nIt may not have changed the end result, but Adolpho Washington can forever hold a grudge against ringside TV cameras. His 175lb world title challenge against Virgil Hill in 1993 ended when he went to sit down in his corner at the end of round 11, only for his swollen eye to hit an intrusive camera, causing a cut to open up.\nThe gash was so bad that the fight was called off, Hill declared a technical decision winner, and Washington denied the chance to go all-out in round 12. Chances are Hill was winning anyway, but stoppage via aggressive TV camera is surely unique in boxing history.\n3. McCall\u2019s tearful breakdown\nA hotly anticipated heavyweight world title fight, Lennox Lewis\u2019 attempt to avenge his upset defeat by Oliver McCall ended in a very different kind of \u2018upset\u2019 (the one where one boxer starts crying, stops throwing punches and eventually gets stopped for simply not trying).\nIron-chinned McCall battled drug addiction in the buildup to this 1997 bout and was arrested for throwing a Christmas tree across a hotel lobby.\nSo McCall was clearly not in the right mindset to trade leather with Lewis, as it showed when he began wandering around the ring in a world of his own.\nRef Mills Lane eventually just waved the bizarre spectacle off.\n7 McCall kept wandering off midway through the fight Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n2. Mrs Wilson\u2019s shoe\nBritish light-heavyweights Steve McCarthy and Tony Wilson met in 1989, with McCarthy scoring a third-round knockdown\nand then looking to finish the fight.\nAs the pair exchanged haymakers, an even more dangerous combatant entered the ring: Wilson\u2019s 62-year-old mother in a floral dress, who began whacking McCarthy with her shoe.\nMcCarthy celebrated his apparent victory, but strangely, this was not over. Referee Adrian Morgan insisted the fight must continue, and McCarthy refused, citing his head wound from the shoe (which would later require stitches).\nWilson was, therefore, declared the winner \u2013 via a massive assist from his mother.\n1. The bite fight\nIt is the most infamous ending in boxing history.\nBites in fights are not unknown, but the planet\u2019s most famous heavyweight \u2013 Mike Tyson \u2013 biting a chunk out of Evander Holyfield\u2019s ear, leaving him jumping around the ring in agony, in their 1997 rematch was something else. Not least because referee Mills Lane (why always him?) actually allowed it to continue.\nHowever, when a second nibble on Evander\u2019s other ear was spotted, Tyson was thrown out. At which point, he began violently trying to get across the crowded ring to Holyfield.\n\u2018Iron Mike\u2019 was fined $3 million and banned for 15 months, though he and Evander quickly made up and remain firm friends to this day \u2013 perhaps the weirdest outcome of all.\n\nThis article, authored by Michael Benson, was published by TalkSport on 2023-11-15 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":228}
{"title":"The best VPN services for 2023","context":"## The best VPN services for 2023\n\nEngadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nVirtual private networks (VPNs) have been having a moment recently. Massive marketing budgets and influencer collaborations have convinced consumers that a VPN\u2019s functionality and privacy features will solve all of their security woes. However, it\u2019s not as cut-and-dry as that. VPNs are just one part of a robust online security routine, but given the number of VPN services out there today, it can be hard to figure out which one will be right for you. Not to mention that you often have to dig through claims of attributes that aren\u2019t always totally accurate to get to that answer. We tested out nine of the best VPN services available now and landed on five top picks that should suit most people's needs.\nWhat is a VPN?\nVPNs, or virtual private networks, mask your IP address and the identity of your computer or mobile device on the network and creating an encrypted \"tunnel\" that prevents your internet service provider (ISP) from accessing data about your browsing history. VPNs are not a one-size-fits-all security solution, though.\nInstead, they\u2019re just one part of keeping your data private and secure. Roya Ensafi, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, told Engadget that VPNs don\u2019t protect against common threats like phishing attacks, nor do they protect your data from being stolen. Much of the data or information is stored with the VPN provider instead of your ISP, which means that using a poorly designed or unprotected network can still undermine your security. But they do come in handy for online privacy when you\u2019re connecting to an untrusted network somewhere public because they tunnel and encrypt your traffic to the next hop.\nThat means sweeping claims that seem promising, like military-grade encryption or total digital invisibility, may not be totally accurate. Instead, Yael Grauer, program manager of Consumer Reports\u2019 online security guide, recommends looking for security features like open-source software with reproducible builds, up-to-date support for industry-standard protocols like WireGuard (CR's preferred protocol) or IPsec, and the ability to defend against attack vectors like brute force.\nUnderstand your VPN needs\nBefore considering a VPN, make sure your online security is up to date in other ways. That means complex passwords, multifactor authentication methods and locking down your data sharing preferences. Even then, you probably don\u2019t need to be using a VPN all the time.\n\u201cIf you're just worried about somebody sitting there passively and looking at your data then a VPN is great,\u201d Jed Crandall, an associate professor at Arizona State University, told Engadget.\nIf you use public WiFi networks a lot, like while working at a coffee shop, then VPN usage can help give you private internet access. They\u2019re also helpful for hiding information from other people on your ISP if you don\u2019t want members of your household to know what you\u2019re up to online.\nGeoblocking has also become a popular use case as it helps you reach services in other parts of the world. For example, you can access shows that are only available on streaming services, like Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Prime, in other countries, or play online games with people located all over the globe.\nAre VPNs worth it?\nWhether or not VPNs are worth it depends how often you could use it for the above use cases. If you travel a lot and rely on public WiFi or hotspots, are looking to browse outside of your home country or want to keep your traffic hidden from your ISP, then investing in a VPN will be useful. But, keep in mind that even the best VPN services often slow down your internet connection speed, so they may not be ideal all the time.\nIn today's world, we recommend not relying on a VPN connection as your main cybersecurity tool. VPN use can provide a false sense of security, leaving you vulnerable to attack. Plus, if you choose just any VPN, it may not be as secure as just relying on your ISP. That\u2019s because the VPN could be based in a country with weaker data privacy regulation, obligated to hand information over to law enforcement or linked to weak user data protection policies.\nFor VPN users working in professions like activism or journalism that want to really strengthen their internet security, options like the Tor browser may be a worthwhile alternative, according to Crandall. Tor is free, and while it's less user-friendly, it\u2019s built for anonymity and privacy.\nHow we tested\nTo test the security specs of different VPNs and name our top picks, we relied on pre-existing academic work through Consumer Reports, VPNalyzer and other sources. We referenced privacy policies, transparency reports and security audits made available to the public. We also considered past security incidents like data breaches.\nWe looked at price, usage limits, effects on internet speed, possible use cases, ease of use, general functionality and additional \u201cextra\u201d VPN features like multihop. The VPNs were tested across iOS, Android and Mac devices so we could see the state of the mobile apps across various platforms (Windows devices are also supported in most cases). We used the \u201cquick connect\u201d feature on the VPN apps to connect to the \u201cfastest\u201d provider available when testing internet speed, access to IP address data and DNS and WebRTC leaks or when a fault in the encrypted tunnel reveals requests to an ISP.\nOtherwise, we conducted a test of geoblocking content by accessing Canada-exclusive Netflix releases, a streaming test by watching a news livestream on YouTube via a Hong Kong-based VPN and a gaming test by playing on servers in the United Kingdom. By performing these tests at the same time, it also allowed us to test claims about simultaneous device use. Here are the VPN services we tested:\nRead more: The best password managers for 2023\nBest VPN overall: ProtonVPN\nProton Proton VPN Best VPN overall Simultaneous connections : 10\nNumber of devices : 10\nPlatforms : Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux\nBrowser extensions : Chrome, Firefox\nDedicated IP addresses: Yes, for business users only\nTrial\/Money-back guarantee: None\/30-day money-back guarantee $4.99\/month at ProtonVPN\nThe VPNs we tried out ranked pretty consistently across all of our tests, but ProtonVPN stood out as a strong option because of its overall security and usability. The Proton Technologies suite of services includes mail, calendar, drive and a VPN known for its end-to-end encryption. This makes it a strong contender for overall security, but its VPN specifically came across as a well-rounded independent service.\nProtonVPN\u2019s no-logs policy has passed audits, and the company has proven not to comply with law enforcement requests. Because it is based in Switzerland, there are no forced logging obligations, according to the company. Plus, it\u2019s based on an open-source framework, and has an official vulnerability disclosure program along with clear definitions on what it does with personal information.\nWhile ProtonVPN offers a free version, it\u2019s limited compared to other options, with access to server networks in just three countries. Its paid version, starting at about $5.39 per month, includes access to VPN server locations in more than 65 countries on 10 devices at a time. For dedicated Proton Technologies users, they can pay closer to $8.63 for a monthly plan to access the entire suite.\nProtonVPN passed our geoblock, streaming and gaming tests with only a very small toll on connection speeds. It also comes with malware-, ad- and tracker-blocking as an additional service, plus it has a kill switch feature on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and the latest version of Android. It\u2019s available on most major operating systems, routers, TV services and more including Firefox, Linux and Android TV. For dedicated Linux users, ProtonVPN added a new Linux-specific app to support its services in August.\nRead our full VPN review of ProtonVPN\nBest free VPN: Windscribe\nWindscribe Windscribe Best free VPN Simultaneous connections : Unlimited\nNumber of devices : Unlimited\nPlatforms : Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux\nBrowser extensions : Chrome, Firefox\nDedicated IP addresses: No\nTrial\/Money-back guarantee: None\/None $0 at Windscribe\nBy signing up for Windscribe's free plan with your email, users can access 10GB per month of data, unlimited connections and access to more than 10 countries. We selected it as the best free VPN because of its high security and wide range of server locations compared to other free VPNs. It has over 500 servers in over 60 countries, according to the company, and can be configured to routers, smart TVs and more on top of the usual operating systems.\nWindscribe doesn\u2019t have a recent independent security audit, but it does publish a transparency report showing that it has complied with zero requests for its data, runs a vulnerability disclosure program encouraging researchers to report flaws and offers multiple protocols for users to connect with.\nOn top of that, it\u2019s easy to use. The set up is intuitive and it passed our geoblock, streaming and gaming tests. The paid version costs $5.75 to $9 each month, depending on the plan you choose, and includes unlimited data, access to all servers and an ad\/tracker\/malware blocker. Or, for $1 per location per month, users can build a plan tailored to the VPNs they want to access. Windscribe is still expanding its reach, adding Japan to its list of available spots.\nBest VPN for streaming services, frequent travel and gaming: ExpressVPN\nWe picked the best VPN service for travel, gaming and streaming based on which one had access to the most locations with high speed connections and no lag. ExpressVPN met all those criteria and was one of the fastest VPNs we tried. Now, it even comes with an in-house password manager, ExpressVPN Keys, to manage and autofill logins across sites included with the subscription. That will make it easier to toggle between streaming and gaming accounts while browsing securely.\nAn internet speed test measured faster upload and download speed compared to using no VPN, practically unheard of compared to the other VPNs tested. But being this fast is likely a fluke due to the VPN service circumventing traffic shaping by the ISP or another disparity because even top VPNs will in some way slow down speeds. With 2,000 servers in 160 cities, according to the company, it had one of the broadest global reaches. It also passed our geoblock, streaming and gaming tests, and it does regular security audits. Plus, Network Lock is its kill switch feature, which keeps your data safe even if you lose connection to the VPN. Subscription costs range from $8.32 to $12.95 per month depending on the term of the plan, and include a password manager.\nWith ExpressVPN, users can connect to up to five devices at once, which is on the lower side compared to other services. That said, it works on a bunch of devices from smart TVs to game consoles, unlike some other services that lack support beyond the usual suspects like smartphones and laptops.\nRead our full VPN review of Express VPN\nBest VPN for cross-platform accessibility: CyberGhost\nCyberGhost CyberGhost Best VPN for cross-platform accessibility Simultaneous connections : 7\nNumber of devices : 7\nPlatforms : Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux\nBrowser extensions : Chrome, Firefox\nDedicated IP addresses: Yes, additional purchase required\nTrial\/Money-back guarantee: 2 free months\/45-day money-back guarantee $2.11\/month at CyberGhost\nBecause several of the best VPN services connect to routers, cross-platform accessibility isn\u2019t always necessary. By connecting a VPN to your home router, you can actually connect to unlimited devices in your household, as long as they all access the internet through that router.\nBut if you use VPNs on the go, and across several devices, being able to connect to a wide range of platforms will be indispensable. CyberGhost offers simultaneous connectivity on up to seven devices for $2.11 to $12.99 per month depending on subscription term. It supports several types of gadgets like routers, computers, smart TVs and more. It\u2019s similar to the support that ExpressVPN offers, but CyberGhost provides detailed instructions on how to set up the cross-platform connections, making it a bit more user-friendly for those purposes. Plus, it just expanded its network of servers from 91 to 100 countries, adding Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic to its available locations.\nFrom a security perspective, CyberGhost completed an independent security audit by Deloitte earlier this year, runs a vulnerability disclosure program and provides access to a transparency report explaining requests for its data. An updated version of its transparency report went live in August. While it did pass all of our tests, it\u2019s worth noting that we had trouble connecting to servers in the United Kingdom and had to opt to run our gaming test through an Ireland-based server instead.\nBest VPN for multiple devices: Surfshark\nSurfshark Surfshark Best VPN for multiple devices Simultaneous connections : Unlimited\nNumber of devices : Unlimited\nPlatforms : Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Linux\nBrowser extensions : Chrome, Firefox, Edge\nDedicated IP addresses: Yes, additional purchase required\nTrial\/Money-back guarantee: 1 free month\/30-day money-back guarantee $2.49\/month at Surfshark\nAs we mentioned before, connecting to a router can provide nearly unlimited access to devices in a single household. But Surfshark VPN is one of few VPN services that offer use on an unlimited number of devices without bandwidth restrictions, according to the company. And you get that convenience without a significant increase in price: Surfshark subscriptions cost about $2.49 to $12.95 for a monthly subscription, and the company recently conducted its first independent audit. It added QR-code-enabled login across devices and expanded support for alternative ID profiles since our initial review, a feature that some of its competitors already had.\nWe ran into some trouble connecting to Surfshark\u2019s WireGuard protocol, but tested on an IKEv2 protocol instead. The VPN speed was a bit slow and struggled to connect for our geoblock test at first, but ultimately passed. What makes it different from other VPNs with unlimited connection options is that it has access to a larger number of servers and is available on more types of devices.\nRead our full VPN review of Surfshark VPN\nOther VPN services our experts tested\nNordVPN\nNordVPN didn\u2019t quite make the cut because it\u2019s overhyped, and underwhelming. As I've written in our full review of NordVPN, the pricing, up to $14.49 for a \u201ccomplete\u201d subscription, seemed high compared to other services, and its free or lower cost plans just didn\u2019t have the same wide variety of features as its competitors.\nTunnelBear\nDespite the cute graphics and user friendliness, TunnelBear wasn\u2019t a top choice. It failed numerous basic security tests from Consumer Reports, and had limited availability across platforms like Linux. It did, however, get a major security boost in July when it updated to support WireGuard protocol across more of its platforms.\nBitdefender VPN\nBitdefender doesn\u2019t offer support for devices like routers, which limits its cross-platform accessibility. It also lacked a transparency report or third-party audit to confirm security specs.\nAtlas VPN\nAtlas ranked lower on our speed tests compared to the other VPNs tested, with a notably slower difference on web browsing and streaming tests. It was a good option otherwise, but could easily cause headaches for those chasing high speed connections. Security-wise, an Atlas VPN vulnerability leaked Linux users\u2019 real IP addresses.\nFAQs\nWhat are some things VPNs are used for?\nVPNs are traditionally used to protect your internet traffic. If you\u2019re connected to an untrusted network like public WiFi in a cafe, using a VPN hides what you do from the internet service provider. Then, the owner of the WiFi or hackers trying to get into the system can\u2019t see the identity of your computer or your browsing history.\nA common non-textbook use case for VPNs has been accessing geographically restricted content. VPNs can mask your location, so even if you\u2019re based in the United States, they can make it appear as if you\u2019re browsing abroad and unblock access. This is especially useful for streaming content that\u2019s often limited to certain countries, like if you want to watch Canadian Netflix from the US.\nWhat information does a VPN hide?\nA VPN doesn\u2019t hide all of your data. It only hides information like your IP address, location and browser history. A common misconception is that VPNs can make you totally invisible online. But keep in mind that the VPN provider often still has access to all of this information, so it doesn\u2019t grant you total anonymity. You\u2019re also still vulnerable to phishing attacks, hacking and other cyberthreats that you should be mindful of by implementing strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.\nAre VPNs safe?\nGenerally, yes. VPNs are a safe and reliable way to encrypt and protect your internet data. But like most online services, the safety specifics vary from provider to provider. You can use resources like third-party audits, Consumer Reports reviews, transparency reports and privacy policies to understand the specifics of your chosen provider.\nWhat about Google\u2019s One VPN?\nAs of early 2023, Google One subscriptions include access to the company\u2019s VPN. It works similarly to other VPNs on our list, hiding your online activity from network operators. Google One subscribers can access the VPN in 22 countries on Android, iOS, Windows and Mac devices, and they can share VPN access with up to five people who are on their One plans. We have not fully tested the Google One VPN yet, but we will add it to this list if we feel it is.\nUpdate November 10, 2024: This story was updated after publishing to remove mention of PPTP, a protocol that Consumer Reports' Yael Grauer notes \"has serious security flaws.\"\n\nThis article, authored by Katie Malone, was published by Engadget on 2023-10-16 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":229}
{"title":"Keep Labs\u2019 smart storage redefines medication management","context":"## Keep Labs\u2019 smart storage redefines medication management\n\nKeep Labs built a lockable storage container for medicine, and it doesn\u2019t matter if the meds come in bottles, boxes or dime bags. The Keep is designed to hold them safely and track their use. The company launched in 2019, won \u2014 and lost \u2014 an innovation award at CES 2020, and this week started shipping its first product to consumers.\nThe Keep device is lovely. I have a test unit sitting on my bathroom vanity, and it looks more like a smart speaker than a secure box. There\u2019s a clock on the front and a soft matte finish. Click a button in the app, and the lid opens, revealing a space to hold about six bottles of pills. Or, with secure mode disabled, a double tap on the front opens the device without needing a smartphone.\nTake a pill or two? The Keep uses a sophisticated scale to detect the bottles that were returned just a little bit lighter, and this is recorded in the app. Didn\u2019t take your meds? The Keep knows and can trigger a smartphone notification on your or a companion\u2019s phone.\nTo the founders, Keep is more than just a secure box; it\u2019s a solution to harm reduction and medication management.\nI recently spoke with co-founder, president and chairman Philip Wilkins about the company\u2019s journey from a preorder success story to finding an enterprise offering by partnering with Canadian healthcare providers.\nFrom cannabis to medicine\nWilkins is an earnest entrepreneur. Spend a few minutes with him, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s passionate about solving the problem of safeguarding medicine.\nThis was the second time I spoke with him. The first was back In 2019 when his company won an innovation award at CES 2020. This award was later rescinded because the device was marketed as a cannabis storage device. In 2019, going into 2020, the trade group hosting CES had a strict but convoluted stance on cannabis products. Somehow, Keep Labs won an award. Eventually, someone at the CTIA noticed Keep Labs\u2019 marketing and pulled the prize. This set off a firestorm, eventually leading the CTIA to soften its stance on cannabis-adjacent products \u2014 after all, cannabis is legal in Nevada, where CES is held.\nThis experience has had a lasting affect on Keep Labs. Look at the website. Cannabis is not mentioned. The Keep is now marketed with the catch-all term \u201cmedicine.\u201d\n\u201cCannabis is still there,\u201d he said, noting that the company is still on the same mission of harm reduction. \u201cCannabis was a great way to start a conversation because everyone wants to talk about cannabis, but no one wants to talk about getting high.\u201d\nBy simply saying \u201cmedicine,\u201d the company feels like it found a good middle ground with its messaging. As Wilkins told me, Google and Meta heavily restrict the term \u201ccannabis\u201d in advertising, which limits the marketing reach of such devices as Keep. In advance of the launch, Keep Labs had to conduct preorders using a Shopify store because Kickstarter and Indiegogo also didn\u2019t allow products to be marketed with the term cannabis.\nPreorder success\nKeep was born from a familiar story. Wilkins was using medication to treat a new condition, and his wife was concerned about their three-year-old getting into the drugs. It\u2019s a growing struggle with many households, especially with the rise of cannabis edibles packaged to look like candy.\nAt the time, he looked at the market and saw several pill dispensing devices. \u201cThere were a lot of medication dispensing devices, but it was very clinical in nature. And so, like every crazy entrepreneur, [I said] \u2018let me see if I can go solve this problem for myself.'\u201d\nThe company saw early success despite not having a shipping product. They capitalized on the attention of getting kicked out of CES and in December 2019, launched a preorder campaign. Over 15,000 people preordered the device, with 5,000 paying in full. At the time, the preorder noted that all sales were final, but the company reversed course and offered everyone a refund when COVID hit, and Keep Labs lost its manufacturer. Philip said that only 5% of the preorders were canceled.\nA time out due to COVID\nThe COVID-19 pandemic changed Keep Labs. The company was heading toward production when the pandemic hit. Nearly overnight, all of their manufacturing contracts were canceled, leaving the preorders and the company up in the air.\n\u201cWhat the hell do we do now,\u201d Wilkins said, adding that they took a step back and started talking to their preorder customers \u2014 all of them. For the next year, the company spoke to two to three customers weekly about what made them preorder the device. \u201cWhat we found was that a lot of people were buying [the Keep] for medication tracking, and not for the primary use case of locking medication in a box.\u201d\nThis critical feedback led to Wilkins stepping down as CEO. He brought on Jeff Wandzura to lead the company.\nWandzura is a trained pharmacist who previously sold two digital health companies. Wilkins said he felt Wandzura\u2019s skills were complementary to his skill set, and it was the right thing to do for the company. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made throughout my career as Jeff grounded the company, has driven our enterprise success, and become a close friend.\u201d\n\u201cAs you can imagine, the pandemic brought about a lot of uncertainty, and we lost some good people,\u201d Wandzura told me. \u201cAfter I started speaking to preorder customers to understand why they bought Keep, it was clear that I needed a partner from the pharma\/pharmacy world.\n\u201cThe world of medication compliance is complex, and we needed the clinical knowledge on the team. I wasn\u2019t comfortable. And two, I\u2019ve always felt a strong fiduciary duty to my investors to make decisions in the company\u2019s best interest, which meant checking my ego at the door.\u201d\nWilkins continues to talk to customers. The company has an active beta program with 150 users, and he calls the top 10 users weekly to better understand their usage. He\u2019s discovered people are now using their Keep for other critical items like keys, passports and cash. He believes these additional use cases show users trust the device.\nWith Wandzura leading the company and with gobs of customer feedback, Keep Labs started exploring an enterprise offering focused on medication adherence along with harm reduction.\nThe company became part of the McKesson Digital Health Network in Canada to provide real-time data about whether patients are taking their medication. Keep Labs also has a partnership with Savvy Cooperative to give away free Keep devices to patients who are living with chronic conditions. These partnerships provide an invaluable feedback loop of front-line patients interacting with their devices.\n\u201cLet\u2019s make it super easy to deploy to individuals who need support,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cAnd we provide de-identified aggregate data to understand how many patients in the population are adhering [to their medications] and how many need intervention so they can understand patient behaviors at home. We charge a nominal subscription fee for that.\u201d\nI asked about how the company safeguards personal data and received the following statement that\u2019s worth reprinting in full:\n\u201cProtecting user privacy and ensuring data security are paramount for KEEP. We adhere to stringent data protection regulations such as HIPAA in the U.S. and PIPEDA in Canada to safeguard customer information. All data transmitted through KEEP is encrypted both in transit and at rest, utilizing robust encryption algorithms. Our platform employs multi-factor authentication, regular security audits, and penetration testing to protect against unauthorized access. Furthermore, we conduct ongoing staff training and adhere to a strict privacy policy to ensure that all members of our team are vigilant and adhere to the highest standards of data protection and software development including RBAC. This comprehensive, multi-layered approach to security ensures that patient information remains confidential and secure at all times.\u201d\nWilkins added that its encryption keys are generated on the fly within their production environment and securely stored. No individual has direct access to the keys. Data is transmitted using TLS 1.3 encryption, while data at rest is secured with AES-256 encryption. User passwords undergo hashing with PBKDF2 utilizing SHA256. The company uses automated tools such as Scan Hawk and Synk to test its security and provide code vulnerability assessments. He notes that their code is subject to peer reviews, and the company uses the Coalition Cybersecurity and Stendard to provide a final layer of external review.\nIt\u2019s worth applauding Keep Lab\u2019s security and privacy measures. The above shows a company that\u2019s proud of its efforts and is comfortable making them public.\nCooling meds is next for Keep\nWith its first product shipping to consumers, Keep Labs is exploring raising capital at the end of 2023 or early 2024. The company has raised $2.18 million from venture capital sources, including StartUp Health\u2019s Transformer Fund, Plug and Play Tech Center, Onbelay Capital and 001 Ventures.\nAngels have helped Keep Labs along the way, too. The company\u2019s advisory board includes former IBM Watson head Michael Rhodin.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of contracts we\u2019ll be announcing over the next several months, which is super exciting,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cAnd then after that, it\u2019s the launch of our second-gen product, which is the same as the original, except it\u2019s got a cooling device.\u201d\nHe explained that nearly 50% of the drugs in the FDA pipeline require cooling: \u201cOzempic is a great example, and people are keeping it in their fridge, next to their butter, and we\u2019ve heard from customers and enterprise partners that [adding cooling] could be a huge win.\u201d\nUntil then, the company\u2019s first-generation product is available from Keep Labs\u2019 website. It comes in black and white and costs $299.\n\nThis article, authored by Matt Burns, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-04 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":230}

The 15th-ranked Germans are under new management, so the USMNT will serve as the debut match for new head coach Julian Nagelsmann, the 36-year-old who has been out of a job since departing Bayern Munich back in March.\nMost European countries are busy with Euro 2024 qualifying, but the Germans are hosting the tournament and therefore qualify automatically, opening up their schedule for this friendly match.\nThen, on October 17, the U.S. will travel to GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tennessee for a friendly against Ghana. The two nations have a deep history of contentious matchups, including in three consecutive World Cup tournaments in 2006, 2010, and 2014.\nMORE: Breaking down Germany squad, tactics as Julian Nagelsmann debuts as manager\nUSA roster for October friendlies vs Germany, Ghana\nThe USMNT squad for the October friendlies was announced on Thursday, October 5. Gregg Berhalter has called in 23 players, which is one fewer than were brought in for the friendlies against Uzbekistan and Oman last month.\nBelow is the official 23-man roster for the upcoming October friendlies against Germany and Ghana.\nPSV midfielder Malik Tillman was forced to withdraw from the squad due to injury, with Alex Zendejas of Club America named to the roster in his place.\nMORE: Tracking every goal scored by Christian Pulisic at new club AC Milan\nPos Name Club Caps Goals GK Ethan Horvath Nott.

He was initially injured while playing for Leeds United back in March, and while he had finally recovered to make his Bournemouth debut in the EFL Cup in late September, he played just 20 minutes off the bench before suffering a setback, sidelined again for the foreseeable future.\nGio Reyna has returned from his leg fracture and is called in for the first time under Berhalter since their falling out at the 2022 World Cup. Also included is defender Cameron Carter-Vickers who only just made his debut for Celtic this season thanks to a hamstring injury. On the heels of that return just before the international break, he is called in.\nGoalkeepers Zack Steffen and Sean Johnson remain out of action due to injuries. Additionally, Josh Sargent is sidelined with a long-term ankle injury, while Daryl Dike is also out after tearing his Achilles. Also missing is Antonee Robinson, who Gregg Berhalter said is dealing with a sports hernia, and while he played through it last camp and recently for his club, it's affecting him and therefore rest is the best option here.\nJohnny Cardoso had to pull out of the September camp due to an ankle injury, but he has returned to action with Brazilian club Internacional, indicating a return to fitness, and has been included on the squad.\nWith Adams injured, there has been some noise on social media calling for Heidenheim midfielder Lennard Maloney to be brought into the squad in October, and he was given the call-up here. The 23-year-old was born in Berlin to an American father, appearing for the U.S. at the U-20 level in the past and stating his desire to reach the USMNT senior squad.\nMORE: All players in U.S. national team pool currently playing for a European club\nGio Reyna to make USMNT return under Gregg Berhalter\nThe ability of Berhalter and Reyna to work together moving forward has been a major talking point since the fallout of their saga after the 2022 World Cup.\nReyna's lack of playing time at the World Cup was exacerbated by the actions of his parents in the weeks that followed, which sparked a domestic violence investigation of Berhalter before his eventual re-hire as national team head coach.\nNow, having recovered from a leg fracture suffered in summer Nations League duty under an interim USMNT head coach, the 20-year-old Borussia Dortmund playmaker returns to the international fold under Berhalter for the first time.\nThe USMNT head coach has been forthcoming about the situation, admitting upon his re-hire that the two have a \"lot of work to do\" but insisting time was needed to broach the situation. With Berhalter having since confirmed the two have broken the ice and talked over the phone, they will now look to move forward without any more personal conflict.\nAfter the October roster release, Berhalter confirmed that the two spoke \"weeks ago\" on Zoom, with the U.S. head coach appreciative of Reyna's willingness to move forward. He spoke that because Reyna has not yet played for his club this season, their goal will be to \"get him minutes\" so he can build his fitness and return to Dortmund in the best position possible to begin his club campaign.\nBerhalter stated that they see Reyna being able to play three different positions: central midfielder, attacking midfielder, and winger, with further clarification being his skill-set fitting a \"between the lines\" style of wide play if he were deployed on the wing, as opposed to one glued to the touchline.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Bonn, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-04 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":231}

The Bayern star saw his shot saved onto the crossbar before the ball spun in on the goal line.\nThis gave Canada a 3-1 aggregate lead and if it wasn't for Jamaican stopper Andre Blake, there could have easily been a couple more goals, making two great saves from Cyle Larin prior to Davies' opener.\nHowever, the home side couldn't get the second goal and Jamaica grew in confidence, particularly after half-time.\nIn three second-half minutes, the tie was blown apart by two goals from Shamar Nicholson. A Canadian mistake handed the first to him on a plate before Demarai Gray's individual brilliance set up the second for a tap-in.\nWith the scoreline 2-1 on the night, the match was destined for extra time and penalties with a 3-3 aggregate.\nBut Jamaica could barely contemplate possible glory before Ismael Kone's header made it 2-2 on the night and gave Canada a single-goal aggregate advantage.\nIt appeared as if Canada had weathered the storm until first-leg hero Stephen Eustaquio's handball in the box allowed De Cordova-Reid to score the winning penalty with 12 minutes of regulation to play.\nJamaica managed to hold on through nine minutes of stoppage time, despite Gray being given a second yellow card for dissent on 84 minutes.\nCanada vs Jamaica live updates, highlights, commentary\nFulltime: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\nJamaica's first-ever win on Canadian soil sees them advance by away goals to the CONCACAF Nations League semi-final and Copa America 2024.

Hoilett blasts a shot well over the bar from outside the box.\n90 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\nThere will be nine minutes of added-on time. As it stands Jamaica are through on away goals. What a result this could be.\n88 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\nCanada are dominating with their man advantage. David gets a free header in the six-yard box but it balloons over the bar. That was a decent chance.\n84 mins: RED CARD (Demarai Gray) Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\nWhat a brain-fade by Jamaica's Gray. He gets two yellow cards in a minute and is dismissed. He booted the ball away for no reason. Clear second yellow card. Can they hold on now?\n83 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate\nWhat an incredible result this would be for Jamaica. Especially when Canada were cruising with a 3-1 aggregate lead until the 62nd minute.\n78 mins: GOAL - Canada 2-3 Jamaica (Bobby De Cordova-Reid), 4-4 aggregate\nJamaica are going through as it stands on away goals. The Fulham attacker converts from the spot after a handball from Eustaquio and they are back in front on the night.\n74 mins: Canada 2-2 Jamaica, 4-3 aggregate\nTriple change for Canada. Junior Hoilett, Jonathan Osorio and Mark Kaye come on for Cyle Larin, Ismael Larin and Tajon Buchanan.\n69 mins: GOAL - Canada 2-2 (Ismael Kone), 4-3 aggregate\nCanada strike back. What an absolute rollercoaster. Davies floats in a deft cross and Kone's redirects it over Blake to send the crowd wild. Canada progressing on aggregate as we stand. It's on Jamaica now.\n66 mins: GOAL - Canada 1-2 (Shamar Nicholson), 3-3 aggregate\nWOW. Jamaica have hit the front and we are even on aggregate. What a counter-attack. Gray sprung clear down the left and his ball was prodded in by Nicholson. Incredible turnaround. As it stands, extra time is on the table.\n62 mins: GOAL - Canada 1-1 Jamaica (Shamar Nicholson), 3-2 aggregate\nTHEY ARE BACK! Lowe takes the ball away from the Canadian defender. He feeds Nicholson in the box and the big striker smashes the ball home. We have a game now.\n57 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nThe match has settled significantly after an early onslaught from Jamaica. They seem to be deflated by missing the chance to equalise this leg. They need to find something.\n52 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nBeen a great start to the half by Jamaica. Constant pressure. Bailey looks dangerous. Canada needs to ride this storm.\n48 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nBailey strikes the crossbar. The Aston Villa winger's shot hits the underside of the bar, bounces on the line and is cleared. Jamaica appeal in vain that the ball crossed the line. Ridiculously close to an equaliser.\nSecond half: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nWe are underway in the second period. Can Jamaica strike early or will it be a Canadian cruise?\nHalftime: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nIt's been relatively smooth sailing for the Canadians with a single goal giving them a two-goal aggregate advantage. It could have been more goals if it wasn't for the heroics of Andre Blake. Jamaica are going to need a miracle in the second half. One goal could make the home side nervous.\n45 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nTwo minutes of time added on.\n45 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nWow. Oh so close for Jamaica. Gray cuts in from the left. Delivers a delicious ball through the six-yard box but Nicholson can't quite get his head on the ball. Inches away from connection there.\n43 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nJamaica need to get to half-time. A second goal from Canada would end this tie. Davies threatens down the left once again but is flagged for offside.\n37 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nEustaquiao swings the free kick into the back post and Miller just can't get his head to it. That was nearly a perfect delivery. It feels like a second goal is coming.\n35 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nCanada look dangerous on the break. Davies breaks down the left. He drills a low ball through the penalty box but it deflects off a defender's legs and bounces to safety. Jamaica have to be wary or this match will be over shortly.\n31 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nGray plays the ball across the six-yard box, Bailey stabs the ball on goal but it's straight into the arms of Borjan. Jamaica's best chance so far.\n29 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate\nNicholson finds himself through on goal for Jamaica after the lofted pass but he can only spoon a shot well wide. In any case, the offside flag is raised once the play is over.\n25 mins: GOAL - Canada 1-0 Jamaica (Alphonso Davies), 3-1 aggregate\nAnd there it is. Canada take the lead through Alphonso Davies. The Bayern star initially sprays the ball out wide to David, who plays an inch-perfect pass to Davies in the six-yard box. Blake blocked Davies' goal-bound effort but it looped up, hit the crossbar and then spun in, with Larin making sure he didn't touch the ball in case he was offside.\n21 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\nStill goalless here at BMO Field. Canada look the more dangerous team with Jamaica threatening sporadically.\n15 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\nAnother save from Blake. This one might be the pick of the bunch. David pokes the ball to Larin in the six-yard box, but his low shot hits the body of Blake, who is in the right position once again. Only looks like a matter of time until Canada open the scoring.\n12 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\nBuchanan plays a lovely ball over the top to Larin. The Canadian striker is through on goal. He muscles his way through but the shot is saved by Blake. Belatedly, the assistant referee raises his flag for offside on Larin's initial run.\n9 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\nWhat a save from Andre Blake. Keeps Jamaica in touch in the tie. Buchanan played an enticing ball across the six-yard box, Lowe made a good connection with the slide at the back post but Blake got his body in the way. Impressive block.\n7 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\nJohnson sends in a deep free kick for Jamaica but it's cleared for a corner. The first of the match. Johnson takes the corner but it's poorly delivered and Canada eventually clear.\n4 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\nThe home side has started confidently on the ball. It's going to be a tough task for Jamaica. They have never beaten Canada on the road.\nKickoff: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate\nWe are off and running at BMO Field, Toronto.

{"title":"A scientist reckons with climate grief","context":"## A scientist reckons with climate grief\n\nBELFAST, Maine \u2014 How does it feel to be a climate scientist in 2023?\nLet\u2019s set the scene. Hundreds of picnickers are sprawled across a lawn speckled with colorful blankets. Yachts bob in the bay. Guitars blare, children wrestle and dancers twirl across a concert lawn in the golden glow of a dying summer night.\nIt\u2019s a picture-perfect August evening for the seaside town of Belfast\u2019s \u201cSummer Nights\u201d concert series.\nOff to the side, Peter Kalmus sits alone. His eyes are closed. His toes are tucked beneath his body. He\u2019s catching an occasional side-eye from onlookers.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m meditating, I don\u2019t feel anxious,\u201d Kalmus later says, explaining that he strives for two hours of meditation a day to keep his climate anxiety at bay. Otherwise, \u201cit\u2019s completely overwhelming.\u201d\nMany of us avoid thinking too deeply about the worst scenarios of climate change. He is fixated on them.\nKalmus, 49, thinks civilization is on the path to break down, the Biden administration is clueless on climate, and that he might get fired from his job at NASA if he is arrested for a third time protesting what he views as downright madness: the continued use of fossil fuels.\nKalmus visited the seaside town of Belfast, Maine, in July and August to visit the Possibility Alliance homestead as he looked for inspiration on how to best live with the effects climate change. (Evan Bush \/ NBC News)\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird and lonely,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to talk about this stuff at parties.\u201d\nKalmus, whose strident tweets reach some 340,000 followers on X, is at the vanguard of a group of scientists who are increasingly disillusioned and growing convinced that more radical action is needed to wake up political leaders. He has been on a 15-year quest to halt climate change and has already oriented most everything in his life to minimize his own climate footprint and maximize what he can do to push society to change.\nNothing has been enough.\nAnd so this summer, as extreme heat and rainfall battered many American communities, Kalmus visited Maine searching for something different. He was looking not for climate solutions, but for new ways to withstand climate change\u2019s harms \u2014 and also to make peace with the grief that often feels inescapable for those who reckon with global warming daily.\nclimate scientist exercise bicycle environmentalist (Evan Bush \/ NBC News)\nThat search brought him to an unusual community called the Possibility Alliance, a homestead where a small group of people is trying to figure out how to live in a world headed for a breakdown (as they see it).\nIts leaders eschew capitalism, grow much of their own food, and live without electricity. They\u2019ve dedicated their lives to protest, living off the land as simply as possible, and are preparing their community for ecological disaster and to host climate refugees.\nWhile on his working vacation in Maine, Kalmus invited NBC News for a short visit to the community to see the crisis through the eyes of Americans taking it as seriously as anyone.\nThe Possibility Alliance is an 11-acre homestead that operates without power, running water or a sewer system. The Hughes family, which operates the alliance, pays only one monthly bill for landline phone service. (Evan Bush \/ NBC News)\nDetoxifying\nAbout a decade ago, Kalmus ditched a promising academic career in astrophysics to study the physics of climate change instead.\nHe made other changes too. He stopped flying, became a vegetarian and ditched gasoline-powered cars (he drives a Tesla), cutting his personal emissions by about 90%, according to his math.\nIt wasn\u2019t a political statement, but a detoxification.\n\u201cBurning fossil fuels started to feel more and more disgusting,\u201d he said.\nEthan Hughes, who operates the Possibility Alliance, rejects globalization and thinks capitalism is a ruinous symptom of \u201cgreed and separation.\u201d He\u2019s trying to build a gift economy in Belfast, in which neighbors share resources and services with no expectation of repayment. \u201cI\u2019m trying to role-model post-petrol,\u201d Hughes said. (Evan Bush \/ NBC News)\nKalmus, now a married father of two teenagers, is introspective, earnest and narrowly focused on climate change in both his personal and professional life. Tall with an athletic build, a neat beard and a tangle of messy hair that has a skunklike streak of white, he can sometimes come off like an overgrown teenager: He\u2019s the smartest person in the room, brimming with idealism and still indignant \u2014 with a zeal many adults can no longer muster \u2014 about how life\u2019s most annoying systems work (like the U.S. medical system, a symptom of what he calls the \u201ccapitalist death cult\u201d).\nThe changes he made weren\u2019t enough. Kalmus wrote a book on climate change and chained himself to a Chase bank in protest of fossil fuel financing. Twice, he\u2019s been arrested during climate protests.\nHis social media posts often evoke heartbreak.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of losing basically everything,\u201d he wrote recently on X.\nIs anyone listening?\nclimate scientist natural farming (Evan Bush \/ NBC News)\nNot his suburban neighbors in North Carolina, who continue to drive emissions-belching SUVs to big-box stores. Perhaps not even some in the science community, like those who kicked him out of the American Geophysical Union\u2019s annual fall meeting last year after he unfurled a banner and protested on the major science conference\u2019s biggest stage.\nHe has grown increasingly frustrated with President Joe Biden, who signed the Inflation Reduction Act as his signature climate bill. Kalmus thinks it does too little to shut out the fossil fuel industry.\n(Rhodium Group, a nonpartisan think tank, estimates greenhouse gas emissions will drop 32%-42% below 2005 levels by 2030, well short of Biden\u2019s own benchmark for progress. The inflation bill is responsible for about a quarter of that projected decrease.)\n\u201cHe brags about how he thinks we should consider him a climate champion because he reentered the Paris accord. That Paris Agreement will take us to about 3 degrees Celsius of global heating,\u201d Kalmus said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a civilization at 3 degrees Celsius.\u201d\n(A 2022 United Nations report estimated global temperatures would rise between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2100 if countries held to their climate commitments. Many countries remain off that pace.)\nClimate change is weighing on scientists, but also everyday Americans.\nA 2022 poll found almost two-thirds of Americans say they have been affected by extreme weather they believe was at least partially due to climate change.\nAbout 27% of Americans say they are \u201cvery worried\u201d about climate change; another 27% just avoid the subject as best they can. One in 10 reported feeling symptoms of anxiety or depression over climate change.\nNo place is safe\nTo Kalmus, the best answer he\u2019s found has been to channel his frustrations into protest and civil disobedience, finding community and purpose at the Mountain Valley Pipeline protests and on the streets of New York City during its Climate Week. Outside of meditation, speaking his mind at these events has been the best antidote to his climate despair.\nWhen he earned his first arrest, by chaining himself to a bank in Los Angeles last year, he finally felt acknowledged.\nclimate scientist arrest (Courtesy Brian Emerson\/Climate Ad Project)\n\u201cIt was a good combination of risk and sort of communicating emotional truth. So I was able to dig really deep, and say exactly how I felt in the moment,\u201d he said.\nHis outburst went viral. His employer, NASA, sent him a letter expressing concern over his two arrests, he says.\n(\u201cI\u2019m speaking on my own behalf and that has to be super clear,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNot as a NASA climate scientist. That\u2019s really important for retaining my job.\u201d)\nHe worries a third arrest could cost him.\n\u201cDo I keep doing science? Or do I, you know, keep engaging in risky activism and maybe lose that job?\u201d Kalmus said.\nMeanwhile, Kalmus has grown frustrated that more scientists aren\u2019t agitating at protests and willing to face arrest. And his view of our climate predicament has grown increasingly dark.\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s worse than I thought it would be in 2023,\u201d Kalmus said, pointing to record-low Antarctic sea ice and record-high sea surface and land temperatures as signs that Earth systems could be shifting more quickly than the scientific community can grasp.\nIn recent years, climate change has begun to sting Kalmus\u2019 personal life.\nIn summer 2020, he sickened himself hiking in a California heat wave, then watched a wildfire burn a few miles from his California home, spewing smoke that left his voice raspy and his head aching. The searing temperatures killed a dogwood tree in his front yard. His productivity slowed \u2014 he couldn\u2019t focus on science.\nKalmus had dreamed of making a life in the Pacific Northwest, which he felt might be buffered from the worst of climate change. That same year, a heat wave \u2014 considered nearly impossible if not for the influence of climate change \u2014 seared the region for three days, killing hundreds of people, buckling roadways and sending overheated baby birds jumping from their nests and to their deaths.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that no place was safe,\u201d Kalmus said. His family relocated to North Carolina, for his wife Sharon\u2019s work, but the experience planted a seed:\nIf he couldn\u2019t stop climate change and he couldn\u2019t avoid it, could he at least find a better way to survive it?\nLife at the homestead\nKalmus knew what would not work.\n\u201cI very quickly eliminated the idea of being a prepper \u2014 you know, hoarding beans and ammunition,\u201d he said.\nBut he found himself daydreaming of a simpler life, where he could keep bees, grow vegetables and press cider to drink on a Friday night and live closer to the land.\nVisiting the Possibility Alliance, a sprawling 11-acre homestead filled with fruit trees, goats, chickens and a garden, allowed him to scratch an itch he\u2019d entertained for much of his adult life.\nThe Hughes family, which operates the homestead, and its guests live largely without electricity or modern technology.\nThe family of four doesn\u2019t fly because of climate concerns and also doesn't own a car. Their main use of fossil fuels is to take passenger trains to climate protests.\nThey try to eschew capitalism and have built, instead, a \"gift economy\" where resources are shared and skills are traded among neighbors in this tiny corner of Maine. They grow much of their own food, hold trainings for climate protesters and plan to host refugees as climate disasters worsen.\nNights are illuminated by candlelight. Neighbors drop by without notice.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created what existed 100 years ago,\u201d Ethan Hughes said.\nOn a steamy August morning, Kalmus found himself huddled around a faded picnic table at the center of the homestead in Belfast, Maine, sipping his coffee with a rare breed \u2014 people as alarmed by climate change as him.\nclimate scientist environmental (Evan Bush \/ NBC News)\nEthan, the charismatic, folksy co-founder of the Possibility Alliance, started the day off with a poem about a deer in the forest and then began to outline daily chores \u2014 chopping wood, building a new deck, caring for goats.\nSoon, talk turned to climate change and Kalmus\u2019 grief began to flow as he shared findings from unpublished research on his projections of heat in moderate emissions scenarios through the year 2300.\n\u201cEven in the coolest time of day, people will be dying if they don\u2019t have air conditioning,\u201d Kalmus told the group.\n\u201cEverything is already spinning out of control,\u201d said Sarah Wilcox-Hughes, dismayed.\nKalmus opened up to the table. He\u2019d been procrastinating for months on finishing the research and he was running into his \u201cpsychological limitations.\u201d He felt he was letting the planet down.\n\u201cAnyone want to rub Peter\u2019s shoulders as he writes?\u201d Ethan said.\nLater, Kalmus relayed a recent, gloomy conversation with a fellow scientist.\n\u201cThe Amazon is probably past its tipping point,\u201d Kalmus said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe that it happened during my lifetime.\u201d\nPeter Kalmus sits with his son Zane on a porch swing at the Possibility Alliance. (Evan Bush \/ NBC News)\nCrickets trilled. Roosters crowed. A tear dripped down Ethan\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cLet\u2019s dedicate our work today to the Amazon,\u201d Ethan said, outlining for the group how the work planned would sequester carbon and show people they could live without fossil fuels and that they could take meaningful action against climate change, even as world governments failed them.\n(Estimates of when the Amazon could \u201ctip\u201d and transition to savannah vary. Timothy Lenton, a University of Exeter professor who studies climate tipping points and the Amazon\u2019s resilience, said most estimates suggest the Amazon could cross a threshold as soon as 2 degrees C of warming.)\nLife at the Possibility Alliance carried on. Will Foley, who hitchhiked from Florida to stay at the homestead, swung a scythe to clear brush. Frankie Williams and Max Kurke, recent college graduates living at the alliance as summer apprentices, piled wood while wearing oversize sun hats. Ethan corralled goats for \u201cmob grazing,\u201d a process he says helps sequester carbon.\nKalmus, trailed by a reporter, buzzed around the homestead like a giddy kid, hiking back and forth to a home in an eco-village near the Possibility Alliance where he was living and working on his research. He tramped down a forest trail in bare feet, paused work for a midday dip in a shady stream and never changed his T-shirt.\nHe ground his coffee with a mortar and pestle, thumbed through a book of Enneagram personality types on the porch with his son Zane and listened to Ethan\u2019s stories about sailing across the Atlantic in a cargo ship to avoid the carbon emissions of flying.\n\u201cI feel met by Peter,\u201d Sarah Wilcox-Hughes said of Kalmus. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like there are many people prioritizing the needs of the planet as he is and we are.\u201d\nKalmus found life in Belfast, and at the Possibility Alliance, slower, richer and more connected to the natural world.\nDuring his time in Belfast, Kalmus strummed a mandolin in a Celtic folk music group that meets at the eco-village, along with his son Zane, Wilcox-Hughes and her daughter, Etta. He picked berries and ate fresh goat cheese and helped Ethan load hay into a neighbor\u2019s barn.\nclimate scientist music group (Evan Bush \/ NBC News)\nHe spoke at the local library about climate change. He shared art, food and labor with neighbors. He saw how a community was sprouting up around the Possibility Alliance \u2014 people willing to sacrifice the conveniences of a modern life built on fossil fuels.\nHe felt safer here and more energized to work.\nIt wasn\u2019t about the place, but the people, he realized.\nPeople at the center\nMaine, like anywhere else, isn\u2019t immune to climate change. But here, at least, he had people who understood his angst, who could share music and joy, who were willing to make their own sacrifices, and who were trying to prepare their community in the way they thought was best.\nMonths later, after returning \u201ckicking and screaming\u201d to the \u201cquote-unquote real world,\u201d Kalmus was planning a return trip to the Possibility Alliance over the winter holidays.\nHe was still mulling why the Possibility Alliance\u2019s \u201clow energy\u201d lifestyle had felt so meaningful and what was missing from modern life.\nEthan Hughes his goats out to\n\u201cEverything is too fast,\u201d Kalmus said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to a lot of people, but it\u2019s a new revelation to me. There\u2019s nothing more important in life than relationships.\u201d\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com\n\nThis article was published by Yahoo News on 2023-12-24 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":233}
{"title":"Hitting the Books: We are the frogs in the boiling pot, it's time we started governing like it.","context":"## Hitting the Books: We are the frogs in the boiling pot, it's time we started governing like it.\n\nClimate change isn't going away, and it isn't going to get any better \u2014 at least if we keep legislating as we have been. In Democracy in a Hotter Time: Climate Change and Democratic Transformation, a multidisciplinary collection of subject matter experts discuss the increasingly intertwined fates of American ecology and democracy, arguing that only by strengthening our existing institutions will we be able to weather the oncoming \"long emergency.\"\nIn the excerpt below, contributing author and Assistant Professor of Environment and Sustainability at the University at Buffalo, Holly Jean Buck, explores how accelerating climate change, the modern internet and authoritarianism's recent renaissance are influencing and amplifying one another's negative impacts, to the detriment of us all.\nMIT Press\nExcerpted from Democracy in a Hotter Time: Climate Change and Democratic Transformation, edited by David W. Orr. Published by MIT Press. Copyright \u00a9 2023. All rights reserved.\nBurning hills and glowing red skies, stone-dry riverbeds, expanses of brown water engulfing tiny human rooftops. This is the setting for the twenty-first century. What is the plot? For many of us working on climate and energy, the story of this century is about making the energy transition happen. This is when we completely transform both energy and land use in order to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change \u2014 or fail to.\nConfronting authoritarianism is even more urgent. About four billion people, or 54 percent of the world, in ninety-five countries, live under tyranny in fully authoritarian or competitive authoritarian regimes. The twenty-first century is also about the struggle against new and rising forms of authoritarianism. In this narration, the twenty-first century began with a wave of crushed democratic uprisings and continued with the election of authoritarian leaders around the world who began to dismantle democratic institutions. Any illusion of the success of globalization, or of the twenty-first century representing a break from the brutal twentieth century, was stripped away with Russia\u2019s most recent invasion of Ukraine. The plot is less clear, given the failure of democracy-building efforts in the twentieth century. There is a faintly discernable storyline of general resistance and rebuilding imperfect democracies.\nThere\u2019s also a third story about this century: the penetration of the Internet into every sphere of daily, social, and political life. Despite turn-of-the-century talk about the Information Age, we are only beginning to conceptualize what this means. Right now, the current plot is about the centralization of discourse on a few corporate platforms. The rise of the platforms brings potential to network democratic uprisings, as well as buoy authoritarian leaders through post-truth memes and algorithms optimized to dish out anger and hatred. This is a more challenging story to narrate, because the setting is everywhere. The story unfolds in our bedrooms while we should be sleeping or waking up, filling the most quotidian moments of waiting in line in the grocery store or while in transit. The characters are us, even more intimately than with climate change. It makes it hard to see the shape and meaning of this story. And while we are increasingly aware of the influence that shifting our media and social lives onto big tech platforms has on our democracy, less attention is devoted to the influence this has on our ability to respond to climate change.\nThink about these three forces meeting \u2014 climate change, authoritarianism, the Internet. What comes to mind? If you recombine the familiar characters from these stories, perhaps it looks like climate activists using the capabilities of the Internet to further both networked protest and energy democracy. In particular, advocacy for a version of \u201cenergy democracy\u201d that looks like wind, water, and solar; decentralized systems; and local community control of energy.\nIn this essay, I would like to suggest that this is not actually where the three forces of rising authoritarianism x climate change x tech platforms domination leads. Rather, the political economy of online media has boxed us into a social landscape wherein both the political consensus and the infrastructure we need for the energy transition is impossible to build. The current configuration of the Internet is a key obstacle to climate action.\nThe possibilities of climate action exist within a media ecosystem that has monetized our attention and that profits from our hate and division. Algorithms that reap advertising profits from maximizing time-on-site have figured out that what keeps us clicking is anger. Even worse, the system is addictive, with notifications delivering hits of dopamine in a part of what historian and addiction expert David Courtwright calls \u201climbic capitalism.\u201d Society has more or less sleepwalked into this outrage-industrial complex without having a real analytic framework for understanding it. The tech platforms and some research groups or think tanks offer up \u201cmisinformation\u201d or \u201cdisinformation\u201d as the framework, which present the problem as if the problem is bad content poisoning the well, rather than the structure itself being rotten. As Evgeny Morozov has quipped, \u201cPost-truth is to digital capitalism what pollution is to fossil capitalism \u2014 a by-product of operations.\u201d\nA number of works outline the contours and dynamics of the current media ecology and what it does \u2014 Siva Vaidhyanathan\u2019s Antisocial Media, Safiya U. Noble\u2019s Algorithms of Oppression, Geert Lovink\u2019s Sad by Design, Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s Surveillance Capitalism, Richard Seymour\u2019s The Twittering Machine, Tim Hwang\u2019s Subprime Attention Crisis, Tressie McMillan Cottom\u2019s writing on how to understand the social relations of Internet technologies through racial capitalism, and many more. At the same time, there\u2019s reasonable counter-discussion about how many of our problems can really be laid at the feet of social media. The research on the impacts of social media on political dysfunction, mental health, and society writ large does not paint a neat portrait. Scholars have argued that putting too much emphasis on the platforms can be too simplistic and reeks of technological determinism; they have also pointed out that cultures like the United States\u2019 and the legacy media have a long history with post-truth. That said, there are certainly dynamics going on that we did not anticipate, and we don\u2019t seem quite sure what to do with them, even with multiple areas of scholarship in communication, disinformation, and social media and democracy working on these inquiries for years.\nWhat seems clear is that the Internet is not the connectedness we imagined. The ecology and spirituality of the 1960s, which shaped and structured much of what we see as energy democracy and the good future today, told us we were all connected. Globally networked \u2014 it sounds familiar, like a fevered dream from the 1980s or 1990s, a dream that in turn had its roots in the 1960s and before. Media theorist Geert Lovink reflects on a 1996 interview with John Perry Barlow, Electronic Frontier Foundation cofounder and Grateful Dead lyricist, in which Barlow was describing how cyberspace was connecting each and every synapse of all citizens on the planet. As Lovink writes, \u201cApart from the so-called last billion we\u2019re there now. This is what we can all agree on. The corona crisis is the first Event in World History where the internet doesn\u2019t merely play \u2018a role\u2019 \u2014 the Event coincides with the Net. There\u2019s a deep irony to this. The virus and the network ... sigh, that\u2019s an old trope, right?\u201d Indeed, read through one cultural history, it seems obvious that we would reach this point of being globally networked, and that the Internet would not just \u201cplay a role\u201d in global events like COVID-19 or climate change, but shape them.\nWhat if the Internet actually has connected us, more deeply than we normally give it credit for? What if the we\u2019re-all-connected-ness imagined in the latter half of the twentieth century is in fact showing up, but manifesting late, and not at all like we thought? We really are connected \u2014 but our global body is neither a psychedelic collective consciousness nor a infrastructure for data transmission comprising information packets and code. It seems that we\u2019ve made a collective brain that doesn\u2019t act much like a computer at all. It runs on data, code, binary digits \u2014 but it acts emotionally, irrationally, in a fight-or-flight way, and without consciousness. It\u2019s an entity that operates as an emotional toddler, rather than with the neat computational sensing capacity that stock graphics of \u201cthe Internet\u201d convey. Thinking of it as data or information is the same as thinking that a network of cells is a person.\nThe thing we\u2019re jacked into and collectively creating seems more like a global endocrine system than anything we might have visualized in the years while \u201ccyber\u201d was a prefix. This may seem a banal observation, given that Marshall McLuhan was talking about the global nervous system more than fifty years ago. We had enthusiasm about cybernetics and global connectivity over the decades and, more recently, a revitalization of theory about networks and kinship and rhizomes and all the rest. (The irony is that with fifty years of talk on \u201csystems thinking,\u201d we still have responses to things like COVID-19 or climate that are almost antithetical to considering interconnected systems \u2014 dominated by one set of expertise and failing to incorporate the social sciences and humanities). So \u2014 globally connected, yet divided into silos, camps, echo-chambers, and so on. Social media platforms are acting as agents, structuring our interactions and our spaces for dialogue and solution-building. Authoritarians know this, and this is why they have troll farms that can manipulate the range of solutions and the sentiments about them.\nThe Internet as we experience it represents a central obstacle to climate action, through several mechanisms. Promotion of false information about climate change is only one of them. There\u2019s general political polarization, which inhibits the coalitions we need to build to realize clean energy, as well as creates paralyzing infighting within the climate movement about strategies, which the platforms benefit from. There\u2019s networked opposition to the infrastructure we need for the energy transition. There\u2019s the constant distraction from the climate crisis, in the form of the churning scandals of the day, in an attention economy where all topics compete for mental energy. And there\u2019s the drain of time and attention spent on these platforms rather than in real-world actions.\nAny of these areas are worth spending time on, but this essay focuses on how the contemporary media ecology interferes with climate strategy and infrastructure in particular. To understand the dynamic, we need to take a closer look at the concept of energy democracy, as generally understood by the climate movement, and its tenets: renewable, small-scale systems, and community control. The bitter irony of the current moment is that it\u2019s not just rising authoritarianism that is blocking us from good futures. It\u2019s also our narrow and warped conceptions of democracy that are trapping us.\nThis article contains affilate links; if you click such a link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission.\n\nThis article, authored by Andrew Tarantola, was published by Engadget on 2023-10-01 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":234}

{"title":"The best controllers for PC gaming","context":"## The best controllers for PC gaming\n\nYour time \u2014 and money \u2014 is precious. Polygon\u2019s What to Buy has rounded up the best in gaming hardware, entertainment, tabletop, merch, and toys, and how to get them for the best value, so you spend less time shopping and more time enjoying.\nFinding the best controller for playing PC games is a more personal journey than it sounds. It\u2019s got to be comfortable to use, with every button, stick, and trigger easily in reach. It\u2019s also important that you\u2019re getting the features you want. For example, those might include easy setup on PC, good battery life, multi-platform compatibility, and accessibility options, like the ability to remap buttons and adjust stick or trigger sensitivity.\nAt Polygon, we play games on a lot of consoles and platforms \u2014 both new and old. Our staff has a wide variety of preferences and needs. We\u2019ve come together to share our favorite PC-ready controllers.\nMicrosoft Xbox controller\nOn the Polygon team, the Xbox controller got the highest number of endorsements of any controller. This speaks to its comfort and value, and that Microsoft has released enough colors to satisfy varying tastes in design. It also helps that it\u2019s usually around $50 (depending on the color), and that it just works with most PC games. Regardless of the Windows PC game client, there are no extra steps for setting it up.\nThis controller is a refined version of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One wireless model, with added texture around its grips, plus a capture button in the middle. It can, of course, connect to Xbox consoles, and to PCs that have Bluetooth. One universally positive change from the older version is that, if you want to connect via a cable for wired play, its connector port is the more ubiquitous USB-C instead of Micro USB. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack for private listening, though it can only be used if your controller is wired into your PC, not wirelessly.\n\u201cThe Xbox wireless controller just works for me \u2014 it fits right in my hands, the texture feels just right, and it\u2019s not too heavy\u201d \u2014Nicole Carpenter\nBeyond PC compatibility, the Xbox controller boasts native compatibility on Steam Deck, plus recent versions of Android and iOS. So, whether you have a phone or tablet, this controller can easily connect via Bluetooth. A growing number of mobile games support it, too, and it works like a charm with the Xbox Game Pass game streaming app.\nIt can work on even more platforms if you purchase 8BitDo\u2019s clever $19.99 USB Adapter 2. With it, you can use the Xbox controller on your Nintendo Switch. In addition to Switch support, this USB adapter lets you easily connect your Xbox controller to other devices, like Mac, Raspberry Pi, and more.\nThe biggest downside to the Xbox controller might not bother you: It requires two AA batteries, though on a positive note, the battery life is around the 40-hour range, depending on usage. If you don\u2019t want to change out batteries, we recommend this $44.99 8BitDo dual controller charging dock, which includes two rechargeable battery packs, enough for two controllers.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Xbox Elite Series 2 builds on the excellent foundation of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox controller with features that enthusiast gamers may appreciate. It features swappable stick caps and directional pads, adjustable tension for its analog sticks, and customizable back paddles. It also ships in a nice zip-up case. If you want more buttons and tweakable settings in a controller, this might be worth its $178.99 price. This model is compatible with Xbox and PC.\nIf you don\u2019t need all of the extra accessories that come with the Elite Series 2, Microsoft makes a cheaper Elite Series 2 Core. If you decide later on that you want the paddles, zip-up case, and swappable sticks, you can buy this third-party kit on Amazon for $22.99.\nSony DualSense controller\nThere\u2019s another slice of our staff who swear by Sony\u2019s DualSense, a modern controller that retains the symmetrical analog stick arrangement that PlayStation controllers are known for. Compared directly to the Xbox controller, the DualSense has similar levels of compatibility (both are compatible with Android and iOS, and feature built-in Bluetooth for support on PC). However, the DualSense does have key differences, as well as a few perks that help to justify its higher $69.99 price.\nIn terms of using the DualSense on a PC, it\u2019s possible to do, but it\u2019s a little complicated. It can connect via Bluetooth for a wireless connection, but games that don\u2019t support the DirectInput controller API likely won\u2019t recognize it as a controller. Plugging the controller into your PC might solve that issue, but there are other ways to get around this barrier if playing wirelessly is important to you.\nOne is to rely on Steam, which supports the DualSense controller with its SteamInput API. That makes Sony\u2019s controller a first-class citizen in the eyes of Steam, right next to the Xbox controller, and plenty of games should offer no-fuss DualSense support.\nIf you have PC games that you want to play on other services, like PC Game Pass, Epic Games Store, and more, you might experience some middling compatibility with the DualSense. However, adding them as a \u201cnon-Steam game\u201d within Steam can solve for this. To do this, click the \u201cAdd a Game\u201d option in the bottom left corner of the Steam client, then find the executable file (.exe) in your storage.\n\u201cI like the PS5 DualSense because it\u2019s incredibly precise \u2014 using it, after coming from previous gen controllers, felt like putting on glasses and seeing the world come into focus\u201d \u2014Nicole Clark\nTo get around using Steam entirely, you can download an app called DS4Windows along with some drivers, which ensures game compatibility on PC by emulating the DualSense as an Xbox controller. The app gives you a host of settings to customize the DualSense\u2019s button mapping, if you wish. And, in case you want to go down the rabbit hole of figuring out which PC games support the DualSense\u2019s haptics and adaptive trigger features (and the steps to getting them to work), the site PCGamingWiki has you covered.\nRelated Here are the best PS5 accessories\nThe DualSense is the official controller for the PS5. In games that support its features, it can have realistic-feeling haptic feedback and gyroscopic motion controls, and its triggers can provide tension to make certain actions feel more realistic. There\u2019s no better controller for the PS5 than this one. It\u2019s a good controller for using PS Remote Play, too. When it\u2019s connected to an Android device for a PS Remote Play session, the DualSense supports adaptive triggers in games that take advantage of the feature.\n8BitDo\u2019s $19.99 USB Adapter 2 also works perfectly with the DualSense, letting you play games on your Switch with it once it\u2019s paired. I preferred to play Splatoon 3 with my PS5 controller\u2019s analog stick arrangement. Heck, it even supports gyroscopic camera movement, just like the official Switch controllers.\nJust like Microsoft, Sony also has its own pro-grade controller. It\u2019s the $199.99 DualSense Edge, which is compatible with the PS5. It\u2019s tempting to call out its similarities to the Xbox Elite Series 2, of which there are plenty, but it\u2019s more helpful to speak about how it differs. For one, its stick modules can be replaced entirely \u2014 a move that makes the DualSense Edge a little more user-repairable. Also, the PS5\u2019s interface for the Edge is intuitive, and it makes remapping controls and setting schemes the breeze that it should be.\nWhile the Edge is compatible on PC, Sony and Steam haven\u2019t developed drivers that let gamers take full advantage of its back paddles and swappable control schemes.\nNintendo Switch Pro controller\nThe Switch Pro controller is another staff favorite. If it\u2019s a great Nintendo Switch and PC controller you\u2019re after, this is the pinnacle in terms of comfort, durability, battery life, and other Switch-specific extras, but we\u2019ll get to those a little later.\nThe Switch Pro controller can be used to play PC games. But like the DualSense, it\u2019s not a plug-and-play affair unless you literally plug it in via USB. To use it wirelessly, running Steam can help you out, as it officially supports the Switch Pro controller. Adding non-Steam games to your Steam library is a clever way to ensure compatibility for games that support controllers. Again, you can do that by clicking the \u201cAdd a Game\u201d option on the bottom left corner in the Steam client.\n\u201cThis is a very solid, unassuming but beautifully engineered pad, with Nintendo\u2019s typically great ergonomics and switchgear. The D-pad is one of the best out there, and those lovely, fat, responsive face buttons will give you SNES flashbacks in a good way\u201d \u2014Oli Welsh\nAlternatively, if you don\u2019t want to use Steam to play your games, relying on DS4Windows and its bevy of drivers is a free yet slightly advanced way to make Windows recognize your Switch Pro wireless controller. Of course, that $19.99 8BitDo USB Adapter 2 that I keep referencing can come in handy here, too. After plugging it into your PC and tethering wirelessly to it, you\u2019re good to go \u2014 no fussing with apps required.\nThe Switch Pro controller is, unsurprisingly, a fantastic Switch controller. Like the Joy-Cons, it supports motion controls, HD rumble for more subtle, accurate jolts of haptic feedback in games, and amiibo connectivity to redeem in-game perks in several games, including the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nThis might seem small, but it stands out as being one of a few wireless Switch controllers in existence that can wake the console remotely by holding down its home button. Many require you to manually turn on the console, which can be a minor annoyance.\n8BitDo Ultimate 2.4g controller\n8BitDo has released a lot of controllers in recent years, but the name for its Ultimate controller is fitting. It has many of the features from its best gamepads, plus some extras that should settle any sticker shock associated with its $49.99 price.\nFor starters, its asymmetrical analog stick layout, overall shape, and face button labels should feel right at home for people who love the shape of the Xbox controller. All of the buttons, triggers, and sticks feel just as good to use as any modern controller from a console manufacturer.\nLike several other 8BitDo controllers, this one can be thoroughly customized with its Ultimate software on mobile devices, or on PC. From there, you can remap controls, assign buttons to its two rear paddle buttons, tweak the actuation sensitivity of its triggers, and adjust stick settings. The controller allows up to three custom control schemes, which you can switch between with its middle \u201cstar\u201d button.\nThe Ultimate controller ships with a charging dock, and nesting inside of that dock is a 2.4 GHz transmitter that makes it fast and easy to connect to a PC. The dock makes for a convenient way to charge the controller, and you can switch between DirectInput and XInput by using a switch on its back, depending on the requirements of each PC game.\n8BitDo makes a pricier version of this controller with Nintendo-style face buttons called the Ultimate Bluetooth. They\u2019re virtually identical, and it can work via 2.4 GHz with PC, too. However, its biggest benefit is its Gulikit Hall effect analog sticks, which are resistant to developing drift over time by design. By comparison, the potentiometer-based sticks used in the Ultimate 2.4g (and all of the other controllers mentioned so far) bear no such guarantee. There\u2019s a possibility you may never experience the issue firsthand, but the anti-drifting sticks alone might be a reason for some to consider buying the Ultimate Bluetooth.\nThe Ultimate Bluetooth is similar in a lot of ways to Nintendo\u2019s Switch Pro controller, with its motion control support, rechargeable battery, and Nintendo-style face button layout. However, it doesn\u2019t have all of the same features. For instance, it doesn\u2019t support NFC, so you can\u2019t tap an amiibo on it, and its haptics aren\u2019t up to par with Nintendo\u2019s. However, it\u2019s one of a few third-party Switch controllers that can wake your console from sleep. If it\u2019s paired, press the home button, then shake the controller to awaken the Switch.\nUpdate (Nov. 17): Checked prices and links for accuracy.\n\nThis article, authored by Cameron Faulkner, was published by Polygon on 2023-11-17 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":236}
{"title":"5 things we learned so far about the Google antitrust case","context":"## 5 things we learned so far about the Google antitrust case\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai testified Monday in the U.S. government\u2019s antitrust trial against the company. The executive defended Google\u2019s business tactics, including its deal with Apple and other partners to make Google the default search engine.\nThe lawsuit stems from a 2020 antitrust claim over Google\u2019s dominance in the online search market. The claim is separate from one filed in January by the Department of Justice, along with eight states including New York, California and Colorado, that aims to \u201chalt Google\u2019s anticompetitive scheme, unwind Google\u2019s monopolistic grip on the market and restore competition to digital advertising.\u201d\nThe government has argued that Google uses its platforms and deals with partners to block out any competition in search or advertising, thus hindering competitors from accessing the data they\u2019d need to improve their products.\nGoogle argues that it\u2019s just doing business. Everybody wants Google as the default engine because it\u2019s the best. That doesn\u2019t make its actions illegal, the company says.\nMonday\u2019s trial hearing revealed plenty of juicy tidbits, including the $26.3 billion Google spent making itself the default search engine across platforms in 2021, how Google tried to take it further and have Chrome preinstalled on iPhones and more.\nGoogle paid $26 billion in 2021 to be everyone\u2019s default search engine\nWhen Google\u2019s search head Prabhakar Raghavan testified in court on October 28, he revealed that the tech giant had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 to multiple browsers, phones and platforms, from companies including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla, The Verge reports.\nAbout $18 billion of that total amount went directly to Apple, according to a New York Times report published earlier this month. Google has had its deal with Apple in place since 2003.\nWhen questioned on the amount of money Google spends to get first pick of search engines, Pichai said that the decision was made with the consumer in mind. Google pays big bucks to be everywhere so that it can take in all the data and be the best search engine across different companies\u2019 devices, said Pichai, according to The Verge.\nGoogle understood the value of defaults very early on. U.S. Justice Department lawyer Meagan Bellshaw showed Pichai a 2007 email from a Google product strategy meeting containing data showing that when people changed their browser homepage to Google, they did 15% more Google searches. When they switched away, their Google searches dropped 27%.\n\u201cNitin argues that focusing on homepage market share is one of the most effective things we can do to make gains in search market share,\u201d read an email that summarized the meeting and was sent to Pichai, as well as other Google leaders, according to The Verge.\nThe amount that Google spent on homepage market share has been a fixing point in the trial. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Microsoft and DuckDuckGo testified that their search engines would have been far more successful, even competitive with Google, had they been able to make similar deals with Apple. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even said he was willing to spend $15 billion per year to get Bing into Apple\u2019s default search, per The Information.\nGoogle agreed not to promote Chrome to Safari users\nAs part of its search deal with Apple, Google agreed not to promote Chrome to Safari users, reports Bloomberg. Google would have been able to do this with banners, pop-ups and other annoying means in other Google apps.\nThe agreement also meant that Apple never switched to a Google competitor or allowed users to choose their browser when setting up their iPhones.\nGoogle tried to be preinstalled on iPhones\nPichai admitted to attempting to get Tim Cook to preinstall Google on every iOS device back in 2018, according to The Verge. He hoped to make Google and Apple\u2019s services so connected as to be inseparable.\nThe way Pichai pitched it would have been a win-win for both companies. Google gets more people searching on its platform \u2014 not to mention all that juicy data \u2014 and Apple would get more revenue, as a result of the lucrative search agreement the two signed.\nFor whatever reason, Cook didn\u2019t take the bait. Apple doesn\u2019t preload third-party software onto its devices, and it wasn\u2019t going to make an exception for Google.\nGoogle\u2019s deleted chat logs\nDuring Pichai\u2019s testimony, the DOJ touched on Google\u2019s policy of deleting internal chat messages, despite being subject to a litigation hold. In February, the DOJ accused Google of systematically destroying chats through its history-off option, which deletes messages every 24 hours unless a user manually changed the setting.\nPichai said that he took action against the history-off default for chat in February to comply with the DOJ\u2019s litigation hold, according to CNBC.\nBellshaw pulled up a message exchange in 2021 where Pichai asked for history to be turned off in a group chat. Pichai responded that he wanted to discuss a personnel matter and the subject had nothing to do with the litigation hold, which he said he takes great care to comply with.\nA moment of nostalgia for Internet Explorer\nCast your memories back to 2005, when Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer became the default search engine. Back then, Google\u2019s legal chief David Drummond sent Microsoft an angry letter, saying that making Internet Explorer the search default was anticompetitive. Oh, how the tables have turned.\nAfter establishing that Google understands the inherent value of defaults, Bellshaw brought up Drummond\u2019s letter to establish the hypocrisy of Google today. The letter declared that problems with a default setting are made worse by how changes to defaults are handled, and that most end users \u201cdo not change defaults.\u201d\nThese are exactly the arguments that other search engine companies, like DuckDuckGo, Brave or Microsoft\u2019s Bing, make when they accuse Google of being anticompetitive by making deals with Apple and others. The DOJ doubled down on this, saying Google has become the monopoly it denounced years ago.\nWhat does it all mean?\nThe case is expected to continue for several weeks, bringing to a head one of the biggest fights in tech antitrust since the U.S. took Microsoft to trial in the 1990s.\nIf the judge rules against Google, the outcome could look a lot like the Microsoft deal, in which the computer company was required to change its behavior and share its APIs with third-party developers. Microsoft was also banned from making anticompetitive and exclusive deals with computer manufacturers.\nGoogle might end up having to turn over all or most of the data it has collected to other search engines so they can improve their products and attract more users. The DOJ has said that Google gets 16 times more data than Bing does everyday.\nThe Google outcome could also have a ripple effect on other Big Tech cases. The FTC sued Amazon in September for using anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power. The DOJ has been investigating Apple for years over the company\u2019s policy for third-party apps on its devices and whether it unfairly favors its own products. There\u2019s an ongoing case between the FTC and Facebook, wherein the agency calls on Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.\nEnforcers will want to show that antitrust law is still relevant and can successfully take on the biggest, most powerful companies in the world.\n\nThis article, authored by Rebecca Bellan, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-31 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":237}
{"title":"We could end the AIDS epidemic in less than a decade. Here's how.","context":"## We could end the AIDS epidemic in less than a decade. Here's how.\n\nCountries have teamed up through a United Nations program to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Can it be done?\nAn HIV diagnosis hasn't been a death sentence for years, thanks to powerful medications.\nDespite incredible progress, however, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) remains a global public health threat, with 1.3 million new infections and around half that many deaths in 2022 alone.\nWhile new HIV infections have dropped steadily since their peak in 1995 , as people live longer with the disease, the pool of people who are HIV-positive has only grown. People with HIV must consistently take medications to prevent the virus from becoming transmissible again or progressing to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). As a result, new infections could actually rebound fast if the world doesn't dramatically ramp up the number of people being regularly treated, tested and protected from new HIV infections.\nBut we could head off that rebound risk by the end of the decade, experts say.\nCountries around the world have signed onto an ambitious United Nations program with a goal to \"reduce the rate of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths to below the reproductive rate of 1,\" country by country, Quarraisha Abdool Karim , associate scientific director of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa and a joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS (UNAIDS) special ambassador, told Live Science. That would mean each person living with HIV would infect fewer than one additional person in their lifetime.\nIf the program is successful, we'd see 200,000 new HIV infections and 130,000 AIDS-related deaths worldwide in 2030 \u2014 90% fewer than in 2010 . While eradicating the virus would require a vaccine and cure, we could eventually drive HIV infections and death rates to near zero without those tools, Abdool Karim said.\n\"We do have the tools to end AIDS as a public health threat. We do have the biomedical interventions,\" she said. \"The challenge is, how do we all get to that point?\"\nRelated: Could CRISPR cure HIV someday?\nMedicines known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) suppress the amount of HIV in a person's blood until it's undetectable. (Image credit: The Times \/ Contributor via Getty Images)\nFrom the first treatment to ending AIDS\nThe first, imperfect HIV treatment , AZT (azidothymidine), was approved in 1987. Nearly four decades and more than 40 million AIDS-related deaths later, we're still hunting for a vaccine and a cure for HIV, but our treatments have dramatically improved.\n\"We've had really powerful treatments, really, since 1996, but they just get better all the time,\" Dr. Monica Gandhi , director of the University of California, San Francisco Center for AIDS Research and medical director of the HIV Clinic at San Francisco General Hospital, told Live Science.\nToday's standard treatment, combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), uses several drugs to disrupt HIV's ability to replicate and invade immune cells. Given as daily pills or monthly or bimonthly injections , ART slashes the amount of HIV in a person's blood until it's undetectable. If maintained, \"viral suppression\" extends a person's life span to about that of HIV-negative people and eliminates their chance of spreading HIV via sex .\n\"People living with HIV, on treatment and undetectable, are not infectious \u2014 full stop, end of statement \u2014 to their sexual partners,\" Dr. Raphael Landovitz , co-director of UCLA's Center for HIV Identification, Prevention, and Treatment Services, told Live Science. Viral suppression also nearly eliminates HIV spread to babies during pregnancy or childbirth , greatly reduces spread via breastfeeding and likely lowers spread from sharing syringes.\nWe also have powerful medicines that prevent HIV-negative people from contracting the virus if exposed. Known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), these drugs are available as daily pills. There's also an injectable drug called cabotegravir (brand name Apretude) that's given bimonthly. Some African countries have also licensed a vaginal ring for HIV prevention ; it's less effective than PrEP pills but works for a full month. And condom use and voluntary male circumcision also cut transmission.\nBy 2014, there was strong consensus that the drugs we had could end the AIDS epidemic. But those drugs weren't being rolled out fast enough to head off rebounds in infection, UNAIDS cautioned. At that time, models predicted that if treatment and prevention services didn't reach more people over time, the number of people with HIV would balloon to 41.5 million by 2030. To prevent this, UNAIDS set forth ambitious targets to scale up the global HIV response. Hitting these targets would prevent 28 million new HIV infections and at least 21 million AIDS-related deaths between 2015 and 2030, they projected.\nOne major goal, the \"95-95-95\" target, is set for 2025. Achieving it would mean 95% of people with HIV know their status, 95% of those diagnosed take HIV drugs, and 95% of those treated are \"virally suppressed,\" meaning the drugs keep them from spreading the infection via sex. This translates to around 86% of people with HIV being virally suppressed.\nOther 2025 targets aim to ensure that 95% of people at risk of HIV have access to prevention and that PrEP be made available to at least 10 million at-risk people.\nSo far, we're not on target: In 2022, only 76% of the total 39 million people with HIV worldwide were taking ART, and 71% were virally suppressed, according to the latest UNAIDS report .\nSo what can we do to reach 95% across the board?\nRelated: How are people cured of HIV? Here's everything you need to know\n(Image credit: Future)\nVulnerable populations\nA big hurdle to ending the AIDS epidemic is getting treatments to vulnerable populations, including children. In 2022, only 57% of the 1.5 million children under 15 with HIV received treatment, 46% were virally suppressed and an estimated 84,000 died of AIDS-related illnesses.\nThat's partly because kids aren't typically included in initial clinical trials for treatments, so there are relatively few child-friendly formulas, Abdool Karim said. The preferred treatment for children, a tablet that dissolves in water , was just approved in 2021 and has been adopted only recently in many countries . However, most other HIV drugs for kids taste bad, are difficult to swallow or must be taken several times a day, UNAIDS notes , so improving these formulations could make their HIV regimens easier to maintain.\nLong-acting ART options \u2014 meaning those that don't require daily pills \u2014 are nonexistent for children under 12, Gandhi said. To help make long-acting ART suitable for young children, the National Institutes of Health is supporting research into how to best adapt drugs approved for adults, she noted. But that grant opens in 2024, so it's unclear if it could make a dent before 2030.\nAnd even if better drugs are widely available, \"children are not going to be able to access antiretroviral therapy in a vacuum,\" said Dr. Anjali Sharma , a professor of medicine who now studies complications of HIV at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and has studied ART adherence in different settings.\n\"The pediatric care really has to be integrated with other services, potentially the mom's treatment or things that are going to work with the family as a unit,\" she said.\nRelated: Kids under 5 with HIV are dying at high rates. Here's why.\nThe science is a first step, but access is what will translate its true potential and value. Quarraisha Abdool Karim, CAPRISA\nHitting the 95-95-95 target will also require better reaching teen girls and young women, especially with prevention and testing. Nearly 1 in 6 new HIV cases in 2022 were in girls and women ages 15 to 24, many of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa.\nOnce diagnosed and started on ART, women's viral suppression rates are \"high and so are survival benefits,\" Abdool Karim said. Among all diagnosed women over 15, 82% had access to ART and 76% were virally suppressed in 2022. But starting ART first requires being tested for HIV, and testing rates remain low in hard-hit regions, particularly among teens .\nMany of the hardest-hit regions lack prevention programs for young women, and the few existing programs often miss girls who are not in school. Girls facing a lack of education, poverty and food insecurity have an especially high risk of HIV, as do girls with older male partners. Intimate-partner violence and sexual coercion often mean they cannot control when they are exposed to HIV. Plus, in some countries, HIV services require parental consent, which can also reduce girls' access to prevention and treatment.\nImproving girls' access to discreet prevention services as well as sex education \u2014 both in and out of school \u2014 will be key to reducing their HIV rates. Cabotegravir, which is \"stunningly effective against vaginal acquisition of HIV,\" could be a powerful tool for HIV prevention in women, Landovitz said.\nRepresentatives of HIV organizations march along Whitehall in London, England on March 18, 2023, calling for an end to the stigma that still surrounds HIV. (Image credit: Mark Kerrison \/ Contributor viaGetty Images)\nOther populations that are far from the targets include transgender people with HIV, an estimated 44% of whom are on ART, and HIV-positive men who have sex with men, who have 78% ART coverage. In addition, just 65% of HIV-positive sex workers and 69% of HIV-positive people who inject drugs take ART. Compared with the general adult population, these groups have far higher HIV prevalence, ranging from fourfold greater among sex workers to 14-fold greater among transgender people.\nAnd those numbers could be an undercount, as many countries don't track these populations. Punitive laws, police harassment, harsh stigma and social taboos keep many people out of HIV care, while high rates of incarceration and sexual violence also raise their risk of acquiring HIV. Lifting discriminatory policies and weaving HIV care into trusted, community-based programs will be key to reaching these demographics.\nRelated: Patient's immune system 'naturally' cures HIV in the second case of its kind\nCost barriers\nThe tools to end the epidemic by 2030 will work, but only if they get to the people who need them. \"The science is a first step, but access is what will translate its true potential and value,\" Abdool Karim told Live Science.\nFor instance, the number of people taking PrEP pills rose more than tenfold from 2019 to 2022. But cabotegravir, a potential game changer, is not yet widely used due to its high cost \u2014 $3,700 per dose in the U.S. The drug's nonprofit price will be around $30 a dose, the drug's maker recently told the South African news outlet Bhekisisa , and generic versions will be manufactured in coming years . But the current high price means HIV programs have yet to fold cabotegravir into their budgets, Landovitz said.\n\"There's still not a drop of cabotegravir to be had anywhere in Africa,\" where some of the highest rates of new HIV infections occur, Abdool Karim said.\nAnd regardless of the type of ART they take, a patient should have their viral load checked regularly . In 2022, 21 million people underwent routine viral-load testing, up from 6 million in 2015. Viral-load tests are expensive, though, so proxy measures \u2014 such as a urine test Gandhi and colleagues designed to track ART levels \u2014 could help fulfill the same purpose cheaply.\nIn addition, an estimated 25% of people stop ART treatment, sometimes for six months or more, often because they face stigma, can't get to the clinic or can't afford treatment. These individuals, many of whom come from vulnerable populations, represent a growing proportion of the AIDS cases seen in hospitals.\n\"That is preventable and avoidable and really represents a failure on many levels,\" Sharma told Live Science. \"But the failure isn't really the drug itself.\" It's a failure of the support system that could keep people on ART, she said.\nRelated: HIV may hide out in brain cells, ready to infect other organs\nSuccess stories and further work\nDespite the hurdles, some countries are well on their way to meeting UNAIDS' goals. Botswana, Eswatini, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe have already hit the 95-95-95 target set for 2025, and an additional 16 countries are close to reaching these milestones.\nThe U.S. trails behind. In 2021, 75% of the people diagnosed in the country received \"some HIV care,\" and 66% were virally suppressed. Men who have sex with men made up the highest proportion of new infections in the U.S., with Black, Hispanic and Latino populations predominantly affected.\nCountries that have hit the 95-95-95 targets offer universal, free ART access, Landovitz noted, while the U.S. government only has programs to help cover uninsured people's HIV treatment . Racism, homophobia and transphobia often keep people from getting care, he said. And especially in urban centers, people dealing with housing insecurity, substance use and mental health issues struggle to access ART consistently , Gandhi said.\nEastern Europe and Central Asia also lag far behind, with just 51% of people with HIV getting ART and less than half being virally suppressed.\nRelated: Oldest 'nearly complete' HIV genome found in forgotten tissue sample from 1966\nBeyond 2030\nWe face many obstacles on the road to ending the AIDS epidemic \u2014 but we do hold all of the tools to get there, Abdool Karim, Sharma, Gandhi and Landovitz agreed. By using those tools effectively, we could begin to meaningfully drive the number of new HIV infections toward zero. At that point, HIV would become a manageable, chronic disease of the elderly.\nAlready, about a quarter of people with HIV worldwide, and about half of adults with HIV in Western and Central Europe and North America, are at least 50 years old. \"They're growing older with HIV; they're not dying from HIV or AIDS,\" said Sharma, whose research focuses on aging populations with HIV.\nBut that doesn't mean the quest for an HIV vaccine or cure is any less important, even if neither is likely to materialize in the next seven years, Abdool Karim said.\n\"We need to continue our investments to find a vaccine, to find a cure,\" she told Live Science. \"Because that will then say, 'That's it.'\"\n\nThis article was published by Live Science: The Most Interesting Articles on 2023-12-01 under the category 'science'.\n\n","id":238}
{"title":"Merck, Novo Nordisk, Gilead, Biogen and more: Here are the investment opportunities in global Big Pharma","context":"## Merck, Novo Nordisk, Gilead, Biogen and more: Here are the investment opportunities in global Big Pharma\n\nThe US is the largest pharmaceutical market in the world. By virtue of its size, its ideal IP protection laws, and deep-pocketed insurers, most of the cutting-edge innovation in pharma tends to be concentrated here. For investors and general readers alike, one should be abreast of the latest pharmaceutical innovation taking place overseas. Will a weight loss pill be a reality? When will HIV be cured? What is the future of cancer treatments?\nIndian investors can access growth in manufacturing, banking, commodity, services or even IT in Indian markets; but for cutting-edge tech and pharmaceutical exposure, the US is the place to look to.\nHere, we highlight the largest unmet needs in medicine currently being addressed by US Big Pharma, such as Merck, Gilead, Eli Lilly, and also by big players based in Europe \u2014 Novo Nordisk and Roche.\nWe also lay down the basic framework for investing in or assessing US pharma and the stocks that are in focus currently.\nOncology\nFrom plain chemotherapy, to surgery, to radiation and now immunotherapy, cancer treatment has come a long way. Immunotherapy, as the name suggests, is a pharmaceutical way of using the body\u2019s immune system to eradicate cancer cells.\nPembrolizumab (Keytruda) approved in 2014 is the first major Monoclonal anti body or mAB from Merck. The product has raked in approvals for several cancers and has generated $20 billion in sales in 2022. This works by helping T-cells find and attack cancer cells. The PD-1 protein on T-cells is deactivated by PD-L1 protein found on the surface of a cancerous cell. Keytruda and Opdivo (from Bristol-Myers Squibb) that target PD-1 and Tecentriq (a PD-L1 inhibitor by Roche) can stop T-cells from switching off \u2014 by blocking the PD-1\/PD-L1 interaction between a cancer cell and a T-cell. This allows for normal immune action on cancer cells.\nHowever, mABs have not had a high success rate. Treatment-resistant patient cohorts to mABs stood considerably high at 70-80 per cent.\nCombining the chemo route of toxicity and mABs\u2019 targeted actions on cancer cells are Antibody Drug Conjugates or ADCs. These rely on an mAB to target cancer cells and then release the cytotoxin into the cancer cells. The link to join the mAB and the toxin makes ADCs a three-part drug.\nThe three parts involved in this process, along with the fact that several mABs are available, have opened the ADC market. Compared to mABs, ADC market is dominated by smaller players. Gilead acquired Immunomedics for $20 billion for its leading ADC - Trodelvy; Roche\u2019s leading drug trastuzumab (Herceptin) for breast cancer is now paired with a cytotoxin and branded as Kadcyla, which is expected to generate peak sales of $3-4 billion over the next two years. Merck paid $4 billion in upfront payments to Daiichi Sankyo to collaborate on ADC. The US FDA has approved 10 ADCs for cancer treatment, and more than 80 ADCs are under clinical trials.\nAnother route of targeting cancer cells is CAR-T therapies. From the blood drawn from the patient, T-cells are isolated and collected. Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which can affect cancer cells, are then induced in these T-cells. This is done by infecting them with a nullified virus that is engineered to generate CARs. Such cells are cultured to multiply and then reinfused into the patient\u2019s blood stream. For instance, leukemia and lymphoma cancers have CD-19 markers, which are targeted by the CAR-T cells and then they do their job of destroying the cancer cells. This segment has also witnessed significant M&A with Celgene acquiring Juno Therapeutics for $9 billion and Gilead acquiring Kite Pharma for $12 billion.\nThese novel approaches may also address the shortcomings in hematological cancers (blood) which have not faced as much success as in solid cancers.\nDiabetes\nAntidiabetic treatment kicked off with the discovery of the first animal-made insulin around a century ago. From there, innovation brought forth insulin synthesised from humans, synthetic insulins, longer and shorter acting insulins.\nApart from pills and the ever-reliable metformin, three leading categories operate in anti-diabetes. There are Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV inhibitors (DPP-IVs Januvia\/Janumet), Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2s Jardiance, Farxiga) and Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs Trulicity, Victoza, Ozempic).\nGLP-1RA is inching over the other categories with improved glycemic control in clinical trials. With positive impact on non-glycemic aspects as well including weight loss, cardiac events and kidney functions, GLPs will witness more product innovation and R&D commitment in the short term.\nGLP-1 is a normal peptide released by the intestine in response to a meal. This binds to GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas and activates insulin production, which is impaired in Type-2 diabetes patients. GLP-1 receptor agonists are external agents that bind to the GLP-1 receptors and elevate insulin secretion by the pancreas. But, GLP-1 receptors are also found in kidney, lung, heart, skin, immune cells, and several other tissues. This allows GLP-1RA to attain a multi-modal result, which improves cardiac and renal outcomes, and aids weight loss slower gastric emptying by binding to intestinal receptors. This feature separates GLP-1RA from other modes.\nTreatment regimens are now not just restricted to glycemic control. Novo Nordisk\u2019s Semaglutide, a leading GLP-1RA regimen, has shown in studies that it can reduce an adverse cardiovascular event by 20 per cent in overweight patients. In Type-2 diabetes patients, Sema\u2019s study to show improved outcomes in chronic kidney disease was successful even on interim analysis.\nSemaglutide, branded as Wegovy, showed a 17-18 per cent weight loss sustained over 68 weeks\u2019 trial for obese patients treated with Wegovy. This has created a flutter as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and others have joined the race in the category.\nConvenience is another important dimension on which anti-diabetes treatments place a significant weight. Once-a week insulin, Ozempic, has been approved and once-a-week long-acting basal analogue is in the works. With frequent insulin injections being a primary complaint in diabetes treatment regimen, Novo Nordisk has also launched a pill version of its GLP-1RA, Rybelsus.\nHIV\nFrom being a near-fatal prognosis, HIV is now a chronic condition with near-normal life expectancy. The first antiretroviral therapy (ART) started with azidothymidine in the late 90s, which belongs to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class of medications. The current regimen is a combination of NRTIs, nonnucleoside NRTIs (NNRTI), protease and integrase inhibitors and casts a heavy pill burden, apart from side effects. ART therapy is focused on limiting viral replication at several levels of cell development. NNRTI and NRTI act at the cellular level, protease inhibitors work at the maturation phase, integrase inhibitors at the integration phase of the viral lifecycle.\nTruvada is the first approved PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) treatment for those at risk of viral exposure. These work at very early stage of viral exposure and have found high success when taken regularly in the pill form.\nHowever, treatment resistance to ARTs from prior exposure is an increasing concern in HIV patients. Gilead\u2019s Lenacapavir, approved last year, is a single-pill treatment regimen for patients with multi-drug resistance to ART regimen. This formulation also addresses the pill burden with a single pill.\nThat said, by limiting viral replication, ARTs, by design, cannot cure or lead to remission of HIV. There is hope, though. By pinpointing a cohort of patients whose viral load was under control with limited treatment, researchers have identified broadly neutralising antibodies or bNAbs as a potential cure for HIV. Antibodies deal with viruses but fail to do so in HIV infection. By engineering bNAbs in a manner similar to mABs for cancer or vaccines (where antibody reaction to neutered virus generates immune protection), HIV cure may be on the horizon.\nGilead\u2019s several Phase-2 programmes with ART combination are in progress. Studies as recently as February 2023 presented proof of concept \u2014 90 per cent participants showed virological suppression at 26 weeks. Incidentally, Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi and Harvoni were the first cures for Hepatitis C. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to eradicate the virus by 2030.\nAlzheimer\u2019s\nThe degenerative disease of the brain has proved to be a difficult challenge for pharmaceutical companies. Leqembi (lecanemab), developed by Eisai in collaboration with Biogen, was the first and only approved drug for Alzheimer\u2019s in July 2023. This comes after several failed attempts, and one controversial false start in the recent years.\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is characterised by amyloid beta deposits on brain cells leading to shrinking and loss of cognitive abilities. Despite a clear marker of amyloid plaques and a target area to work on, pharma companies failed to address plaque removal or a statistical improvement in cognitive functioning after plaque removal, till the recent approval. Pfizer, Eli lilly, Merck and many others faced failure in the space. The amyloid theory itself was in question.\nBiogen\u2019s adacanumab had a peculiar start. The company itself stopped development in 2019, but it surprisingly pursued a high-dose study into 2021. Later, FDA approved adacanumab with an accelerated approval for high-dose version, which faced sharp criticism. Three advisers resigned over the approval of the drug that could have cost $56,000 per annum to administer. However, with a \u201ctraditional\u201d approval for Eisai-partnered lecanemab for Alzheimer\u2019s (compared to accelerated approval for adacanumab), Biogen has the first approved treatment, putting adacanumab on the backburner.\nCognitive function improvement is a critical marker for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment and lecanemab delivers lower degeneration compared to placebo on this count. The treatment reduced clinical decline by 27 per cent at 18 months on clinical dementia scoring and on daily living scale delivered a 37 per cent improvement compared to placebo. As is evident, the development is satisfactory but a lot more progress is left to be made on Alzheimer\u2019s treatment curve.\nTakeaways for Investors\nAnalysing pharma stocks in the US rests on three factors: drugs about to expire, drugs in ramping up stage and the pipeline. With sharp fall post genericisation, drugs about to expire will be a major overhang for any company, without a portfolio in ramping up stages. Pipeline products cannot really offset absence of products in ramp-up stage, as pipeline assets are given lower probabilities of success. Generally, Phase-I\/II\/III assets get 10\/20\/50 per cent probability of success.\nSo a good pharma stock should have low impact from expiries and fairly distributed pipeline. Along such lines, we earlier recommended Novo Nordisk (+140 per cent since July-21) and Abbvie (+27 per cent since Oct-21). We reiterate the recommendation on two stocks which are now trading at 31 times and 12 times FY24 earnings.\nNovo Nordisk, with sales ramp-up in weight loss, pill format and weekly injections of GLP-1RA, is well poised to grow even now. The pipeline will address NASH (untreated liver disease), hematology and other non-diabetic areas as well.\nAbbvie, despite Humira\u2019s patent loss by end 2023 ($22 revenue billion in 2022) will continue to be powered by Rinvoq and Skyrizi in autoimmune, apart from deep pipeline assets. The Allergan acquisition, funded out of the cash flows from Humira as a replacement for Humira, can cushion the patent loss to an extent.\nAnalyst focus for Merck (12 times FY24 EPS) will start shifting to Keytruda\u2019s likely patent loss in 2028. Despite the overhang, investors can accumulate the stock on dips. The deep pipeline powered by Keytruda combinations in immunology, ADC and other cancers, and the balance sheet strength should support Merck\u2019s stock. While biosimilar launches will impact Keytruda\u2019s sales in 2028, the rate of decline may be lower owing to strong physician preference for Keytruda.\nAnother important aspect to consider is the pipeline valuation. Here\u2019s an example of how it is done. For instance, Biogen (and Eisai\u2019s) Leqembi for Alzheimer\u2019s (AD) is expected to generate peak sales of $7 billion by 2030. It has announced a list price of $26,500 for annual course and we assumed 50 per cent rebate to insurers on average here. Considering the 6 million patients in AD in the US, assuming 50 per cent are mild to moderate (applicable group according to FDA label) and 15 per cent on treatment by year 7, the drug alone can rake in $12 billion (halved to account for Eisai\u2019s share) by 2030 in cumulative sales for a company whose market cap is $33 billion trading at 14 times FY24 EPS.\n\nThis article was published by Business Line on 2023-11-18 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":239}
