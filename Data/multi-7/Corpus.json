Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nJada Pinkett Smith has revealed why she and her husband Will Smith never signed a prenuptial agreement before getting married.\nThe former talk show host, 52, spoke candidly about her husband during a recent interview with Parade. While discussing her new memoir, Worthy, Jada revealed that she and Will didn\u2019t sign a prenup when they were married in 1997 because they knew divorce wasn\u2019t in the cards for them.\n\u201cListen, weddings are beautiful, but they can be very romanticised,\u201d Jada said. \u201cI feel that was a very real moment for the two of us to look each other in the eyes, recognise that there would be tough times in this journey and to say to each other: \u2018No matter what, we\u2019re going to figure it out and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t need a prenup, because I\u2019m making a promise that divorce won\u2019t be necessary, that we will figure this out.\u2019\u201d\nThe Girls Trip star explained how she and Will casually promised not to get a divorce, and how that decision impacted their perspective on on marriage.\n\u201cAnd we made that promise to each other without all of the bridal wedding beauty; it was just sitting on a log in his mother\u2019s backyard, and going: \u2018Hey\u2019 - having to really look at the possibility of us not being together,\u201d she said.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Jada has opened up about her long-term commitment to her husband. During an interview with Hoda Kotb for Today, which aired on 13 October, the actor confirmed that she and her partner have been living \u201ccompletely separate lives\u201d for the past seven years. However, according to Jada, their choice to live in separate homes doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll be getting divorced anytime soon.\n\u201cI made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will work through whatever. And I just haven\u2019t been able to break that promise.\u201d\nWhen asked why she and Will didn\u2019t \u201cjust amicably divorce,\u201d Jada simply replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nShe then explained how her family shaped that decision, as she and the King Richard star share two children - Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22. Will also has a 30-year-old son, Trey, who he shares with ex-wife Sheree Zampino. \u201cWe love our family and we love each other. It\u2019s more of a life partnership,\" Jada explained. \"Now, 10 years from now, Hoda, who knows?\u201d\nDuring a 2018 episode of her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, Jada doubled down on her stance about divorce, as she recalled the the hard conversation she had with Will about the topic before they got married.\n(Getty Images)\n\u201cI told Will from the gate, I said let me tell you something: \u2018If you marry me, know this: we\u2019re gonna be together. We\u2019re going to be under the same roof,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cFor me personally, I\u2019m not mature enough to have a divorce, I\u2019m just not. I don\u2019t think I would ever be mature enough, I don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star has also shared similar sentiments, as he said during an appearance on the Ellen Degeneres Show that \u201cdivorce just can\u2019t be an option\u201d for him and Jada. \u201cIt\u2019s really that simple. And I think that\u2019s the problem with LA - there are so many options. So a huge part of the success for [Jada] and I is that we just removed the other options.\u201d\nLast week, Jada made headlines when she revealed that at the time of the 2022 Academy Awards, when Will slapped Chris Rock, she and her husband had been separated for six years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,\u201d she said during an interview with People. \u201cWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.\u201d\nJada then praised her children for how they\u2019ve helped her grow, adding: \u201cMy children, they\u2019re little gurus. They\u2019ve taught me a deep sense of self-acceptance.\u201d\nOn 16 October, Will broke his silence on his wife\u2019s comments during an interview with the New York Times. The outlet noted that he said his partner\u2019s memoir \u201ckind of woke him up\u201d and that he has now realised she is more \u201cresilient, clever and compassionate than he\u2019d understood\u201d.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been with someone for more than half of your life, a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties,\u201d Will added.\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-16 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":360}
{"title":"Europe\u2019s artists and labels could lose $137m annually to US recorded music rightsholders if EU law isn\u2019t changed, trade groups warn","context":"## Europe\u2019s artists and labels could lose $137m annually to US recorded music rightsholders if EU law isn\u2019t changed, trade groups warn\n\nA group of organizations that represent musical artists in Europe has warned that an \u201canomaly\u201d in EU law could soon result in artists losing up to 40% of the income they make from terrestrial radio broadcasts and other public performances of their music.\nBecause of a technicality in the EU\u2019s law, that lost income would largely go to US-based artists, stated the artists\u2019 groups, which include IMPALA, the trade association for European indie labels, and Adami, the French collective management organization for performers\u2019 rights.\nAt the heart of the issue is a difference in how the US and the EU pay artists for terrestrial (non-satellite) radio broadcasts of music and recorded music played in bars and restaurants.\nIn Europe, when recorded music is played over terrestrial radio or in venues, performance rights payments must be made to the artists and labels behind the recording, as well as to the songwriters and publishers who own the composition behind the recording. However, in the US, performance rights payments are made only to the songwriters and publishers, and not to artists and labels.\nAs a result, European countries largely followed the \u201creciprocity principle\u201d that has been written into international copyright treaties such as the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996: In those countries where artists and labels are paid performance rights, there was no obligation to pay US artists and labels, since European artists didn\u2019t receive those payments from airplay in the US.\nHowever, in 2020 the European Court of Justice (CJEU) ruled that the \u201creciprocity\u201d principle no longer applies to EU member states, even if it exists in copyright treaties and national laws.\nThe court ruled that the European Union\u2019s Rental\/Lending Directive of 2006 doesn\u2019t allow EU member states to withhold payments to nationals of non-EU countries.\nWhat the failure of the \u201creciprocity\u201d principle means in practice: US-based artists whose recordings are played on the radio in the EU will be able to collect performance royalties, while EU artists will continue to get nothing from their recordings being played in the US.\nBecause royalties are paid from a collective pool of income, this will reduce payments to European artists by as much as 40% in some countries, the artists\u2019 groups said, as that is the share of US music played on the radio in those countries.\nIMPALA estimates that the annual loss to EU recorded music rightsholders as a result of \u201creciprocity\u201d protections not applying in Europe would amount to approximately \u20ac125 million (USD $137m) \u2013 money which would instead be handed to their US counterparts.\n\u201cUnless this error is fixed, EU member states will not be able to continue applying the longstanding principle of material reciprocity in the payment of broadcast and public performance royalties on sound recordings from non-EU countries,\u201d the artists\u2019 groups said in a statement issued on Tuesday (November 28).\nThe reciprocity principle \u201chas proven vital in raising the level of copyright protection across the globe for decades,\u201d the statement added.\n\u201dA devastating transfer of over \u20ac125 million [USD $137 million] every year out of Europe is on the horizon,\u201d IMPALA Executive Chair Helen Smith said this past March.\n\u201cWe have been calling on the European Commission to address this since the ruling came out in September 2020, but despite some initial positive signs last year the silence in recent months has been deafening.\u201d\n\u201cWe call on the EU to act and also exert increased trade pressure on the USA to raise their level of [copyright] protection. Their stance is costing the world music economy hundreds of millions a year.\u201d Helen Smith, IMPALA\nIn its 2020 ruling, the CJEU made it clear that the EU legislature has the power to change this by rewriting the directive governing copyright payments.\n\u201cIt is for the EU legislature alone, which has exclusive external competence in the matter, to decide on such a limitation,\u201d the court stated following the ruling.\nThe artists\u2019 groups noted in their statement on Tuesday that the European Commission \u201chas on several occasions acknowledged concerns about the impact of the ruling and made clear its intention to find a balanced solution. But a solution has yet to be proposed.\u201d\n\u201cIt is the EU\u2019s responsibility to prevent European artists and producers losing millions every year to the USA, which has chosen not to protect these rights. A proposal is needed now to restore legal certainty, safeguard cultural diversity and European sovereignty,\u201d Smith said in the statement.\n\u201cWe are seeing a clear and substantial drop in the revenue going to Dutch and other European performers and producers.\u201d Will Maas, Ntb\/Kunstenbond\n\u201cWe call on the EU to act and also exert increased trade pressure on the USA to raise their level of [copyright] protection. Their stance is costing the world music economy hundreds of millions a year.\u201d\nIn the Netherlands, the first EU country to stop applying the reciprocity principle, \u201cwe are seeing a clear and substantial drop in the revenue going to Dutch and other European performers and producers,\u201d said Will Maas, chairman of the Dutch musicians\u2019 union Ntb\/Kunstenbond.\n\u201cThis is what awaits other countries if nothing is done to address this.\u201d\nAlong with IMPALA, Adami and Ntb\/Kunstenbond, other groups that signed on to the statement include the Swedish musicians\u2019 union Musikerf\u00f6rbundet, Belgian collective management society PlayRight, the Swedish Artists\u2019 and Musicians\u2019 Interest Organisation (SAMI), the Swedish Union of Professional Musicians (SYMF) and unisono, the German Federation of Musicians.\nThe US Congress extended copyright protections to sound recordings in 1971, but those copyright protections didn\u2019t include a public performance right that would have ensured royalty payments to artists, producers and labels.\nIn 1995, Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act, which did include performance rights, but limited those rights to performances made \u201cby means of a digital audio transmission,\u201d which doesn\u2019t include terrestrial radio.\nAs a result, the US \u201cis the only significant music economy in the world that does not have these full rights in their domestic legislation,\u201d the artists\u2019 groups said.Music Business Worldwide\n\nThis article, authored by Daniel Tencer, was published by Music Business Worldwide on 2023-11-29 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":361}
{"title":"Why is Brock Purdy called Mr. Irrelevant? Story behind 49ers QB's nickname explained","context":"## Why is Brock Purdy called Mr. Irrelevant? Story behind 49ers QB's nickname explained\n\nSan Francisco 49ers franchise QB Brock Purdy is arguably the best quarterback in the 2022 NFL Draft class. The 2022 Mr. Irrelevant has had a dream start to his NFL career, remaining unbeaten and being one of the better young shot callers in the league. But why is Purdy known as \"Mr. Irrelevant\" if he was pivotal for the 49ers?\nWell, Mr. Irrelevant is the nickname given to the final pick of the NFL Draft. The Mr. Irrelevant title has been a staple of NFL Drafts since the 1976 Draft.\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\nGrading Brock Purdy's draft class: How many QBs have done better than the 49ers QB so far?\nEight quarterbacks were selected before Purdy in the 2023 NFL Draft. Their names are Kenny Pickett (Pittsburgh Steelers), Desmond Ridder (Atlanta Falcons), Malik Willis (Tennessee Titans), Matt Corral (Carolina Panthers), Bailey Zappe (New England Patriots), Sam Howell (Washington Commanders), Chris Oladokun (Pittsburgh Steelers) and Skylar Thompson (Miami Dolphins). As you can tell, the \"Mr. Irrelevant\" of this Draft has had, by far, the best NFL career so far from the bunch.\nWhich way should Giants next year? Fire up our 2024 NFL Draft Simulator to get NY back in contention\nThe 2022 NFL Draft's Mr. Irrelevant is the franchise QB of one of the best teams in the NFL, the San Francisco 49ers. Since breaking into the starting lineup, Purdy has made a mockery of his \"Mr. Irrelevant\" tag. The Iowa State University alum was the first Mr. Irrelevant to make a forward pass in a regular season game successfully, and it has been up from there.\nPurdy finished his rookie season with five consecutive regular-season victories, completing a 10-game winning streak by San Francisco to close the season. He carried on his regular season form to the postseason, leading the 49ers to an NFC Championship Game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Unfortunately, Purdy got hurt in the game, as the 49ers fell just short of a Super Bowl LVII appearance.\nSo far, Purdy has started the 2023 NFL season where he left off, opening the season with a 5-0 record. The San Francisco 49ers are the only franchise currently unbeaten in 2023 alongside their NFC foes, the Philadelphia Eagles. No quarterback has done better than Brock Purdy in his Draft class.\nExpand Tweet\nGrading the QBs in Brock Purdy's draft class\nNow that we've listed the QBs selected ahead of Brock Purdy in his Draft class, it's high time we grade them. We'll start from the top.\n1. Kenny Pickett, Pittsburgh Steelers, Pick 20 - B\nPickett is the starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, and he has done a decent job in Pittsburgh. The University of Pittsburgh alum is a home-grown talent, and the fans are behind him. While he hasn't done anything special in the NFL just yet, he's one of just four QBs in the 2022 class that is currently an undisputed starter in the NFL.\n2. Desmond Ridder, Atlanta Falcons, Pick 74 - C\nRidder earned the starting quarterback job for the Falcons ahead of the 2023 NFL season. He hasn't been spectacular this season, but at least he's starting games at the highest level.\n3. Malik Willis, Tennessee Titans, Pick 86 - D\nWillis is the QB2 or QB3 in Tennessee, depending on who you ask. That's interesting, considering that some draft analysts thought him the most naturally gifted QB in the 2022 Draft class. Unfortunately, he is fighting a losing battle in Tennessee, as the franchise drafted the highly rated Will Levis to take his place. A \"D\" grade might even be generous.\n4. Matt Corral, Carolina Panthers, Pick 94 - E\nThe Panthers have mainly ignored Coral as they elected to trade up to number one for Bryce Young in the 2023 Draft. This tells you about the franchise's faith in the Ole Miss alum. Coral left the franchise ahead of his sophomore season.\n5. Bailey Zappe, New England Patriots, Pick 137 - C-\nMac Jones' backup plays for the worst Patriots team of the past twenty years. It's not a dream spot for the Western Kentucky alum.\n6. Sam Howell, Washington Commanders, Pick 144 - B\nHowell is the franchise quarterback for the usually trigger-happy Washington Commanders franchise. This shows that the Commanders' new ownership group has faith in Howell's ability to quarterback the team. He gets a positive grade for that sole reason.\n7. Chris Oladokun, Pittsburgh Steelers, Pick 241 - F\nOladokun is yet to make a start in the NFL. He'll be rated an F until he changes that. However, that won't be on the team that drafted him, as he was waived by the Steelers a while ago.\n8. Skylar Thompson, Miami Dolphins, Pick 247 - D\nThompson is the third-string QB for the Miami Dolphins heading into 2023. He could be eligible for a Super Bowl ring if the Dolphins go all the way.\n9. Brock Purdy, San Francisco 49ers, Pick 262 - A+\nArguably the best \"Mr. Irrelevant\" of all time. If Brock Purdy stays healthy in San Francisco, he can become one of his generation's finest QBs. We know it's clich\u00e9 at this point, but we might have the next Tom Brady right in front of us!\nDeebo Samuel or Odell Beckham Jr.?

{"title":"62% of TikTok users in the United States pay for a music streaming service (report)","context":"## 62% of TikTok users in the United States pay for a music streaming service (report)\n\nMBW\u2019s Stat Of The Week is a series in which we highlight a data point that deserves the attention of the global music industry. Stat Of the Week is supported by Cinq Music Group , a technology-driven record label, distribution, and rights management company.\nTikTok is in the process of reinventing itself as both a partner to music companies, and a competitor to streaming and distribution services.\nNow, a new market analysis sheds some light on why the ByteDance-owned short video platform has focused so intensely on expanding its services in the music world, with the firm reporting to be a major driver of music consumption and spending.\nWhile that may not come as a surprise to those who\u2019ve noted the overlap between TikTok and music culture, the numbers in the analysis shine a light on the scale of TikTok\u2019s influence.\nAccording to the analysis, commissioned by TikTok and carried out by US market monitor Luminate, 62% of US TikTok users pay for a music streaming service, compared to 43% of all consumers.\nTo produce TikTok\u2019s new report, which you can read in full here, Luminate researchers studied data from the US, UK, Germany, Brazil and Indonesia, as well as global data, for a 12-month period from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, and found that \u201ccompared to average consumers, TikTok users are significantly more likely to be music streamers\u201d.\nWe know that TikTok counted 150 million users in the United States as of February 2023, which means that, if we look at this stat through the lens of the Luminate analysis, then at this point it appears that approximately 93 million TikTok users in the US are paying for a subscription to one of the various streaming services available in the United States, including Spotify, Apple Music and others.\nTo put into context the number of music subscribers at individual streaming services in the market, we reported in July that as of February, in the United States, Spotify counted 44.4 million paying subscribers, while Spotify rival Apple Music had 32.6 million subscribers, and Amazon Music had 29.3 million subscribers.\nThe new TikTok study looked at consumption data from Luminate Connect, audience insight from the Luminate Music 360 Study, and TikTok engagement volumes provided by the platform in five markets: the US, UK, Brazil, Indonesia, and Germany, as well as globally (see below).\nIncluding both paid and ad-supported streaming services, roughly nine out of 10 TikTok users in each market studied used at least one music streaming service.\nIn the US, 89% of TikTok users subscribed to at least one music streaming service, compared to 74% of overall consumers, while in the UK, 85% of TikTok users had a streaming service account, compared to 62% of consumers overall.\n\u201cIn the global and US markets, TikTok user engagement metrics are strongly associated with streaming volumes. In other words, higher TikTok engagement \u2014 whether that\u2019s likes, views or shares \u2014 corresponds with elevated streaming volumes,\u201d the Luminate report stated.\nHowever, TikTok\u2019s impact on music isn\u2019t limited to DSPs. The analysis found that TikTok users are also larger spenders on music off-platform as well. By wide margins, they are more likely to buy merch and attend live shows than the average consumer.\nIn the US, 45% of TikTok users bought music-related merch over a 12-month period, compared to 35% of overall music listeners. Meanwhile, 38% attended a live music event during the year, compared to 33% of overall music listeners.\nOverall, US TikTok users spent 22% more on music-related purchases, compared to overall music listeners. A similar pattern was found in the four other countries they study looked at.\nThe study also found that the TikTok audience can be an effective marketing tool for artists, as TikTok users, in particular, are considerably more likely to discover and share music than overall social media and short video platform (SFV) users.\nIn the UK, TikTok users were 108% more likely to discover and share music than other social media users, while in Germany, they were 100% more likely. US TikTok users were 71% more likely to discover and share music.\n\u201cIn doing so, TikTok users help both emerging and established artists to reach new audiences,\u201d the Luminate report stated.\nThe study found that TikTok\u2019s platform appears to be a major driver of the glocalization of music \u2013 the trend of local artists, performing in local languages, being elevated to a regional or global platform.\n\u201cTikTok users have a stronger preference for international music than the average music listener,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis preference, combined with the high volume of music discovery and sharing activity on TikTok, can be harnessed to grow a fanbase without borders and has helped to launch global artists from genres such as Reggaeton, Afrobeats and K-Pop.\u201d\nThe report added: \u201cTikTok users\u2018 interest in international music is evident in their music streaming preferences. Compared to the average music listener across each market, this audience is more likely to indicate that \u2018access to music by global artists\u2019 is an extremely important factor when selecting a music streaming service.\u201d\n\u201cTikTok is already famous for being the launchpad for creating viral hits and breaking new artists, but we wanted to understand how TikTok and its users impact the music industry more broadly,\u201d Ole Obermann, TikTok\u2019s Global Head of Music, said in a statement.\n\u201cLuminate\u2019s findings prove what we had long known: that TikTok is the driving force behind music discovery in the industry, and that TikTok users are active, engaged and highly valuable drivers of music industry revenues.\u201d\nThe new study is part of an ongoing effort by TikTok to highlight its growing role in the development of global music culture. Last year, TikTok released a report asserting that 13 out of the 14 songs to reach number on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 2022 were driven by viral trends on TikTok.\nThe data clearly shows why TikTok has focused so heavily on developing music-related services, to the point that one could be forgiven for thinking the company plans to reinvent itself as a part of the music industry.\nLast year, TikTok launched SoundOn, its own music distribution service, which has partnered with Believe-owned distro company TuneCore and Downtown Holdings-owned B2B tech and services company FUGA.\n\u201cLuminate\u2019s findings prove what we had long known: that TikTok is the driving force behind music discovery in the industry, and that TikTok users are active, engaged and highly valuable drivers of music industry revenues.\u201d Ole Obermann, TikTok\nThis past summer, TikTok launched its own music streaming service, TikTok Music, a premium-only service initially available in Brazil and Indonesia, featuring the catalogs of all three of the major global recording companies (Sony Music, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group).\nIt quickly expanded the service to Australia, Mexico and Singapore, though without Universal\u2019s catalog.\nThis past October, TikTok announced it would be holding its first-ever live music event, dubbed \u201cTikTok In The Mix.\u201d\nThe same month, it struck a deal with Distrokid to have indie artists upload their music to TikTok Music and to Capcut, TikTok\u2019s video editing software, as well as to TikTok\u2019s Commercial Music Library, which offers a catalog of music for brands to use in their TikTok ads.\nMeanwhile, TikTok parent ByteDance has launched an AI music-making app, and most recently, TikTok unveiled the \u201cAdd to Music App\u201d feature, which enables TikTok users to save music they\u2019ve discovered directly to their Apple Music, Amazon Music (Prime or Unlimited) or Spotify accounts.\nThese new partnerships indicate that TikTok is moving away from what at times appeared to be a trying relationship with the music industry. In one notable incident, TikTok disabled the use of copyrighted music for users in Australia, in what the platform described as an experiment, and what many observers saw as a hardball tactic in its licensing negotiations with music rights holders.\nOne remaining \u2013 and major \u2013 potential pitfall for TikTok has to do with the rise in tensions between China and Western countries.\nAmid concerns that parent company ByteDance may be sharing TikTok user data with the Chinese government, numerous governments \u2013 from the US to the European Union to Australia \u2013 have banned the app from government-issued devices.\nA small number of jurisdictions have banned or are attempting to ban TikTok altogether, including Montana and, most recently, Nepal.\nCinq Music Group\u2019s repertoire has won Grammy awards, dozens of Gold and Platinum RIAA certifications, and numerous No.1 chart positions on a variety of Billboard charts. Its repertoire includes heavyweights such as Bad Bunny, Janet Jackson, Daddy Yankee, T.I., Sean Kingston, Anuel, and hundreds more.Music Business Worldwide\n\nThis article, authored by Daniel Tencer, was published by Music Business Worldwide on 2023-11-21 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":363}
{"title":"The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses actually make the future look cool","context":"## The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses actually make the future look cool\n\nI\u2019m a smart glasses skeptic. Not because the technology is impossible but because I\u2019ve tested several pairs and even dove deep into the category for a two-part mini-documentary a while back. So when I say I was impressed by the $299 Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, it\u2019s not just that mine came with rose-colored lenses.\nTo be clear, nothing about the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses is revolutionary. The Google Glass Explorer Edition first introduced us to modern-day smart glasses in 2013. Several other companies, big and small, have since jumped on the bandwagon, including Snap, Bose, Razer, Epson, Amazon, and the now-defunct Focals by North. Most were underwhelming, with potato cameras, washed-out displays, useless voice assistants, and middling mics. I had a hard time imagining the average person liking them enough to own a pair.\nI know multiple people who have already bought these.\n7 Verge Score Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses $ 299 The Good Improved photo, video, and audio quality\nYou sound good on calls!\nStylish, with many options for frames and lenses\nImporting photos and videos is easy\nCharging case design is also much better The Bad Voice assistant is a lil slow\nCool AI features not available yet\nLED privacy indicator still too subtle\nBattery life improved but could be better $299 at Amazon$299 at Best Buy How we rate and review products\nI get why. These glasses look good. They officially come in 150 style variations across two frame styles, seven colors, and multiple lens options (including color, prescription, and transitions). The camera has been upgraded from 5MP to 12MP. Photo resolution has improved to 3024 x 4032 pixels, while videos are now 1080p at 30 frames per second. There are now five mics instead of one, so you sound better on calls. The speaker quality has also improved. It\u2019s louder, with more bass, less audio leakage, and spatial audio support. They stuffed some AI in there, and you can now livestream to Facebook or Instagram. These are significant updates.\nIt\u2019d be one thing if Meta failed to deliver, but like I said: I\u2019m impressed. But that, in turn, has raised a lot of questions that I don\u2019t have answers for. All I can say is whatever you think of Meta, these are a turning point for smart glasses.\nGlasses fit for Bond (Or Eggsy)\nI\u2019ve only seen a handful of Bond flicks, but even I know two things about Agent 007. James Bond looks good, always, and the spy gadgets Q gives him are discreet. The Meta glasses are both and, in many ways, feel like they belong in a spy movie.\nI often felt like I was in a spy movie when wearing these.\nThe thing about smart glasses is that you\u2019ll never wear a pair if they make you look like a low-rent Warby Parker model. Aside from the original Bose Frames, I\u2019ve never really liked the way I\u2019ve looked in smart glasses so far. That\u2019s why it matters that these are Ray-Bans and come in more styles than typical smart glasses. While Wayfarers are considered to be universally flattering, rounder frames look better on me. Most smart glasses come in tortoiseshell or black, and I\u2019m tired of both, so I was happy that I could pick a round, transparent blue frame with pink lenses. They\u2019re more my style, and while I wish the colors were more noticeable in darker lighting, I dug the extra pop of color in sunlight. I wore these in various scenarios: dolled up for a wedding, clad in functional but hideous running gear, bumming it in sweatpants, and rocking leather jackets. You name it \u2014 it goes with everything.\nOn top of looking good, no one will know you\u2019re wearing tech on your face unless you walk around saying \u201cHey Meta\u201d at the top of your lungs. Nobody knew I was listening to EXO\u2019s EXIST album on my commute. You can hear some faint audio leakage when you\u2019re at full volume, but that\u2019s only necessary when trying to block out the squeaky rails of the New York City subway system. Your fellow commuters likely won\u2019t notice because they\u2019ve got AirPods in or the ambient noise is louder. More troubling, no one batted an eye whenever I took photos and videos in public or private areas.\nThese can look black in dark lighting, but in the right light, I dig the way the blue and pink pop. You can see the capture button on the top of the right arm.\nAll this made me feel like Eggsy from Kingsman: The Golden Circle \u2014 another high-tech spy film. There\u2019s a scene where Eggsy takes a call through the glasses during an important dinner. To everyone else, he looked like a dapper gent with some snazzy frames about to eat some fancy food. But because of his glasses, Eggsy was able to hear (and see) things they couldn\u2019t. My experience wasn\u2019t exactly the same. (I had no imminent bombs to defuse.) But the point is I spent a lot of time wearing these in public doing and listening to things that people looking straight at me weren\u2019t aware of. It doesn\u2019t get more incognito than that.\nThat comes with pros and cons. I\u2019ll get to privacy in a bit, but if you\u2019re worried about looking like a total jabroni, like this pic of me wearing the Bose Frames Tempo, fear not.\nIn the name of content creation\nI have my priorities straight. As soon as I unboxed and paired these glasses, the first thing I did was take a photo and a video of my cats Petey and Pablo. I uploaded them to The Verge\u2019s Slack and sent the video to my spouse and friends. My tech-savvy co-workers found the quality to be surprisingly good for smart glasses. My friends and family thought it was something I took on my phone. Several times during this review process, our own video team remarked that the quality was better than they\u2019d expected.\nThat\u2019s wild.\nIf you\u2019re into photography, you\u2019ll be able to suss that the quality doesn\u2019t match up to the latest and greatest phones. But it\u2019s good enough to match a phone from a few years ago and, therefore, shareable on social media and in the group chat. That\u2019s a Big Deal.\nTo take photos or videos, you can use the \u201cHey Meta\u201d command or use the capture button on the top of the right arm. You press once for photos and long-press to start recording video. There are also accompanying audio cues and an LED in your right peripheral vision.\nThis is the LED capture indicator on the right side of the frame. It\u2019s off in this picture. The camera is opposite, in front of the left hinge.\nI\u2019m not a camera expert, so I asked our resident camera expert Becca Farsace to weigh in. One thing Becca pointed out was the stabilization on the camera is surprisingly good. While there\u2019s some wobbliness, it doesn\u2019t look like garbage, especially when viewed on a phone. Low-light performance was also better than I anticipated. When you move from light to dark environments, you don\u2019t really notice a massive drop in video quality. Color reproduction and details are also solid in good lighting.\nI appreciated taking phone-free, hands-free videos in my day-to-day life. I now have so many videos of Petey and Pablo being adorable that would have been difficult to capture otherwise because both my cats get weird when they see my phone come out. They either refuse to look at the camera, leave, or \u2014 in Petey\u2019s case \u2014 try to eat the camera. It\u2019s also easier to film and interact with my cats when I have both hands free. Case in point, I have enjoyed partaking in the cat-twirling meme \u2014 even if it was quite the feat lifting a 19-pound Pablo.\nHad to get in on the cat twirling meme.\nEven if you aren\u2019t obsessed with your pets, I can see this being a more discreet alternative for a GoPro. It\u2019d be easy to film cooking instructions, parts of running or cycling routes, a scenic drive, or even capturing slice-of-life candids of your kids before they grow up too fast.\nThat said, there are quirks. What you see isn\u2019t what the camera sees because it\u2019s not actually in your eyeball. It\u2019s in front of the left hinge. You have to remember that when framing your shots, or everything will be mildly off-center. This is also how I learned I often tilt my head like a confused puppy. Many times, I went back to photos and videos I\u2019d shot to find they featured unintentional Dutch angles and wisps (or full chunks) of my bangs. Becca had issues with her hat popping up in shots as well.\nAlso, there\u2019s a one- to two-second delay when taking photos. While walking, a lot of my landscape photos came out blurry if I didn\u2019t stand completely still. It\u2019d be easier if there was a way to preview images via your phone, but there isn\u2019t unless you\u2019re livestreaming.\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n1 \/ 6 Curtain bangs are the enemy with these smart galsses. Previous Next\n\n\n\n\n1 \/ 6 Curtain bangs are the enemy with these smart galsses.\nSpeaking of which, livestreaming was hard to test organically, mainly because none of my Instagram followers expect me to livestream. What I can say is that a glasses icon pops up automatically on the livestream screen in Facebook or Instagram. (Though, let\u2019s be real \u2014 most content creators aren\u2019t livestreaming to Facebook.) You can either tap the icon or double-click the capture button to seamlessly switch views between your phone camera and glasses. There\u2019s a teeny lag between what you see versus what gets livestreamed, but nothing egregious.\nLivestreaming is an example where Meta sort of shot itself in the foot as far as content creation goes. I have no doubt some streamers would love this if they could use this on TikTok or Twitch. But they can\u2019t. Instead, they\u2019re corralled into Meta\u2019s services. It makes sense \u2014 Big Tech loves protecting its walled gardens \u2014 but from a broader adoption perspective, this is silly. It\u2019s one of the reasons Snap\u2019s Spectacles never took off. Meta\u2019s mostly lucky that Instagram is still popular with influencers.\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n1 \/ 6 Petey seconds before deciding to run amok. Previous Next\n\n\n\n\n1 \/ 6 Petey seconds before deciding to run amok.\nIt\u2019s also easy to import photos and videos from the glasses to your phone, even if you\u2019re on the go. The glasses have their own local Wi-Fi network, and your phone just needs to connect to it with the Meta View app open. It can be a little slow if you have a lot of footage, but even then, it\u2019s not too bad. For example, yesterday, I imported 143 videos and photos. It took a few tries to establish a stable connection, but altogether, it only took about five minutes. It\u2019s a lot faster \u2014 maybe two or three minutes \u2014 if you\u2019re sending 15 or fewer photos or videos.\nOne potential con is that videos max out at one minute. Meta says that\u2019s to optimize storage and importing, which is a fair tradeoff in my book. These are clearly meant for social content, especially since all photos and videos are vertical, and there\u2019s no landscape option. Generally, you\u2019re not watching more than a minute-long clip on Reels, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts anyway.\nThe charging case is sleeker, easier to stash, and has an LED charging status light that doubles as a button. The charging status works for the case itself if empty or for the glasses if they\u2019re inside.\nAnother thing for content creators to consider is battery life. If you use these lightly, you can get five, maybe six hours on a single charge. If you\u2019re taking a ton of video and photos, that\u2019s going to dwindle to three or four hours. Using the glasses as headphones in my 70-minute commute drained the battery by about 18 to 20 percent. I doubt this will trouble casual users, seeing as these are still a functional pair of glasses if the battery\u2019s dead. But power users \u2014 folks who want to get through a whole day of meetings while using these as headphone replacements \u2014 may find this annoying.\nThere are a few mitigating factors. The charging case is a lot slimmer than the previous version, and it is easy to stash in a fanny pack, purse, and backpack. It charges via USB-C, and there\u2019s a new indicator LED button that turns orange while charging and green when everything is full. (This is both for the case itself when it\u2019s empty and for the glasses when they\u2019re in there.) Charging is quick, too. The other day, I went from 15 percent battery after three hours of heavy use to 100 percent in less than an hour. I\u2019ve also had these for a whole week, and aside from the initial charge, I haven\u2019t had to plug in the case whatsoever. You do end up charging the frames multiple times a day because where else are you going to put them when they\u2019re not in use if not the case?\nHeadphone replacement?\nThe nice thing about these glasses is you don\u2019t have to use the camera at all. They\u2019re also a viable replacement for your headphones. Unlike the camera, the audio features works like any other Bluetooth headset in terms of what apps you can use, though there is one built-in Spotify integration you can enable.\nYou control the audio with a gesture control area on the right arm, just under the capture button. There\u2019s a library of gestures in the app, but the most basic ones are tapping once to pause \/ play audio and sliding forward and back to control volume. Tapping twice will play the next track, while three taps will let you go back a track. If you enable Spotify Tap, you can tap and hold to play your automatic recommendations based on your favorites. On the left arm, right on the hinge, there\u2019s also a small toggle that lets you cut the Bluetooth connection and power to the camera.\nAudio quality for music and podcasts is on par with other smart glasses. Like other open-ear headphones, they\u2019re not the best at reproducing thumping bass, but they are better than any ambient mode at helping you maintain situational awareness. Noise-canceling headphones, however, are much more effective at blocking out the world.\nThe arms are thick because they contain a lot of the smarts, like mics and directional speakers, that make these a solid pair of open-ear headphones.\nThere are speakers and microphones in the left-hand arm as well. This tiny toggle in the hinge also cuts Bluetooth and the camera if you don\u2019t need it.\nCalls are another story. These glasses trump the majority of smart glasses I\u2019ve tested. I\u2019ve taken a few calls from my spouse while on the go in loud environments. I had no trouble hearing them, and they had zero issues hearing me (provided I had good cell service). That\u2019s likely because there are now five mics, one of which is in the nose pad. It made me sound clear in all my videos \u2014 almost like I was the main character in a first-person video game.\nTapping once on the right side starts or pauses your audio. Sliding forward or back controls volume. Tapping twice opens up Spotify favorites.\nThe lenses you pick can impact whether you want to use these as headphone alternatives. Because Meta sent me a pair of sunglasses, it was tough to see how well these would fare in my usual workday. My greatest regret was not getting these with clear lenses or transitions because sunglasses are limiting. I\u2019m not trying to be one of those people who wears sunglasses indoors. I tried for the sake of this review, but it hurt my eyes after an hour or two. The Transition lenses cost $80 more and are the best option if you want to use these in as many scenarios as possible. As for prescriptions, you can order them directly from Ray-Ban or a participating LensCrafters if you fall in the -6 to +4 range. If you\u2019ve got worse vision, like me, you may want to use them with contact lenses. Otherwise, you could take them to a local optician, but that would void the warranty.\nThe other neat thing is spatial audio. When you watch videos, you can hear where people were when it was recorded. Alex Cranz, managing editor of The Verge, crept behind me while I was recording at the office to say, \u201cVictoria sucks.\u201d When I replayed it, I could hear her trolling me from behind. Is it something you\u2019ll make use of often? Probably not, but it\u2019s fun nevertheless.\nBut is it really smart?\nNot really. At least, not in the way you\u2019ve probably envisioned smart glasses from sci-fi movies.\nFor example, the Meta AI and voice assistant? It\u2019s nothing like Peter Parker issuing commands to EDITH via the smart aviators he got from Tony Stark in Spider-Man: Far From Home. While the Meta assistant sounds very natural, it can\u2019t do a whole lot of stuff yet, and it takes a hot second to process commands. The most I used it for was taking photos and videos hands-free, listening to texts as they came in, as well as sending messages. But even here, the Meta assistant got tripped up because my spouse apparently has multiple entries in my contact list. While you can send normal texts, most of my contacts aren\u2019t on Messenger or WhatsApp, and these don\u2019t natively share to non-Meta apps. I imagine this will be more useful to you if these are apps you use frequently.\nThere are five mics total, including one in the nose pad that is surprisingly good at making sure you sound clear on calls.\nWhile AI features on the glasses are in beta, I can\u2019t say that I was ever itching to use a ChatGPT-esque bot in the ways Meta suggested (i.e., writing raps and poems, generating excuses to get out of parties, etc.) However, down the road, audio AI bots could be a useful form of augmented reality. The first version of the Bose Frames tried to make audio augmented reality apps a thing but crashed and burned when third-party developers didn\u2019t glom onto the idea. Meta\u2019s approach is a bit different. In a future feature drop, you\u2019ll be able to ask the AI to identify objects in your surroundings via the camera. That\u2019s a cool idea, and I\u2019ll be eager to see how it works if and when it arrives.\nBut all said and done, I\u2019m glad Meta didn\u2019t bother attempting a smart display. The tech isn't there yet. When I tried Google Glass Enterprise Edition, Epson Moverio glasses, and Focals by North, trying to focus on the information overlays was hard on my eyes. That\u2019s because these tend to rely on projection tech, which can get easily washed out by bright ambient light. And navigating screens usually requires some kind of physical control. It\u2019s clunky, kills battery life, and introduces the problem of developing third-party app ecosystems.\nPrivacy: am I the glasshole?\nIt\u2019s hard to think of smart glasses without remembering that time when a pair of Google Glass got ripped off a person\u2019s face. How subsequently, the people wearing Glass were dubbed glassholes, and how some public spaces banned the device entirely.\nBut we live in a different era now. People are wearing Quest 3 headsets to coffee shops. Every time I open TikTok, I see normal people and content creators alike vlogging their lives. When I walk outside, people are having very private conversations out loud on FaceTime or through their AirPods. For better or worse, the smartphone has made us all very comfortable with the idea that there are cameras everywhere.\nDo you ever really know who\u2019s filming you, with what, and when?\nThe problem is we don\u2019t have the same social cues for smart glasses as we do phones. If you hold your phone up in a certain way, people know it means you\u2019re recording. If you hold your finger up to the temple of your glasses, you could be adjusting the fit. To address that, Meta added an LED capture light to the original Ray-Ban Stories. Most people didn\u2019t think it was enough. This time around, Meta has made it so you can\u2019t disable the LED light, and it has a pulsing pattern that\u2019s supposed to be more noticeable. When I polled my co-workers, friends, and family, it was a mixed bag. Some said it was easily seen indoors. Others disagreed. Most agreed that while you can see the light outdoors, it\u2019s also easy to ignore or mistake for light reflecting off the lenses.\nI took pictures and filmed many times in public, and no one ever noticed. Take from that what you will.\nWould you realistically notice someone wearing these glasses over a regular pair of sunglasses? Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nMeta has privacy guidelines and etiquette tips when you set the glasses up and a link to its privacy page in the app. It boils down to don\u2019t be a glasshole. That\u2019s nice, but glassholes are going to use this device however they please. The rest of us have to figure out how to not be a glasshole on the fly.\nFor example, these glasses are perfect for an outdoor wedding. I just so happened to be invited to one this past weekend. But while it\u2019s normal to take photos and record wedding footage on your phone, would that apply to content taken on smart glasses? It felt wrong to make any unilateral decision, so I asked my friend for permission.\nWould you notice this privacy LED light? Because it means I\u2019m recording.\nWhile it was weird to explain, she gave me her blessing. I got to protect my eyes from the sun, discreetly record the ceremony for the couple, keep my phone in my bag, and stay present in the moment. Afterward, my friend was happy to have that footage since there wasn\u2019t a videographer. At the same time, you won\u2019t find those photos or videos in this review because this was a private ceremony. I\u2019m glad that was a conversation I had beforehand, but would anyone in 2023 feel compelled to do this with phones? I can\u2019t count the times I\u2019ve seen people take photos of weddings and post them directly to their own personal feeds.\nAm I the glasshole for filming my commute to test these glasses?\nThis applies to so many scenarios. If I take concert footage, am I the glasshole? What if I\u2019m house hunting and want to remember what a property looked like later? Do I alert the real estate agent? What if I\u2019m wearing these as headphones, enter a public restroom, and somebody freaks out because they notice I\u2019m wearing smart glasses? Am I the glasshole for filming my commute to test these glasses? Or is asking permission from my fellow commuters potentially opening me up to physical harm? Is wearing what\u2019s essentially a face-mounted bodycam an invasion of privacy, or is it a safety tool? A co-worker told me they bought a pair of these glasses partly because if someone tries to murder them while walking the dog, they can grab footage of their potential assailant.\nI have no real answers here. If everyone had a pair of these tomorrow, would I start to treat people wearing Wayfarers differently? A part of me wishes that I\u2019d be the wary privacy stalwart. But the depressing reality is I already live like everything in my life is surveilled. What do a few hundred extra smart glasses cameras matter?\nA turning point\nI\u2019ll say it again. Meta isn\u2019t reinventing smart glasses. What it\u2019s done is nail the execution. Culturally, I also think the timing is ripe. We\u2019re more desensitized than ever to surveillance, and a lot of us are trying to look less at phone screens. If smartwatches can field notifications, then maybe smart glasses can replace the camera and take calls in scenarios where phones aren\u2019t ideal.\nI have no idea if these will succeed, but they\u2019re the most practical smart glasses I\u2019ve worn yet.\nAre good execution and timing enough? At heart, I remain a smart glasses skeptic. To me, this device appeals most to gadget nerds and content creators rather than the average Joe. But even if these flop, it\u2019s set a new bar for what smart glasses can and should be able to do. Again, I\u2019ve tried a ton of smart glasses, and until now, I\u2019ve never had a pair that looks good, is priced reasonably, has multiple use cases, and delivers what it says it will.\n\nThis article, authored by Victoria Song, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-20 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":364}
{"title":"8 predictions for AI in 2024","context":"## 8 predictions for AI in 2024\n\n8 predictions for AI in 2024 How will AI impact the US primary elections? What's next for OpenAI? Here are our predictions for AI in 2024.\nThis last year was a banger for AI as the technology went from niche to mainstream about as fast as anything ever has. 2024, however, will be the year when the hype runs full-steam into reality as people reckon with the capabilities and limitations of AI at large. Here are a few ways we think that\u2019s going to play out.\nOpenAI becomes a product company\nAfter the leadership shake-up in November, OpenAI is going to be a changed company \u2014 perhaps not outwardly, but the trickle-down effect of Sam Altman being more fully in charge will be felt at every level. And one of the ways we expect that to manifest is in \u201cship it\u201d mindset.\nWe\u2019ll see that with the GPT store, originally planned for launch in December but understandably delayed due to the C-suite fracas. The \u201capp store for AI\u201d will be pushed hard as the platform to get your AI toys and tools from, and never mind Hugging Face or any open source models. They have an excellent model to work from, Apple\u2019s, and will follow it all the way to the bank.\nExpect more moves like that from 2024\u2019s OpenAI as the caution and academic reserve that the previous board exerted gives way to an unseemly lust for markets and customers.\nOther major companies with AI efforts will also follow this trend (for instance, expect Gemini\/Bard to horn in on a ton of Google products), but I suspect it will be more pronounced in this case.\nAgents, generated video and generated music graduate from quaint to experimental\nSome niche applications of AI models will grow beyond \u201ceh\u201d status in 2024, including agent-based models and generative multimedia.\nIf AI is going to help you do more than summarize or make lists of things, it\u2019ll need access to things like your spreadsheets, ticket buying interfaces, transportation apps and so on. 2023 saw a few tentative attempts at this \u201cagent\u201d approach, but none really caught on. We don\u2019t really expect any to really take off in 2024, either, but agent-based models will show their stuff a little more convincingly than they did last year, and a few clutch use cases will show up for famously tedious processes like submitting insurance claims.\nVideo and audio will also find niches where their shortcomings aren\u2019t quite so visible. In the hands of skilled creators, a lack of photorealism isn\u2019t a problem, and we\u2019ll see AI video used in fun and interesting ways. Likewise, generative music models will likely make it into a few major productions like games, again where professional musicians can leverage the tools to create an unending soundtrack.\nThe limits of monolithic LLMs become clearer\nSo far there has been great optimism about the capabilities of large language models, which have indeed proved more capable than anyone expected, and have grown correspondingly more so as more compute is added. But 2024 will be the year something gives. Where exactly it is impossible to predict, as research is active at the frontiers of this field.\nThe seemingly magical \u201cemergent\u201d capabilities of LLMs will be better studied and understood in 2024, and things like their inability to multiply large numbers will make more sense.\nIn parallel, we will begin to see diminishing returns on parameter counts, to the point where training a 500-billion-parameter model may technically produce better results, but the compute required to do so could provably be deployed more effectively. A single monolithic model is unwieldy and expensive, while a mixture of experts \u2014 a collection of smaller, more specific models and likely multimodal ones \u2014 may prove almost as effective while being much easier to update piecemeal.\nMarketing meets reality\nThe simple fact is that the hype built up in 2023 is going to be very hard for companies to follow through on. Marketing claims made for machine learning systems that companies adopted in order to not fall behind will receive their quarterly and yearly reviews\u2026 and it\u2019s very likely they will be found wanting.\nExpect a considerable customer withdrawal from AI tools as the benefits fail to justify the costs and risks. On the far end of this spectrum, we are likely to see lawsuits and regulatory action with AI service providers that failed to back up their claims.\nWhile capabilities will continue to grow and advance, 2023\u2019s products will not all survive by a long shot, and there will be a round of consolidation as the wobblier riders of the wave fall and are consumed.\nApple jumps in\nApple has an established pattern of waiting, watching and learning from other companies\u2019 failures, then blowing in with a refined and polished take that puts others to shame. The timing is right for Apple to do this in AI, not just because if it waits too long its competition may eat up the market, but because the tech is ripe for their kind of improvement.\nI would expect an AI that focuses on practical applications of users\u2019 own data, using Apple\u2019s increasingly central position in their lives to integrate the many signals and ecosystems the company is privy to. There will likely also be a clever and elegant way to handle problematic or dangerous prompts, and although it will almost certainly have multimodal understanding (primarily to handle user images), I imagine they\u2019ll totally skip media generation. Expect some narrowly tailored but impressive agent capabilities as well: \u201cSiri, get a table for 4 at a sushi place downtown around 7 and book a car to take us\u201d sort of thing.\nWhat\u2019s hard to say is whether they will bill it as an improved Siri or as a whole new service, Apple AI, with a name you can choose yourself. They may feel the old brand is freighted with years of being comparatively incapable, but millions already say \u201chey Siri\u201d every 10 seconds so it\u2019s more likely they\u2019ll opt to keep that momentum.\nLegal cases build and break\nWe saw a fair number of lawsuits filed in 2023, but few saw any real movement, let alone success. Most suits over copyright and other missteps in the AI industry are still pending. 2024 will see a lot of them fall by the wayside, as companies stonewall critical information like training data and methods, making allegations like the use of thousands of copyrighted books difficult to prove in court.\nThis was only the beginning, however, and many of these lawsuits were filed essentially on principle. Though they may not succeed, they may crack the process open far enough during testimony and discovery that companies would rather settle than have certain information come to light. 2024 will bring new lawsuits as well, ones pertaining to misuse and abuse of AI, such as wrongful termination, bias in hiring and lending, and other areas where AI is being put to work without a lot of thought.\nBut while a few egregious examples of misuse will be punished, a lack of relevant laws specific to it means that it will necessarily only haphazardly be brought to court. On that note\u2026\nEarly adopters take new rules by the horns\nBig moves like the EU\u2019s AI Act could change how the industry works, but they tend to be slow to take effect. That\u2019s by design, so companies don\u2019t have to adjust to new rules overnight, but it also means that we won\u2019t see the effect of these big laws for a good while except among those willing to make changes preemptively and voluntarily. There will be a lot of \u201cwe are beginning the process of\u2026\u201d talk. (Also expect a few quiet lawsuits challenging various parts of laws.)\nTo that end we can expect a newly flourishing AI compliance industry as the billions going into the technology prompt matching investments (at a smaller scale, but still considerable) in making sure the tools and processes meet international and local standards.\nUnfortunately for anyone hoping for substantive federal regulation in the U.S., 2024 is not the year to expect movement on that front. Though it will be a year for AI and everyone will be asking for new laws, the U.S. government and electorate will be too busy with the trash fire that will be the 2024 election.\nThe 2024 election is a trash fire and AI makes it worse\nHow the 2024 presidential election will play out is, really, anyone\u2019s guess right now. Too many things are up in the air to make any real predictions except that, as before, the influence mongers will use every tool in the box to move the needle, including AI in whatever form is convenient.\nFor instance, expect bot accounts and fake blogs to spout generated nonsense 24\/7. A few people working full time with a text and image generator can cover a lot of ground, generating hundreds of social media and blog posts with totally fabricated images and news. \u201cFlooding the zone\u201d has always been an effective tactic and now AI acts as a labor multiplier, allowing more voluminous yet also targeted campaigns.

{"title":"Inside the Man United takeover and it\u2019s anything but smooth sailing for Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he seeks board vote","context":"## Inside the Man United takeover and it\u2019s anything but smooth sailing for Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he seeks board vote\n\nIn November, it will have been a year since the deeply unpopular Glazer family left Manchester United fans rejoicing by announcing they were open to offers for England\u2019s most iconic football club.\nEleven months on and the saga that, at times has resembled an X-Factor style judges houses audition, may finally be coming to an end as British petrochemicals billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe closes in on a partial takeover.\n5 Sir Jim Ratcliffe has an offer on the table for 25 per cent stake of Manchester United Credit: AFP\nRatcliffe\u2019s \u00a31.3billion offer for a 25 per stake in the club he has supported since childhood will be high on the agenda when United\u2019s board of directors meet on Thursday, but how did we get to this point, what happens next and what could the future look like at Old Trafford?\nTIMELINE OF THE TAKEOVER SAGA\nIt was in November 2022 as Qatar became the centre of the football universe during the controversial 2022 World Cup that the Glazers revealed they were looking to cash in all or at least some of their shares.\nThe bombshell announcement was seen by the majority of Manchester United fans as the beginning of the end of the divisive and destructive regime that began with a now-outlawed leveraged buyout in 2005 and saddled the club with debts that at one stage soared to as high as \u00a31bn.\nBrothers Joel and Avram, the two most hands-on of the six Glazer siblings who have overall control of United, had instructed the New York-based Raine banking group to handle the bidding process.\nThis was a move mainly influenced by the fact Raine had managed to broker a deal with Todd Boehly to commit to invest \u00a34.5bn to take control of Chelsea, giving the Glazers grand ideas they could rake in as much as DOUBLE for a global sporting institution like United.\nAfter several rounds of bidding, it quickly became clear the race for United was a straight shootout between Oldham-born Ratcliffe, who had previously offered \u00a34bn to buy Chelsea, and Qatari Sheikh Jassim bin Al Thani, who also professed to being a lifelong Red Devils fan and set up the \u201992 Foundation\u2019 in tribute to the famous class of \u201992 of David Beckham and company.\n5 Ratcliffe already owns Nice in France and Lausanne in Switzerland Credit: AFP\nInitially it was hoped the bidding process would be concluded in time for the summer transfer window, but the longer it dragged on, prompting several large-scale protests from United fans, the more apparent it became that Joel and Avram were reluctant sellers, as revealed by talkSPORT in March.\nSheikh Jassim\u2019s public statement promising to restore United \u2018to former glories\u2019 was also seen as thinly-veiled swipe at the Glazers, which did not help his negotiating hand.\nThe Qatari banker\u2019s patience finally snapped and his withdrawal from the bidding process at the end of last week has left the pathway clear for Ratcliffe to complete what he has always viewed as his dream purchase.\nWHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS FOR RATCLIFFE?\ntalkSPORT understands Ratcliffe, having originally wanted a much larger up-front stake, has an agreement in principle to buy a 25 per cent share in United.\n5 Joel and Avram Glazer put the Red Devils up for sale in November 2022 Credit: AFP\n5 United supporters are desperate to see the Glazers depart Old Trafford Credit: Twitter\nThe fact the Glazers will remain in situ has not gone down well with supporters, but this is seen as the first step to Ratcliffe eventually removing the Americans and taking overall control.\nThe exact timescale as to when that happens remains vague and how much it will cost Ratcliffe overall could depend on United\u2019s sporting and commercial success in the coming seasons.\nThursday\u2019s board meeting was pre-arranged and while it is expected that Ratcliffe\u2019s proposal will discussed in detail, sources close to United have indicated to talkSPORT that it is far from guaranteed it will be put to a vote with several details still to be thrashed out.\nAs and when it does get as far as a vote, Ratcliffe can be confident it will be ratified seeing as half of the 12-strong board are members of the Glazer family and in the event of a split vote, Joel and Avram as co-chairmen will have the deciding say.\nEven once the final deal is agreed, it is likely to take at least a couple of months for Ratcliffe to pass the Premier League\u2019s owners and directors test, which has been made more stringent since Portsmouth became the first top-flight side to go into administration in 2010.\n5 Ratcliffe, one of Britain's wealthiest men, previously tried to buy Chelsea\nWHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE UNDER RATCLIFFE\u2019S INEOS GROUP?\nRatcliffe is demanding an executive role and overall control of day-to-day football matters and plans to appoint his own sporting director, with former Tottenham and Southampton transfer guru Paul Mitchell one of the main names in the frame.\nThat raises doubts over the future of current sporting director John Murtough and chief executive Richard Arnold, although manager Erik ten Hag is believed to be on a solid footing despite United\u2019s poor start to the season.\nExpect Sir Dave Brailsford, the mastermind behind Team GB\u2019s cycling success at the London 2012 Olympics and director of sport for Ratcliffe\u2019s company INEOS, to have a prominent role in any reshuffle.\nRatcliffe also has ambitious plans to upgrade Old Trafford and turn it into a 90,000-seat stadium.\nHe wants the deal ratified in time for the January transfer window, however due to FFP concerns, there is no guarantees United will be able to spend big.\nDespite the fact he turns 71 a day before the board meeting, it appears Ratcliffe\u2019s plans centre around long-term stability and success rather than a short-term turnaround in United\u2019s fortunes.\n\nThis article, authored by Damian Mannion, was published by TalkSport on 2023-10-18 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":366}
{"title":"Uber sexual assault survivors call for in-car cameras, tech upgrades","context":"## Uber sexual assault survivors call for in-car cameras, tech upgrades\n\nHundreds of women have filed lawsuits against Uber claiming the company hasn\u2019t done enough to prevent instances of sexual assault by drivers. Now a panel of judges has ruled that more than 80 cases can be consolidated into federal court.\nThe stakes are high for both parties with implications extending to future Uber riders and drivers. The outcome of the case could result in sweeping changes to Uber\u2019s platform, which plaintiffs argue will reduce sexual assault and also raise new concerns over privacy.\nThe upshot? Technology lies at the center of this very human story.\nUber has attempted to address sexual assaults by drivers \u2014 which the lawsuits claim Uber has known about since 2014 \u2014 through new safety features in its app, like a 911 button and the ability to share location with a friend. Yet survivors, and their attorneys, say that response has been inadequate, and they\u2019re calling for better technological solutions like in-vehicle surveillance cameras.\nAside from the 911 button and location-sharing feature, which were both introduced in 2018, Uber has added other features to the app over the last five years. In 2021, Uber introduced a feature that allows riders and drivers to record audio during a trip. The following year, Uber launched a pilot to provide passengers with live help from an ADT safety agent, as well as PIN verifications to ensure passengers are connected to the correct driver.\nRachel Abrams \u2014 a sexual assault attorney and partner at law firm Peiffer Wolf Carr Kane Conway & Wise, one of the law firms working on the multidistrict litigation, who filed the petition to consolidate the various actions in federal court \u2014 argues the app-based solutions are half-measures that haven\u2019t quelled instances of sexual violence against passengers on the platform. Mandatory in-vehicle cameras in Uber cars is \u201cessential for safety,\u201d she says.\nUber told TechCrunch it cannot comment on pending litigation but said it remains committed to the safety of all users on its platform.\nIn-vehicle cameras as a deterrent\nAbrams cited data from studies of taxis equipped with in-vehicle cameras, which she says has drastically reduced instances of sexual assaults against passengers, as well as assault of passengers against drivers.\n\u201cThese are predatory, opportunistic drivers taking advantage of vulnerable women, so if they\u2019re on film, they likely wouldn\u2019t commit the crime,\u201d Abrams told TechCrunch.\nUber didn\u2019t respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for more information about why it hasn\u2019t mandated the use of cameras in ride-hail vehicles, but as with any surveillance, there are privacy issues. The legality of mandating cameras also varies across local and state laws.\nAbrams has her own theory as to why Uber has been slow to implement security cameras.\n\u201cCost isn\u2019t the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that it would deter drivers because a lot of drivers don\u2019t want cameras. And so if they don\u2019t have drivers, they don\u2019t make money.\u201d\nMany drivers install their own dash cams to record trips, usually as backup evidence for insurance claims or to defend themselves against unfair deactivations from Uber\u2019s platform. Uber is also piloting a new video recording feature for drivers that allows them to record video on their smartphones. But in those cases, the driver can decide what and when to record, and when to share that data.\nOther demands\nThe survivors in the joined lawsuit also allege that Uber\u2019s \u201cfast and shallow background checks\u201d are substandard and designed to make it as easy as possible for drivers to sign up quickly. Uber uses third-party companies like Checkr and Appriss to do background checks, which Sergio Avedian, senior contributor at The Rideshare Guy, says \u201care at best watered down and not guaranteed of bad apples from falling through the cracks.\u201d\nThe lawsuit calls on Uber to also include fingerprinting, which would run prospective drivers through FBI databases.\n\u201cThis is a very intentional and deliberate decision as evidenced by Uber\u2019s active lobbying and resistance against municipalities and regulatory bodies implementing any kind of biometric fingerprinting requirements for drivers,\u201d said Kevin Conway, managing partner at Peiffer Wolf Carr Kane Conway & Wise.\nUber has lobbied against additional background requirements for drivers, which has given the company authority to conduct its own background checks with little or no oversight, unlike most taxi operators.\nUber and Lyft say smudged fingerprints can lead to inaccurate results and that fingerprint checks reference historical arrest records, which can have discriminatory effects on some minority communities that face disproportionately high arrest rates. An Uber spokesperson told CNN arrest records are incomplete and often lack information about whether a person has been convicted of a crime.\nAside from in-vehicle surveillance and more extensive background checks, the survivors are asking Uber to implement driver training on interactions with passengers, a zero-tolerance policy for drivers, sexual harassment education and training, and a more adequate system to encourage customer reporting and monitor customer complaints.\nAre Uber\u2019s in-app safety features working?\nAbrams argues that Uber\u2019s safety features are insufficient because they\u2019re all app-based and only potentially useful if a rider has access to their own phone.\n\u201cThe majority of clients I represent and the women I\u2019ve spoken to who have been sexually assaulted have experienced: (A) someone else ordered the ride for them; (B) their phone is dead or they can\u2019t locate their phone to use the safety shield; or (C) if they could use their phone, they\u2019re incapacitated,\u201d said Abrams.\nThe lawyer says she has interviewed upward of 5,000 survivors over the course of several years and has seen no difference in the number of attacks before or after implementation of these in-app features.\nUber hasn\u2019t released safety data for 2021 and 2022, and won\u2019t say when it plans to do so. Older data backs up some of Abrams\u2019 claims.\nUber has published two safety reports \u2014 one containing data from 2017 to 2018 and another with data from 2019 to 2020. The ride-hail company claims that the rate of sexual assault reported on the app decreased 38% between its first and second reports.\nWhile the rate decrease is positive, not all the data delivers the same message. Over that same time period, the total number of sexual assault reports across five categories fell from 5,981 to 3,824. That drop could be explained by the decrease of trips from 1.4 billion in 2019 to 650 million in 2020.\nAnd while the total number of incidents as a percentage of total number of rides does decrease through the years, the number of incidents in certain categories actually increases. The number of incidents increased in the categories of nonconsensual kissing, nonconsensual touching and nonconsensual penetration, or rape, between 2017 and 2019.\nThe total number of rape incidents also rose from 2017 to 2019. And while the number of reported rapes dropped in 2020, the rate has remained the same since 2017. In other words, there has not been an improvement in the rate of rapes on the platform.\nSexual assaults are an ongoing problem for Uber\nUber has been sued numerous times over the past few years by passengers who claim they were sexually assaulted during a ride. Lyft has faced similar lawsuits and accusations.\nUnder Uber\u2019s terms of use, class action lawsuits can\u2019t be filed against the company in cases of sexual assault, so each case has to be heard individually. This has prevented survivors from advocating for themselves collectively.\nJudge Charles Breyer in the Northern District of California will preside over pretrial hearings. This will be the first time a federal judge is able to make decisions for a large amount of these cases, which will streamline the proceedings. Breyer may preside over the trials depending on whether the parties agree. If the parties do not agree to have Judge Breyer preside of the case for trial, the cases go back to their home jurisdiction for trial.\nAnother consolidated lawsuit has also been filed against Uber in California, but it only covers survivors in that state.\nUber has attempted, through several filings for motions to dismiss, to stop the consolidation of these cases. It argues that the company did not owe a duty to the plaintiffs to protect against criminal conduct. Lawyers representing the survivors will have to prove that Uber owed a duty of care to passengers, including the duty of taking reasonable precautions to ensure their safety.\nThe pretrial matters, including witness and expert depositions and document discovery, will be heard by Judge Charles Breyer. Abrams expects the timeline of the proceedings to last over the next one to two years.\n\nThis article, authored by Rebecca Bellan, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-13 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":367}

You can use that information to your advantage for both pre-game and live wagers.\nSimilar categories of moneylines, spreads, totals, and NBA prop bets should appear across both formats.\nThe NBA is also special because of the number of bets available for every game, ranging from pre-game to live betting and parlays.\nWhen you add up the standard bets, game props, player props, in-game betting, and more, there\u2019s a staggering volume of bets for every NBA game at online sportsbooks.\nSee more: Best NCAA basketball betting sites\n2023-24 NBA Season\nOctober 24 Regular season begins November 3 - December 9 In-season tournament February 16-18 All-Star Weekend 2024 April 14 Regular season ends April 16-19 Play-in tournament April 20 Playoffs begin June 6 NBA Finals Game 1\nNBA spreads, money lines, and over\/unders\nFor anyone new to NBA betting, the staple wager types are:\nNBA point spreads: Bet on games via margins of victory or loss. Say the New York Knicks are -7.5 favorites over the Miami Heat. That means the Knicks need to win the game by 8 points to win a spread bet. On the other hand, the Heat can lose by up to 7 points (or win outright).\nNBA moneylines: The simplest form of betting. You pick the winner of the game, and if you\u2019re right, you\u2019ll get paid out based on the odds when you finalize your bet slip. Favorites to win the game are shown negative odds, such as -135, while the underdogs will have positive odds, like +165.\nNBA over\/under bets: Also known as totals. These bets are focused on the combined point total of the two teams playing in a game. (Winners and losers don\u2019t matter.) For example, the over\/under could be set at 211.5 points in the Knicks vs. Heat matchup. If you were to pick the over on the bet, you\u2019d need the two teams to combine for 212 points or more to win. They need to score 211 points or fewer if you went with the under.\nNBA props and futures\nNBA player and team props are growing in popularity. Sportsbooks are taking note and providing more NBA props than ever.\nAfter all, it\u2019s much easier to focus on a single player and how he will perform than the entire team. Player props could focus on how many points a player scores or how many rebounds he pulls down. These are typically provided in an over\/under format.\nThen, team props can range from which team will score the first bucket to the total points scored in a quarter to which team will lead at halftime. The selection is often robust, especially when high-profile teams play.\nFutures bets are exactly what their name implies: bets on events that will happen in the future. Common futures markets include:\nand much more. You can usually bet on NBA futures odds throughout the year, including well before the season starts and throughout the regular season. The further away from the event, the more likely you will find heavier odds in your favor.\nIs NBA betting legal in the U.S.?\nIn the US, the landscape of sports betting, specifically NBA betting, has evolved considerably. While NBA betting is permitted, its legality varies across the nation. The significant turning point came in 2018 when the US Supreme Court made a pivotal decision. It overturned a longstanding federal law and allowed individual states the autonomy to determine their own sports betting regulations.\nThis groundbreaking decision sparked a wave of change. Since that landmark ruling, over 30 states have embraced sports betting, including wagers on the NBA. For those residing or visiting betting-friendly states, the experience promises fairness and security.\nState-regulated online betting platforms are in place, ensuring that bettors receive fair odds. Furthermore, these platforms adhere to strict standards, ensuring a safe and transparent betting environment for everyone involved.\nRelated Pages:\n\nThis article, authored by Sam Eggleston, was published by Sporting News on 2023-10-02 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":368}
{"title":"Here are the best deals on headphones and wireless earbuds we could find","context":"## Here are the best deals on headphones and wireless earbuds we could find\n\nWhen it comes to headphones and true wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. However, the sheer range of available models can also make them difficult to shop for, especially since many of them cater to different lifestyles, budgets, and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights and vigorous workouts, for instance, while others let you tune out noise so you can focus better.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve curated a list of the best headphone and earbud deals available. Here, you\u2019ll find sales on all kinds of earbuds and over-ear headphones, all of which come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a buying decision, we\u2019ve put together guides to the best wireless earbuds and best noise-canceling headphones, which can help you determine which pair is right for you.\nBest Apple deals\nAirPods Pro (second-gen) deals\nIf you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the second-gen AirPods Pro are probably your best bet when it comes to wireless earbuds. In comparison to the base AirPods, the Pros offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS and a MagSafe-compatible charging case.\nIn 2022, Apple launched a new pair of AirPods Pro with improved sound quality and better noise cancellation. They also include onboard volume controls and a new MagSafe charging case, one that can beep if you ever misplace it thanks to its deeper Find My integration. The earbuds even come with an extra swappable tip for smaller ears.\nOne year later, Apple released the updated AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case. Along with USB-C support, the buds also offer an even more robust IP54 rating for water and sweat resistance. Plus, when paired with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, they support lossless audio.\nDuring Black Friday, we saw steep discounts on both versions of the latest AirPods Pro, with retailers taking up to $60 off. However, these deals have since disappeared, and you can only buy the AirPods Pro without USB-C for $189.99 in-store from the Micro Center. The second best discount is available at B&H Photo, where anybody can order the 2022 buds without USB-C for $229 ($20 off). The buds with USB-C support, meanwhile, are only $3 off at $237 from Amazon, Walmart, and B&H Photo\u2014 though Best Buy\u2019s Plus and Total members can save $12.50.\nAirPods (second-gen) deals\nAlternatively, you can buy a pair of the second-gen AirPods with a wired charging case. Their sound quality isn\u2019t quite up to par with newer models, however, they remain the cheapest Apple earbuds on the market and continue to pair seamlessly with a range of Apple products thanks to their built-in H1 chip. The entry-level AirPods normally retail for $129, but you can currently get them for $99 at Amazon and Walmart.\nThe second-gen AirPods are a lot harder to get ahold of with a MagSafe charging case, however, unless you\u2019re shopping for a used or refurbished pair of earbuds. Luckily, though, you can still buy them in new condition at Adorama for $119.99 ($30 off).\nAirPods (third-gen) deals\nLast on Apple\u2019s wireless earbuds block are the third-gen AirPods, which represent the latest iteration of the base model. They blend a bit of the AirPods Pro look with the hard plastic build of the second-gen model; they also offer IPX4 water resistance and improved sound quality over the latter, even if they are still lacking in the low end.\nRight now, you can buy the third-gen AirPods with either a MagSafe charging case or a Lightning-only charging case. The option with the wired charging case is on sale at Amazon for $164 ($5 off). You can also pick up the wireless earbuds with a MagSafe charging case from Staples and Costco (if you\u2019re a member) for $169.95, which is just $6 more and a better deal overall.\nAirPods Max deals\nIf you\u2019re looking for some of the best sound quality you can get in a pair of noise-canceling headphones, we recommend the AirPods Max. The headphones pair seamlessly with other Apple devices and sound superb, especially combined with Apple\u2019s spatial audio feature, which allows for a more immersive experience when listening to or watching compatible content. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t support lossless audio, but they do tout the best transparency mode of all the headphones on our list. They also boast incredible build quality thanks to a luxe design that opts for aluminum, steel, and fabric over plastic.\nWith an MSRP of $549, the AirPods Max are expensive, but they\u2019re often on sale for far less. Right now, for instance, the headphones are down to $479.99 ($70 off) at Amazon, albeit in select colors, as well as Best Buy.\nBest Beats deals\nBeats Studio Pro\nAfter six years, Apple-owned Beats replaced the Beats Studio 3 with the Beats Studio Pro earlier this year. The over-ears offer much better sound quality thanks to new features like support for lossless audio over USB-C. They also cancel noise out much better, while you can take advantage of iOS and Android features like Fast Pair and Google\u2019s Find My Device platform. The Beats Studio Pro normally go for $349.99, but right now they are on sale for $271.15 in blue at Amazon, while you can get them in other colors for $299.99 from Best Buy and Verizon.\nBeats Fit Pro deals\nThe Beats Fit Pro are the latest fitness earbuds from Apple and offer a sportier design and better sound than the first-gen AirPods Pro. The wing tips help to keep them in place when you\u2019re active, while also ensuring they remain comfortable over long listening sessions. Their functionality with Android phones is slightly limited, but if you use an iPhone, you get all the conveniences of Apple\u2019s H1 chip and deeper OS integration and connectivity. Their only real downside is that the included charging case is overly large and lacks wireless charging (which is more forgivable at lower price points).\nBest Sony deals\nSony WH-1000XM5\nThey aren\u2019t a huge departure from the previous model, but the Sony WH-1000XM5 are still our favorite pair of noise-canceling headphones. The XM5s improve on all of the features that made the XM4s so awesome by providing better active noise cancellation, improving the voice call quality, and boosting the overall sound of the already excellent headphones. While the lack of new features is a bit disappointing, the Sony XM5s remain one of our top recommendations for anyone looking for a premium pair of noise-canceling headphones.\nRight now you can buy the headphones for around $328 ($70 off) from B&H Photo, Best Buy, and Target.\nSony WH-1000XM4 deals\nThe WH-1000XM5\u2019s predecessor, Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM4, are still a terrific pair of headphones even if they\u2019re older. They offer excellent noise cancellation, good sound, and the ability to pair to two devices simultaneously. You can wear them for long periods as well, as their plush ear pads make them comfortable to wear for as long as you need. Frequent travelers will appreciate their ability to fold up much more compactly than Sony\u2019s newer model. They even last up to 30 hours on a single charge and charge via USB-C.\nSony LinkBuds deals\nThe Sony LinkBuds are a clear departure from conventional earbuds, one that uses an \u201copen-style\u201d donut-shaped design instead of the more typical silicone ear tips. This allows for better spatial awareness and, for some, a more comfortable fit. The LinkBuds also provide crisp sound quality and excellent voice call performance. (Though, as a result of their design, they aren\u2019t very practical in louder environments.) Possibly the coolest feature, though, are the controls, which allow you to tap the side of your head to control them instead of the earbud itself. They\u2019re certainly very Sony.\nNormally $179.99, you can currently get a pair of the LinkBuds for around $138 from Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and direct from Sony.\nSony LinkBuds S deals\nOne more intriguing pair of earbuds from Sony are the LinkBuds S, which don\u2019t look as peculiar as the regular LinkBuds but are some of the comfiest earbuds around. A big part of this is due to their lightweight build, which amounts to just 4.8 grams per bud. They also offer active noise cancellation and support for Sony\u2019s LDAC Bluetooth codec, which allows for higher-quality audio streaming. Normally $199.99, the LinkBuds S are on sale for around $148 at Amazon and Target.\nSony WH-CH720N deals\nIf you\u2019re looking for noise-canceling headphones for under $150, Sony\u2019s WH-CH720N might be worth a look. The budget-friendly headphones come with adjustable noise cancellation and are exceptionally light, which allows for a more comfortable fit. They also feature Bluetooth support and offer up to 35 hours of continuous playback on a single charge, though they lack support for Sony\u2019s higher-quality LDAC codec.\nThe headphones typically retail for $149, but right now, you can buy them in various colors for around $98 from Amazon, B&H Photo, and Best Buy.\nSony WH-CH720N $ 98 $ 150 35 % off $ 98 $ 98 $ 150 35 % off Sony\u2019s wireless headphones offer noise cancellation and up to 35 hours of battery life on a single charge. They also come in blue, white, and black. $98 at Amazon$100 at Best Buy\nSony WF-C700N deals\nThe WF-C700N are another pair of noise-canceling earbuds from Sony and are currently available for $89.99 from Amazon and Best Buy. They\u2019re an exceptionally comfortable pair of earbuds with decent sound quality and support for an array of useful software features, including Fast Pair support on Android as well as location-based sound settings. Admittedly, their noise cancellation doesn\u2019t truly drown out the world, but it does eliminate some sound. Voice call quality isn\u2019t particularly impressive, either, but if you just need an affordable pair of earbuds to help you tune out some noise, the WF-C700N should do just fine.\nBest Bose deals\nBose QuietComfort Headphones and Bose QuietComfort 45 deals\nEarlier this fall, Bose rehauled its lineup and replaced the Bose QuietComfort 45 with Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Headphones. With the new headphones, you can now adjust noise cancellation levels and set custom modes. The over-ears also now come in green.\nWe haven\u2019t tested Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Headphones, but our headphone reviewer Chris Welch says they\u2019re otherwise extremely similar to the QuietComfort 45. They\u2019re foldable, so you can easily carry them around with you, and exceptionally comfortable. Battery life sits at 24 hours as well, meaning you needn\u2019t worry about constantly having to charge them. The transparency mode comes in handy when you need to be more aware of your surroundings, like when you\u2019re about to cross the street.\nRight now, you can buy the newer Bose QuietComfort Headphones for $249 ($100 off) from Amazon, Best Buy, and Bose. Alternatively, you can pick up the Bose QuietComfort 45 for $229 ($100 off) from Amazon, Best Buy and Target.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones and Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 deals\nUnlike Bose\u2019s entry-level QuietComfort Headphones, the new Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones offer higher-quality Bluetooth codecs and an immersive audio mode \u2014 which is essentially Bose\u2019s version of spatial audio. They also improve upon the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 with a foldable design, better call quality, and more effective noise cancellation. Along with new physical controls, like a volume slider, the over-ears sport a new spatial audio listening mode, Plus, they boast improved call quality, which is saying something given Bose\u2019s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 were already exemplary in this respect.\nRight now, you can buy the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones for $379 ($50 off) from Amazon, Best Buy, and Bose. You can alternatively buy Bose\u2019s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 for $279 ($100 off) from Best Buy and Bose.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II deals\nBose also recently replaced the excellent Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II with the Bose QuietComfort Ultra wireless earbuds. When it comes to noise cancellation, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra outperform all other earbuds on the market. While the buds are very similar in design, fit, and sound to their predecessor, they now support immersive audio, better voice call quality, and new silicone stabilizer wings that are easier to apply. Sadly, however, they continue to lack multipoint support and don't come with a built-in wireless charging case.\nWe recently saw the Bose QuietComfort Ultra drop down to $249, but right now you can only buy the Bose QuietComfort Ultra for $279 ($20 off) from Amazon, Best Buy, and Bose. Alternatively, you can buy the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II for $199 ($80 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and direct from Bose.\nRead our reviews of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II.\nBest Google deals\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro deals\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro are another good pair of noise-canceling earbuds, particularly for Pixel phone owners. The wireless earbuds offer terrific sound quality and battery life, along with useful features like multipoint Bluetooth connectivity. If you own a Pixel phone, you\u2019ll also get access to exclusive features like head-tracking spatial audio and easy access to their settings menu.\nRight now, they\u2019re on sale for around $119.99 ($80 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.\nGoogle Pixel Buds A-Series deals\nGoogle also sells a cheaper pair of earbuds, the Google Pixel Buds A-Series. They offer good sound and voice call quality, along with perks like Google Assistant and an IPX4 rating for sweat and water resistance. Just bear in mind there are some tradeoffs when opting for a cheaper set of earbuds, as the A-Series lack noise cancellation, wireless charging, and are more prone to the occasional connection hiccup.\nAt the moment, you can pick them up on sale for $83.34 ($17 off) at Amazon, a far cry from their all-time low of $58.98.\nGoogle Pixel Buds A-Series $ 83 $ 100 17 % off $ 83 $ 83 $ 100 17 % off The Pixel Buds A-Series deliver good comfort, impressive audio quality, and hands-free Google Assistant voice controls for under $100. $83 at Amazon\nBest Samsung deals\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro deals\nSamsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from. Its most high-end pair, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, launched last year. They\u2019re a good option if you\u2019re an Android user or Samsung devotee who wants a pair of premium earbuds, with top-notch sound quality that\u2019s even better than their predecessor. Samsung Galaxy phone owners can also take advantage of higher bit rate audio, while everybody can enjoy good active noise cancellation and a relatively robust IPX7 sweat and water resistance.\nYou can currently buy the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro on sale for $169.99 ($60 off) at Amazon, B&H Photo, and Best Buy.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 2 deals\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds 2 are a good-sounding pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation, wireless charging, and a subtle design. Right now, the best price around is at Best Buy, where you can grab a pair for $89.99 ($60 off). You can also buy them for about $10 more from Amazon. Walmart, and Verizon. That\u2019s not a bad price for Samsung\u2019s entry-level buds, which hit above their weight class with noise cancellation and good audio quality.\nVerge Deals on X (formerly known as Twitter) \/ Join over 51,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals Follow us!\nBest Jabra deals\nJabra Elite 10 deals\nJabra\u2019s Elite 10 are the company\u2019s most premium pair of wireless earbuds.

At the same time, they continue to retain perks like wireless charging, multipoint Bluetooth support, and are IP57-rated for water resistance.\nRegularly $249.99, you can currently buy the Jabra Elite 10 for $199.99 from Amazon, Best Buy, and Jabra.\nJabra Elite 8 Active deals\nJabra\u2019s Elite 8 Active are a pair of fitness-focused earbuds and the successor to the excellent Elite 7 Active.

They may not boast physical controls or the stylish, retro-inspired design their predecessor had, but they do offer improved noise cancellation (even if it isn\u2019t quite on par with that of Sony or Bose\u2019s offerings).\nThe Momentum Wireless 4 typically sell for $379.95, but right now you can buy them for $269.89 at Amazon and for $30 more at Best Buy.\nBest UE deals\nUE Fits deals\nAfter testing a pair for ourselves, we remarked in our review that the UE Fits were the most comfortable consumer earbuds on the market. That\u2019s because, unlike the other wireless earbuds on this list, the UE Fits are uniquely capable of permanently molding to the shape of your ears in just 60 seconds, making them a great choice for those concerned their earbuds may come loose or fall out. We also found that they offer good sound quality, as well as lengthy, eight-hour battery life.

{"title":"Ten Hag\u2019s Manchester United stand up and die at club stuck in the past tense | Barney Ronay","context":"## Ten Hag\u2019s Manchester United stand up and die at club stuck in the past tense | Barney Ronay\n\nAs the seconds ticked down at the end of a Champions League season\u2011ender that felt like a gentle, even quite tender, act of sporting euthanasia, the only noise inside Old Trafford was the sound of the Bayern Munich fans singing an impressively sustained version of Football\u2019s Coming Home. A little later they sang Is This A Library? Actually, no, it\u2019s more of a museum. They chanted \u201cAuf Wiedersehen\u201d at the departing members of the home support who, frankly, had done pretty well to stick it out to that point.\nThe good news for Erik ten Hag at the end of this low-fi 1-0 defeat is that United\u2019s players didn\u2019t lie down and die at Old Trafford. Instead they stood up and died, running hard and creating a kind of simulacrum of a functioning elite team.\nThis was not a group of players in revolt or drained of spirit. They looked like what they are, a muddled creation, stitched together out of parts and off-cuts. In the second half United\u2019s back five was Andr\u00e9 Onana, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Jonny Evans, Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Diogo Dalot, an entirely random collection of players signed, at various times, by Ten Hag, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and Alex Ferguson. Presumably Daley Thompson, Michael Portillo and Howard from Take That were busy.\nBy the end United had five academy players on the pitch, ages ranged between 17 and 35, in outline evidence of internal good health, in reality another symptom of a machine that wants to function properly but has for so long been made to judder along at half-speed. Ever feel like you\u2019re starting to slip into the past tense for good? When VAR happens at Old Trafford there isn\u2019t even a VAR screen to say \u201cVAR Check\u201d. The 1990s were a hell of a decade. They still are around here.\n'We've lost decisive players': Ten Hag says injuries were key to Champions League exit \u2013 video\nSo much for the good news then. The bad news is that Ten Hag\u2019s United have now compiled arguably the worst performance by any English team in a Champions League group stage. OK, it\u2019s no Blackburn Rovers. But there are extra marks here for United\u2019s pedigree, for the fact the group really wasn\u2019t much of a group, and for United managing to finish bottom, shipping 15 goals in the process, more than any other English team ever.\nPlus of course there were just so many moments of farce along the way, a six-part saga of chaos, collapse and laughter in the dark. We remember Onana diving out of the way of the ball in Munich. We remember Onana also diving out of the way of the ball in Istanbul. Casemiro\u2019s red card, lost leads in Manchester, Marcus Rashford unfairly convicted of a venomous stamp in Copenhagen, when frankly, he\u2019s just not that kind of semi-interested footballer.\nAnd yet with both group games blank at half-time United were still just one goal away here from going through to the last 16, which really would have made for an excellent punchline. It wasn\u2019t to be. For all their own flaws Bayern are basically a good version of whatever it is United are attempting to piece together. Kimmich\u2011Goretzka\u2011Musiala is an A grade version of Amrabat\u2011McTominay\u2011Fernandes. Manuel Neuer is the thing Onana is trying so earnestly to be. Bayern actually did go ahead and sign Harry Kane.\nHarry Kane (centre) and his Bayern Munich teammates applaud fans after their Champions League victory at Old Trafford. Photograph: Adam Vaughan\/EPA\nThey held the ball nicely, probed in neat, clipped, mannered attacks. A lot seemed to hinge on how desperately Bayern felt the need to twist that scalpel, whether they could really be bothered to take this thing to the wall. United defended well. Their waves of pressing drew waves of applause. Everyone here seemed to be trying.\nBut with 58 minutes gone Copenhagen scored and United\u2019s hopes began to slip beneath the waves. Just over 10 minutes later Bayern made it 1-0 in Manchester. Kingsley Coman got it, granted a huge expanse of time and space in front of the United goal, enough to set himself, as though taking a penalty, and belt the ball into the corner. The moment was made by a delightfully sneaky round\u2011the\u2011corner pass from Kane. After all that pressure, all that tender hope, it looked a bit like a training goal.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From here United\u2019s season continues to narrow. They can\u2019t win the league now, can\u2019t win the Champions League, can\u2019t win the Carabao Cup. They still have the FA Cup, and the extended pursuit of fourth or even fifth place, although the state of the coefficient means the thing that might keep Manchester United out of Europe next season could be Manchester United being so bad in Europe this season. Maybe City can revive their fortunes by winning the Champions League again.\nTen Hag will take the blame of course for the early exit and plenty of mistakes have been made, not least in the players the manager has been allowed to sign. In reality assessing the job any United manager does with this team involves applying a series of filters. To be United manager is to undertake three concurrent roles.\nFirst you must manage the past, which is constantly in the room and which skews every act, achievement and expectation. Second you must manage the dysfunction of the present, which expresses itself in every detail from a leaking stadium roof to the deep ills of a playing squad peopled with squatters and long\u2011term missteps.\nFinally you get to manage the everyday metrics on which you will be judged; team, results, style, energy, messaging. Win things, improve players, create a coherent and happy internal culture: but do it during an unceasing takeover circus while star players sulk and brief against you, while the ghost of Hamlet\u2019s father still skulks in the eaves. This felt like the end of one thing, perhaps even the beginning of the end of something else.\n\nThis article, authored by Barney Ronay at Old Trafford, was published by The Guardian on 2023-12-12 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":370}
{"title":"West Indies clinch T20 series after Shai Hope edges hosts past England total","context":"## West Indies clinch T20 series after Shai Hope edges hosts past England total\n\nWhat a difference two days make. Somehow Tuesday\u2019s ludicrous, record-smashing, high-scoring entertainment was followed by a sequel on the same surface that eventually delivered thrilling low-scoring entertainment, and a different result claimed in very different style. It was eventually won for West Indies with four balls to spare and in the most unfitting of ways \u2013 with a massive six \u2013 by Shai Hope, again proving himself the right man for a run-chase.\nSo a series marked by stunning power hitting, roaring run rates and an unexpected midway transformation in England\u2019s performances and prospects concluded with a 3-2 triumph for West Indies, who extended their supremacy over England at home to four series in three formats across nearly five years.\nEngland assembled exactly the same players in exactly the same place and exactly the same situation \u2013 losing the toss, put in to bat \u2013 but this was an entirely different performance. A wicket once so true turned untrustworthy and they struggled to a score of 132, less than half the 267 to which they had joyously motored just 48 hours previously. And though the home side\u2019s response was anything but overwhelming, neither was the result ever in significant doubt.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some high-scoring games, but the last game was almost the complete opposite of what happened here,\u201d Reece Topley said. \u201cWe were probably just under par with the first-innings score but with the ball we were excellent, pushed them right to the end. I think it\u2019s been an amazing series. Both teams have played some unbelievable cricket. I was so excited turning up today, because it was basically a final and those are the games you want to play in and be on the right side of. The bottom line is you want to win this series, I want to win every series I can for England.\u201d\nOften there is a sense as a tour enters its final days of thoughts turning to home, and perhaps the focus was not as laser-sharp as it might have been for this game, determination less than absolute to grasp this opportunity to end England\u2019s run of reverses in the Caribbean. Whatever the reason, the pyrotechnics that rocketed England to victory in the two previous matches never sparked in this one. It took a fabulous delivery from Gudakesh Motie to end Phil Salt\u2019s run of absurd form with his score a modest 38, but some of the other wickets that fell during the period that defined England\u2019s innings and the game seemed a little careless.\nIn the fourth over Jos Buttler casually turned a Jason Holder delivery to fine leg, where Oshane Thomas was positioned, hands cupped. Harry Brook tried to paddle-sweep Motie but sent the ball only a few feet into the air, giving Nicholas Pooran an easy catch. That made it 70 for four and the game was one ball into its ninth over, at which point Liam Livingstone and Moeen Ali had to focus for a while on disaster prevention rather than entertainment.\nGudakesh Motie is embraced his his West Indies teammates after dismissing England\u2019s in-form Phil Salt. Photograph: Randy Brooks\/AFP\/Getty Images\nSuddenly bowlers were energised by the prospect of posting, for a change, less-than-humiliating figures. Akeal Hosein\u2019s were outstanding, his four overs going for just 20 and bringing the wickets of Will Jacks and Moeen, undone by a relay catch on the boundary after combining with Livingstone to add 40 for the fifth wicket. Livingstone followed precisely two overs later, prodding the ball limply back into the hands of Motie, at which point things really fell apart, the last five wickets surrendered in 20 balls for just 11 runs.\nJust as surely as when they came out on Tuesday facing an almost unachievable task, the outcome of the West Indies\u2019 run chase seemed inevitable from the start. With such a meagre target they needed little more than to keep their heads, and though both Topley and Sam Curran conceded only two with their final overs to push the contest into its final over, that never looked in doubt.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week\u2019s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was a trap which, thanks to Hope\u2019s 43-ball 43 as he again steered his side to their target, West Indies avoided. This batting display may have lacked their usual flamboyance but until the final ball it was entirely appropriate for the occasion.\nAmid the wider theme of transformation Adil Rashid\u2019s excellence remains constant. The 35-year-old, who rose to the top of the T20 bowling rankings for the first time on Wednesday, took two wickets and conceded just 21 while Topley was even better, also claiming a pair of victims but conceding only 17. England take plenty of positives from this series, but the result was not one.\n\nThis article, authored by Simon Burnton at the Brian Lara Stadium, was published by The Guardian on 2023-12-21 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":371}
{"title":"Sources: Palo Alto in advanced talks to buy Talon and Dig in a $1B security sweep","context":"## Sources: Palo Alto in advanced talks to buy Talon and Dig in a $1B security sweep\n\nPalo Alto Networks\u2019 stock price has been on the rise on the back of strong earnings and growing demand for cybersecurity services, and now the company is using that momentum to do a little shopping.\nTechCrunch has confirmed with multiple sources that Palo Alto is in advanced negotiations to buy not one, but two, security startups out of Israel for around $1 billion altogether to expand its portfolio of services.\nSpecifically, it is looking at Talon Cyber Security \u2014 which has developed an enterprise browser aimed at security distributed workforces \u2014 for between $600 million and $700 million; and Dig Security \u2014 a specialist in securing data across public clouds \u2014 for between $300 million and $400 million. Palo Alto is publicly traded and currently has a market cap of close to $70 billion.\nBoth startups are less than three years old, and in both cases these would be strong outcomes compared to their existing valuations.\nTalon has raised around $143 million, and Dig has raised only around $45 million. Respectively, their investors include Entr\u00e9e Capital, Evolution Equity and LightSpeed; and Signal Fire, Okta, CrowdStrike, Samsung and Felicis. The two share common investors, too: the cybersecurity specialist investors Team8 and Cyverse Capital.\nFrom what I understand, Palo Alto approached both startups proactively: neither was in the market to be acquired.\nPalo Alto Networks and Dig declined to comment for this story; Talon has yet to respond to us. But multiple sources close to the deal contacted by TechCrunch have confirmed the prices and said that the negotiations are in an advanced phase \u2014 although not closed.\nFor another steer on the deals in progress, Israeli publication Calcalist has in the past week reported on both of the deals with the same figures we\u2019ve been hearing (here and here).\nThe deals underscore some key trends playing out in the cybersecurity industry right now.\nFirst and foremost, security continues to be a huge priority for enterprises and smaller businesses.\nA McKinsey report from last year notes that breaches are on track to collectively cost $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, a 300% increase on 2015 figures. While a lot of companies have clamped down on spending and IT budgets over the last couple years, security is one area where they have returned to spending even when other categories have remained frozen or constrained.\n\u201cFor end customers, security is still a big business risk, so budgets are back in action and we\u2019re seeing sales picking up in Q3 and Q4,\u201d one source said. \u201cSecurity companies will want to tap into this opportunity aggressively.\u201d\nSecond, cybersecurity remains a moving target. Malicious hackers are turning to technologies like AI to break into networks, so, as smaller startups come up with new cyber techniques themselves, they become acquisition targets for larger companies looking to stay ahead of the curve.\nOther examples of this include CrowdStrike acquiring security startup Bionic for $350 million, and IBM buying Polar earlier this year for $60 million \u2014 a deal IBM made, we understand, partly in response to Palo Alto buying Cider Security in 2022.\nThere are mega deals in this trend, too, such as Cisco\u2019s plan to buy Splunk for $28 billion.\nFor security companies, it becomes a question of competitive edge both against malicious hackers and other security companies. \u201cPalo Alto is buying partly in reaction to these deals,\u201d one source said. Some Palo Alto competitors like Wiz, now valued at $10 billion, are also a part of that competitive threat.\nBoth Talon and Dig are working in newer areas of the security market, which would make them especially attractive to a larger acquirer. (We understand that there appeared to be others previously looking at both.)\nDig\u2019s efforts in securing data in the cloud, working across fragmented data across multiple clouds, taps into a growing area of the market \u2014 cloud spend is one of the only other areas where budgets are not being curtailed right now. It\u2019s a very crowded field, but also a prime opportunity to emerge as a leader in matching solutions to how companies are actually working in the real world.\nIn contrast, Talon\u2019s focus on the concept of an enterprise browser \u2014 a platform for large organizations to operate all of their apps and services, built from the ground up with security in mind \u2014 is still relatively new in the market, but it has already started to catch on big with customers and competitors (Island is another company in the same space, so that\u2019s another one to watch).\n\u201cThey\u2019re creating a new category that has the potential of being bigger than endpoint security altogether,\u201d one source said. \u201cThey\u2019re reinventing the operating system.\u201d\nIn the world of IT, the pendulum definitely swings between giant all-in-one platforms and customers opting for best-in-class point solutions. These days in cybersecurity, considering the number of acquisitions we keep hearing about, the swing definitely seems to be in the direction of large platforms, and that is playing out here with these two deals in the works. The big question is how well those doing the buying are digesting these companies and how that gets presented to end users.\nA source tells us that customers that are parting ways with Palo Alto these days are doing so in part because \u201cthey feel like the product is disconnected\u201d \u2014 the company has more than 30 products and services now, and it\u2019s made 17 acquisitions in total. If these two close, the question will be how Palo Alto Networks\u2019 CEO Nikesh Arora plans to present a holistic view of tackling what remains a very fragmented and dangerous threat landscape.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-09-26 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":372}
{"title":"Check Point sees 'fantastic' year ahead even as rival report disappointing billings","context":"## Check Point sees 'fantastic' year ahead even as rival report disappointing billings\n\nThe financial damage from cybercrimes will reach an astronomical $10.5 trillion by 2025. As global economies go, that would rank third behind only the U.S. and China.\nBut what\u2019s bad for global conglomerates and the average person could be an opportunity for cybersecurity firms like Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP).\nEven as rivals like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) cite an uncertain macroeconomic environment for weak billings forecasts, the need for cybersecurity is clearly growing. Global cybercrime damage costs are expected to increase 15% annually over the next two years, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time to be in cyber,\u201d Check Point (CHKP) President Rupal Shah Hollenbeck said in a Zoom interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s fortunate in that organizations are understanding the business value of cybersecurity in a really big way. Unfortunately, it\u2019s because there are more hacks out there than ever before.\u201d\nFinancials\nSales at Check Point (CHKP) have grown on a yearly basis amid the increase in demand. For the most recently reported quarter, non-GAAP earnings of $2.07 per share beat the average analyst estimate by 5 cents, while revenue of $596.3M beat by $3.78M.\nThat resulted in an upgrade late last month at Piper Sandler with signs of recovery on the horizon.\nThe demand for cybersecurity is strong, but companies are not immune to the realities of the global economy.\nThis week, rival Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) lowered its billings forecast for the fiscal year, citing the cost of money which has remained a constant discussion with and focus for customers.\nIt said it is constantly discussing payments in its annual billings plans, which can create variability on total billings more than before depending on financing used or the duration of contracts. Palo Alto (PANW) said it nonetheless sees demand for its products.\nEarlier this month, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) got a slew of analyst downgrades over a disappointing fourth-quarter outlook.\nThe near- to medium-term is uncertain after disappointing results, Cantor Fitzgerald said. Stifel, which likes the company, said moving parts will take time to play out and shares are expected trade sideways in coming quarters.\nThe future\nCheck Point (CHKP) has made three recent acquisitions to expand its offerings.\nIt has also invested in R&D and launched new products, like the Rugged Industrial Control Systems Gateway, which provides artificial intelligence security and deployments in harsh environments. Other new offerings include Playblocks, which extends the reach of siloed security systems to stop attacks across products, people and processes.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to work at it on the go-to-market side, but I feel that all the ingredients are in place and, dare I say it, I think 2024 can be a really fantastic year for us,\u201d Hollenbeck said, adding the company has increased headcount over the past year including a 25% rise in its salesforce.\nHollenbeck said the company welcomes competition, as they \"bring out the best of innovation for customers.\" The executive spent more than two decades at Intel (INTC) working in Singapore and Beijing, among other places.\nCheck Point (CHKP) ended the most recent quarter with $3B in cash, which could open the door to additional acquisitions, though Hollenbeck declined to cite specifics.\nWomen\nHollenbeck has led the company for almost two years, one of the few C-suite level women in tech. Nearly 17% of tech companies currently have a woman serving as CEO, according to AnitaB.org, which supports women in computing and tech.\nHollenbeck is a seasoned executive: after Intel (INTC), she spent time at Oracle (ORCL) and is on the board of Neythri Futures Fund, which invests in female founders tapping into a growing base of South Asian female leaders. Although she\u2019s been in tech for nearly 30 years, it hasn\u2019t gotten easier to be a woman in a male-dominated industry.\nAt most tech events, \"there's never a line [outside] of the lady's room,\u201d Hollenbeck said. \u201cI think it's gotten materially better, but it's only gotten materially better because we started from such a low point.\u201d\nHollenbeck is proud that four of the top executives at Check Point (CHKP) are women and three women are on the board.\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d she said, pointing to data that shows the more women in leadership roles, the better they perform. According to McKinsey, companies that improved women\u2019s representation outperformed their industry from 2019 to 2022 when compared to other companies with data from the same time period.\n\u201cWhen there is gender parity of the board, that company tends to perform higher than the average,\u201d she said. The question is \u201cwhy is it the best kept secret and why aren\u2019t organizations responding to this faster and better?\u201d\nWar\nLike many companies in Israel, Tel Aviv-based Check Point (CHKP) has been impacted by the war, as Hollenbeck said some of its employees have been killed and others have been called to serve.\nHowever, she stressed operations are normal and business is continuing as usual. Check Point (CHK) has levels of redundancy around the world and research and development happening in several locations, she said.\nIn addition, the company\u2019s supply chain is 100% outside of Israel and tech support centers and data centers are found around the world.\n\"We have the right level of redundancies and business continuity plans in place around the world,\" Hollenbeck said. \"So we're okay.\"\n\nThis article was published by Seeking Alpha on 2023-11-18 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":373}

He appeared in a Seattle federal court on Tuesday to enter his plea.\nRichard Teng, Binance\u2019s former global head of regional markets, will be the exchange\u2019s new CEO, Zhao shared in a post on X Tuesday afternoon. Teng previously was the CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, among other executive roles. In response to stepping down, Zhao said, \u201cit is the right thing to do\u201d adding, \u201cI made mistakes, and I must take responsibility.\u201d Zhao will remain a shareholder and said he will be \u201cavailable to the team to consult as needed.\u201d\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, has also agreed to pay about $4.3 billion to resolve the DOJ\u2019s investigations, the agency said in a press release on Tuesday.\nAs a part of Binance\u2019s guilty plea, it has also reached agreements with the Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and will credit about $1.8 billion toward those resolutions.\nThe crypto exchange \u201cadmits it engaged in anti-money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations,\u201d the DOJ release stated, calling it the \u201clargest corporate resolution\u201d that included criminal charges for an executive. Zhao pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an anti-money laundering program.\n\u201cThe message here should be clear: using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor, it makes you a criminal,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.\nBinance, Zhao and other related parties \u201cknowingly failed to register as a money services business\u201d and violated the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement an anti-money laundering program, a filing on the charges stated. It added that the respective parties allegedly violated U.S. economic sanctions \u201cin a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the U.S. market,\u201d without following U.S. laws.\nThe crypto exchange collected about $1.35 billion in trading fees from U.S. customers, according to Chairman Rostin Behnam of the CFTC. According to court documents, Zhao told Binance employees it was \u201cbetter to ask for forgiveness than permission\u201d and prioritized the exchange\u2019s growth there over complying with U.S. law.\n\u201cAny institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime or face the consequences,\u201d Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen said in the release.\nUnder Zhao\u2019s plea agreement, he will agree to the recommendation that the court impose a $150 million fine to the CFTC and won\u2019t make any statements \u201ccontradicting his acceptance of responsibility,\u201d according to a separate filing from Monday.\nAs for Binance\u2019s plea agreement, the company will accept the resignation of Zhao and prohibit him \u201cfrom any present or future involvement in operating\u201d the business from the beginning of the plea acceptance and \u201cends three years from the date a monitor is appointed,\u201d the Monday filing stated. The company will also \u201cmaintain and enhance\u201d its compliance program and appoint an independent compliance monitor during that three year period.\nThe crypto exchange did not respond to multiple requests for comment from TechCrunch on the charges.\nBinance launched in June 2017 and within 180 days became the largest crypto exchange in the world. It had over $12.65 billion in trading volume during the past 24-hours, 532% higher than $2 billion in trading volume from the second largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, according to CoinMarketCap data.\nThis comes less than a day after the SEC charged Kraken, the third largest crypto exchange by trading volume, with allegedly operating as an \u201cunregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer and clearing agency.\u201d\nSeparately, in February, Kraken agreed to end crypto staking services for U.S. clients and settled a past suit with the SEC after agreeing to pay $30 million in charges for \u201cdisgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties.\u201d\nThe DOJ charges against Binance come over five months after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the exchange and Zhao of lying to regulators about its operations, filing 13 charges against the defendants in the federal case. Zhao and Binance were allegedly \u201cintimately involved\u201d in directing the trading entity\u2019s business operations and providing crypto-related services to the Binance.US platform, which claims it\u2019s an independent exchange in the SEC filing.\nIn late March the U.S. CFTC also filed a suit against Binance, Zhao and its Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim for allegedly breaking trading and derivatives rules.\nBinance has made headlines this past year for a range of reasons, including Zhao\u2019s comments contributing to the collapse of FTX, which was once one of its top competitors. In April, Binance.US, its American sister company, broke off its $1.3 billion deal to buy crypto broker Voyager Digital\u2019s assets due to a \u201chostile and uncertain regulatory climate.\u201d\nIn August, Checkout.com cut ties with Binance over concerns about the crypto firm\u2019s alleged issues with anti-money laundering, sanctions and compliance controls.

{"title":"Coinbase rallies more than 60% in same month that FTX and Binance founders brace for prison","context":"## Coinbase rallies more than 60% in same month that FTX and Binance founders brace for prison\n\nIn this article COIN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nBrian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, slammed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He also said the cryptocurrency exchange is looking to invest more outside of the U.S. Carlos Jasso | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nIn a month that saw two of the crypto industry's leading figures headed on the path to prison, Coinbase shares rocketed more than 60%, their second-best monthly performance since the cryptocurrency exchange went public in 2021. Bolstered by rallies in bitcoin and ether as well as crises at key competitors, Coinbase has been one of Wall Street's best bets all year, climbing more than 250% in the first 11 months of 2023. For early holders of the stock, the rebound helps ease the pain of 2022, when Coinbase lost 86% of its value as soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of crypto and high-growth tech companies, and into assets deemed safer in a recession. Tech stocks have roared back this year, particularly those tied to the artificial intelligence boom and crypto. Coinbase has the added benefit of having survived the so-called crypto winter, while so many of its rivals disappeared or downsized. The industry fallout came to a head this month, when Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of former Coinbase rival FTX, was found guilty of seven criminal fraud counts tied to the collapse of his exchange and the theft of customer funds. His conviction landed on Nov. 2 after a monthlong trial. Less than three weeks later, on Nov. 21, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program and for willfully violating U.S. economic sanctions.\nCombination showing Former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (L) and Zhao Changpeng (R), founder and chief executive officer of Binance. Getty Images | Reuters\nBankman-Fried, who faces potential life behind bars, is scheduled to be sentenced in March. Zhao's sentencing is set for February. While guidelines suggest a sentence of 12 to 18 months, the Justice Department could push for a lengthier punishment for the Binance founder. Unlike FTX, which filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, Binance is still standing, though now without Zhao, who agreed to step down as CEO as part of the plea deal. Even before that, the company was seeing a plunge in trading, with volume down by two-thirds between the first and third quarters of the year, according to crypto analyst site CoinGecko. With assets of more than $65 billion on the platform, Binance remains the world's largest crypto exchange globally. But its market share fell from over 60% in February to under 50% in September, \"an indication that the exchange may be losing its grip on the industry as regulators continue to pressure it,\" CoinGecko said. In the first 24 hours after the Justice Department announced its $4.3 billion settlement with Binance, customers pulled more than $1 billion from the exchange. Liquidity also dropped 25% in the immediate aftermath of the announcement as market makers pulled back their positions, according to data provider Kaiko. A Binance spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that Zhao appeared in court \"to protect our users and to ensure the longevity of our company.\" \"Binance's resilience has been tested unlike any other exchange around today,\" the spokesperson said. \"Yet, we continue to operate the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. In fact, we currently see a climbing percentage of institutional user transactions.\" Coinbase is the fourth-biggest global exchange by daily volume, according to CoinGecko. It's the only one that's publicly traded in the U.S. and has a market cap of close $30 billion. In a report to clients on Wednesday, analysts at Mizuho noted that Coinbase shares are up about 20% since Zhao's settlement, a rally that's likely \"in anticipation of potential share gains for COIN in wake of outflows from Binance, the industry's largest exchange,\" they wrote. Coinbase shares fell 2.4% to $124.72 on Thursday, wiping out some of their recent gains. Mizuho raised its price target on the stock to $35 from $31, while keeping its underperform rating, which it's maintained since December.\n'Turn the page'\nA Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment for this story, but CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche earlier this week that the Binance settlement allows the crypto industry to move past a spate of scandals. \"The enforcement action against Binance, that's allowing us to kind of turn the page on that and hopefully close that chapter of history,\" Armstrong said. \"I think that regulatory clarity is going to help bring in more investment, especially from institutions.\"\nwatch now\nBoth Coinbase and Binance still face legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was noticeably absent from the Binance settlement. Meanwhile, Coinbase executives have floated the idea of leaving the U.S. altogether for a jurisdiction with hard-and-fast rules on crypto, should the company be unable to come to a resolution with the SEC. Wall Street appears to be shrugging off that concern. Analysts at Needham, who recommend buying Coinbase shares, wrote in a report on Nov. 21 that the company \"exited the crypto 'winter' better positioned than in the prior up cycle.\" They also noted that in addition to FTX's failure and Binance's retreat, crypto trading platform Bittrex has also exited the market. Bittrex said on Nov. 20, that effective Dec. 4, \"all trading activity on Bittrex Global will be disabled,\" and it encouraged customers \"to log into their account and withdraw assets as soon as possible.\" In April, the SEC charged Bittrex and its ex-CEO with operating an unregistered exchange. Yet there may be a new competitive threat on the horizon. U.S. regulators are expected to soon approve the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which would allow investors to buy into digital currency directly through the same mechanism they use to buy stock and bond ETFs. Top asset managers, including BlackRock , WisdomTree and Invesco, have filed applications with the SEC. Regulatory approval would open up many more avenues for people to buy bitcoin. While Coinbase allows investors to buy a variety of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin accounted for 38% of transaction volume in the third quarter and almost the same percentage of revenue. For casual investors who just want some exposure to bitcoin, there will potentially be additional ways to buy, including through their primary online brokerage. JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote last week that crypto ETFs would likely be good for Coinbase in the short term but more problematic as time passes. The initial boost would come from custody revenue tied to the ETFs. Most of the big asset managers jumping into market, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree, have picked Coinbase for custody services, which involves the storage and safekeeping of the assets. However, the longer-term concern, according to JPMorgan, is that fewer people will need Coinbase accounts, leading to pricing pressure. \"We see many novice investors never going beyond these flagship tokens and thus never needing the services of a Coinbase,\" wrote the analysts, who have a neutral rating on the stock and an $80 price target. \"We also see the ETF markets as more transparent, efficient and lower cost to execute and we see the potential for a migration to ETFs for cheaper exposure and trading driving Coinbase to lower fees.\" WATCH: Former SEC enforcement chief on 'casualness' in crypto compliance\n\nThis article was published by Cnbc | World Business News Leader on 2023-11-30 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":375}
{"title":"Bills vs. Chargers odds, props, predictions: Buffalo faces struggling L.A. with eyes on AFC playoff picture","context":"## Bills vs. Chargers odds, props, predictions: Buffalo faces struggling L.A. with eyes on AFC playoff picture\n\nThe Buffalo Bills (8-6) will be the first foes Los Angeles Chargers (5-9) interim head coach Giff Smith will face when the teams meet at SoFi Stadium in this Week 16 Saturday matchup. The Bills enter QB Josh Allen\u2019s home state as 12-point favorites with the OVER\/UNDER set at 44.\nThis game features one team heating up and looking like a unit no one will want to face in the playoffs, while the other is sifting through the rubble of a disastrous 2023 season and building for 2024 and beyond.\nBuffalo is in the thick of the AFC wild card hunt, trailing three other 8-6 teams (Bengals, Colts, Texans) by tiebreakers going into this week. They\u2019re also riding high on the heels of their dominant 31-10 Week 15 home win over the Cowboys, led by RB James Cook\u2019s 25-179-1 rushing bonanza. While Buffalo has had their ups and downs this year, if they make the postseason with their rushing game producing like this they will be an extremely tough out.\nThe Chargers are coming off a brutal 63-21 Thursday Night Football rout at the hands of the Raiders, which led to Los Angeles firing head coach Brandon Staley and GM Tom Telesco. Los Angeles was already twisting in the wind after QB Justin Herbert\u2019s season-ending hand injury, but the magnitude of their 38-point loss last week was embarrassing enough to cause the team to clean house midseason.\nBetting odds for Bills vs. Chargers: Point spread, moneyline, total for Week 16 Saturday\nHere are the latest NFL betting odds for Bills vs. Chargers:\nMore NFL wagering: Top 5 NFL betting sites | Best NFL betting promos and bonuses\nBills betting news: Buffalo aims to continue hot streak ATS\nBuffalo is 6-7-1 ATS in 2023, and to say this team is streaky in this regard would be an understatement. The Bills went 3-1 ATS in their first four, but that ride on the gravy train was interrupted by what came next: a brutal six-game stretch between Weeks 5-10 where they failed to cover once.\nThe Bills appear to have moved past their midseason ATS doldrums, riding a 3-0-1 streak into Week 16.\nWe often see several versions and levels of a team throughout the year, and with the Bills it largely boils down to their ground game. Ty Johnson and Latavius Murray are serviceable RBs but lack the game-breaking speed and big play ability that James Cook offers.\nBefore Week 15, Cook hadn\u2019t rushed more than 17 times in a game. After carrying 25 times vs. Dallas (and earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week status), BIlls fans must be extremely hopeful that their offensive attack continues to involve Cook handling more than 20 rushes per game.\nCook\u2019s 179-yard outburst coupled with backup Ty Johnson\u2019s shoulder injury in Week 15 should both contribute to Cook garnering 20-plus touches this week.\nChargers betting news: Los Angeles limps toward the finish line\nThe Chargers were supposed to be good but are not. It seemed unlikely that coach Brandon Staley was going to be their guy past this year, especially on the heels of their crushing playoff exit in Jacksonville where they blew a 27-point lead and lost in historic fashion. However, giving up 63 points to a team that had just been shut out 3-0 four days earlier was enough to cause Los Angeles ownership to hit the shred button.\nThey\u2019re 4-9-1 ATS and have failed to cover in five of their last six games. Given what we saw from the team while being shredded so badly on TNF last week, it\u2019s going to take some big spreads and some sort of spark from their interim head coach Giff Smith for them to cover anything the rest of the way this season.\nJustin Herbert\u2019s replacement, Easton Stick, amassed an impressive line of 23-for-32 for 257 yards passing and a TD in Week 15, but he also had fumble and interception returns against him within about 25 seconds between the end of the third quarter and the start of the fourth.\nBetting on or against QBs that nobody has seen play can be tricky, but focusing on OVER\/UNDER betting trends for the Chargers is not. Los Angeles has gone under in 10 of their 12 games, which would make you think they\u2019re likely to keep doing so the rest of 2023.\nHowever, the OVER\/UNDER resting at 44 this week seems tantalizingly low. Buffalo has averaged 29 PPG in their last four, and with Stick throwing TDs but also turning the ball over at a high rate, that figure might be easily surpassed.\nBill vs. Chargers props\nTwo props for the Bills vs. Chargers Week 16 game worth considering:\nDalton Kincaid UNDER receptions\nKincaid was a limited participant in practice on Wednesday due to a shoulder injury, but it\u2019s been reported he\u2019s likely to suit up on Saturday at less than 100%. This prop suggestion centers completely on the inference that Kincaid suits up but takes part in less packages and plays than usual. With Buffalo likely to cruise, this isn\u2019t a far-fetched chain of events to target.\nGerald Everett OVER receiving yards\nWhether Easton Stick continues to play decently or if he doesn\u2019t, this prop line for receiving yards should be attainable for Chargers TE Gerald Everett in Week 16. Everett has tallied 41, 39, 44 and 43 receiving yards in his last four outings. The Bills are likely to score a lot, necessitating that Los Angeles passes a lot. Even if this wasn\u2019t a game with such a big spread, it is a small ask to suggest that Everett can net half of what he\u2019s averaged in the past month.\nBills vs. Chargers prediction: Bills continue to roll\nThe Chargers new coach isn\u2019t going to be able to right all his team\u2019s wrongs overnight, but losing by less than 38 would be a great place to start. Look for Buffalo to try to replicate their massive success running the ball last week vs. Dallas, and for the Los Angeles defense to begin sagging heavily in the second half.

{"title":"Republicans just dumped Jim Jordan again. They're looking for another speaker candidate","context":"## Republicans just dumped Jim Jordan again. They're looking for another speaker candidate\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Jordan failed again Wednesday on a crucial second ballot to become House speaker, the hard-fighting ally of Donald Trump losing even more GOP colleagues who are refusing to give him the gavel.\nNext steps were highly uncertain as angry, frustrated Republicans looked at other options. A bipartisan group of lawmakers floated an extraordinary plan \u2014 to give the interim speaker-pro-tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., more power to reopen the immobilized House and temporarily conduct routine business.\nWhat was clear was that Jordan\u2019s path to become House speaker was almost certainly lost. He was opposed by 22 Republicans, two more than he lost in first round voting the day before.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep talking to members, keep working on it,\u201d Jordan, a founding member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, said after the vote, vowing to stay in the race.\nThe House came to another abrupt standstill, stuck now 15 days without a speaker \u2014 a position of power second in line to the presidency \u2014 since the sudden ouster of Kevin McCarthy. Once a formality in Congress, the vote for House speaker has devolved into another bitter GOP showdown for the gavel.\nAs Republicans upset and exhausted by the infighting retreated for private conversations, hundreds of protesters, if not more, amassed outside the Capitol over the Israel-Hamas war, a stark reminder of the dangers of having the House adrift as political challenges intensify at home and abroad.\nAhead of the morning vote, Jordan, the combative Judiciary Committee chairman, made an unusual plea for party unity \u2014 almost daring his colleagues to put forward the alternative proposal for a temporary speaker.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been at this two weeks,\u201d Jordan said at the Capitol. \u201cAmerican people deserve to have their government functioning.\u201d\nBut as the roll call got under way, he lost more than he gained, picking up three backers but adding more detractors. No further votes were scheduled.\nThe holdouts added to a surprisingly large and politically diverse group of 20 Republicans who had rejected Jordan\u2019s nomination the day before, many resenting the hardball tactics seeking to enforce support, and viewing the Ohio congressman as too extreme for a central seat of U.S. power.\nWith Republicans in majority control of the House, 221-212, Jordan must pick up most of his GOP foes to win. Wednesday\u2019s tally, with 199 Republicans voting for Jordan and 212 for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, left no candidate with a clear majority, as the 22 Republicans voted for someone else.\nOne new Jordan opponent, Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida, explained his vote, \u201cI think it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d\nBipartisan groups of lawmakers have been floating ways to operate the House by giving greater power to McHenry or another temporary speaker. The House had never ousted its speaker before McCarthy, and McHenry could tap the temporary powers that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks to ensure continuity of government.\nThe novel concept of boosting the interim speaker\u2019s role was gaining favor with a pair of high-profile Republicans: Former GOP speakers Newt Gingrich and John Boehner.\nGingrich said while he likes Jordan, he has \u201cno faith\u201d the nominee can get much beyond the 200 votes he won in the first vote.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sit around and suck our thumbs and hope the world will wait until the House Republicans get their act together,\u201d Gingrich told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on his show.\nBoehner reposted Gingrich\u2019s views saying, \u201cI agree,\u201d on social media.\nThe two men have deep experience with the subject. Both were chased to early retirement.\n\u201cThe Republicans are unable to function right now,\u201d Jeffries said late Tuesday. \u201cAll options are on the table to end the Republican civil war,\u201d he added Wednesday.\nIn nominating Jordan, veteran Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said it was time to end the upheaval that he had warned against with McCarthy\u2019s sudden ouster.\n\u201cWe have a chance today to end that chaos, end that uncertainty,\u201d Cole said.\nHe said that Jordan was not a \u201cshrinking violet\u201d but someone who could lead the House.\nDemocratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California nominated Jeffries, noting the Democratic leader continues to win more votes and is the best choice to move the country forward.\n\u201cThe country cannot afford more delays and more chaos,\u201d Aguilar said.\nJordan had relied on backing from Trump, the party\u2019s frontrunner in the 2024 election to challenge President Joe Biden, and groups pressuring rank-and-file lawmakers for the vote, but it was not enough.\nFlexing their independence, the holdouts are a mix of pragmatists \u2014 ranging from seasoned legislators and committee chairs worried about governing, to newer lawmakers from districts where voters back home prefer President Joe Biden to Trump.\nSome Republicans resent being pressured by Jordan\u2019s allies and say they are being threatened with primary opponents if they don\u2019t support him as speaker. Others are simply upset at the way the whole process has dragged out.\nThey cast their ballots for McCarthy, Majority Leader Steve Scalise \u2014 who had been the party\u2019s first nominee to replace McCarthy \u2014 and others, one vote even going to the retired Boehner.\n\u201cJim Jordan will be a great speaker,\u201d Trump had said Tuesday said outside a courthouse in Manhattan, where he is facing business fraud charges. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to have the votes soon, if not today, over the next day or two.\u201d\nJordan has been a top Trump ally, particularly during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack by the former president\u2019s backers who were trying to overturn the 2020 election he lost to Biden. Days later, Trump awarded Jordan a Medal of Freedom.\nThe political climb has been steep for Jordan who is known more as a chaos agent than a skilled legislator, raising questions about how he would lead. Congress faces daunting challenges, risking a federal shutdown at home if it fails to fund the government and fielding Biden\u2019s requests for aid to help Ukraine and Israel in the wars abroad.\nFirst elected in 2006, Jordan has few bills to his name from his time in office. He also faces questions about his past. Some years ago, Jordan denied allegations from former wrestlers during his time as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University who accused him of knowing about claims they were inappropriately groped by an Ohio doctor. Jordan has said he was never aware of any abuse.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nThis article, authored by Lisa Mascaro, Farnoush Amiri, Stephen Groves, The Associated Press, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-18 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":377}
{"title":"USC vs. Notre Dame live score, updates, highlights from Week 7 college football game","context":"## USC vs. Notre Dame live score, updates, highlights from Week 7 college football game\n\nIn a game with names like Caleb Williams, Sam Hartman, Zachariah Branch and Audric Estime, it felt like there might be no more room for anyone else to play the role of hero.\nEnter Xavier Watts. The Notre Dame safety was a wrecking ball against Williams and the USC offense, picking off Williams twice, forcing a fumble and taking another fumble in for a score. Williams finished the contest with arguably the worst game of his career as No. 21 Notre Dame rode the crucial turnovers and a relentless pass-rush to an overwhelming 48-20 win at home against No. 10 USC.\n\"I think the entire team was hungry,\" Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman said after the game. \"We had a sour taste in our mouth. But the reality is that I've told those guys just compete against [Williams]. He's gonna make plays, he's a great football player, but be relentless in terms of your effort, your attitude, how you attack that guy and to come up big with five turnovers is really impressive.\"\nMORE: Watch college football live with Fubo (free trial)\nRight from the start, it was cleat Notre Dame was going to make things hard on the reigning Heisman Trophy winner. Just four plays into the game, Williams over-threw Lake McRee and Watts picked it off, returning it 38 yards to USC's 12 and setting Notre Dame up for a quick three-play scoring drive.\nMidway through the third quarter, with Notre Dame leading 10-3, Williams again threw a pick to Watts, this time Watts nearly returned it to the end zone before he was stopped at the USC 2. Audric Estime finished the job, scoring the first of two touchdowns to give USC the 17-3 lead. Williams threw another interception on the following drive, the first time he had ever thrown three picks in a single game in his career, and Notre Dame again cashed in the turnover for seven more points.\nLate in the fourth quarter, with USC desperately trying to stay in the game, Watts recovered a fumble after a reception by Mario Williams and raced it into the end zone. Following that turnover, with his team trailing 48-20, Lincoln Riley pulled the starters. The backup running back fumbled the ball on USC's final drive, forced by \u2014 guess who \u2014 Watts, and Notre Dame ran down the clock from there.\n\"Just thank you to all my teammates,\" Watts said after the game. \"None of that would have happened without them. All the pressure they brought, the good coverage down the field.\"\nIn a season in which so much has been made of USC's defensive woes holding back the offense, it was the other way around on Saturday. USC's defense held Notre Dame to just 251 total yards of offense, 51 fewer than the offensive yards by the Trojans. Notre Dame was only three-for-10 on third down compared to six-of-13 by USC. But a 5-0 turnover margin will be difficult for any team to overcome, and it frequently helped Notre Dame have only a short field to work with. The Fighting Irish, on average, started drives at their own 47, while the Trojans began drives on average at their own 28.\nWatts made the headline-grabbing plays, but a massive part of the Fighting Irish's defensive success came in the trenches. The defensive line by Notre Dame tallied six sacks of Williams and three more hits as it frequently pressed the Trojan quarterback. Williams finished the game just 23-for-37 with 199 passing yards with one passing touchdown and three picks.\nThe Sporting News tracked updates and highlights from Saturday's Week 7 game between USC and Notre Dame.\nUSC vs. Notre Dame score\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Final USC 3 3 7 7 20 Notre Dame 7 17 7 17 48\nUSC vs. Notre Dame results, highlights from Week 7 game\n(All times Eastern)\nFourth quarter\n10:51 p.m.: And that will do it.

{"title":"Breaking down each VAR intervention from wild first half of Tottenham vs Chelsea officiated by Michael Oliver","context":"## Breaking down each VAR intervention from wild first half of Tottenham vs Chelsea officiated by Michael Oliver\n\nLondon derbies are always full of venom and vigor, but the opening 45 minutes of Tottenham vs. Chelsea on Monday produced one of the greatest train wrecks in the history of the English top flight.\nWith repeated refereeing blunders one of the main talking points of the season thus far, a half full of VAR checks and highly scrutinized decisions caused absolute chaos on the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium pitch.\nAll told, one red card and four yellow cards were produced by Michael Oliver with help from VAR official John Brooks, while Chelsea saw goals ruled out on an incredible four separate occasions. It resulted in an incredible 12 minutes of stoppage time, and while many of the decisions were widely analysed as correct, the lengthy review processes were criticised just as much as the eventual results.\nThe first half would end level at 1-1, with Tottenham reduced to 10 men, and Premier League fans had plenty to talk about with friends, fans, and coworkers. The Sporting News breaks down each memorable moment in what was an action-packed opening 45 minutes.\nMORE: Recap the Premier League match with commentary, highlights, & more from Tottenham vs Chelsea\nFirst half of Chelsea vs Tottenham features multiple VAR reviews\nThe game got off to a flying start as Dejan Kulusevski opened the scoring for Spurs, benefitting from a large deflection off Chelsea defender Levi Colwill which left Roberto Sanchez with no chance to make a save.\nWith both sides flying forward with electric attacking intent, the match got out of hand quickly.\nHeung-Min Son goal disallowed for offside\nThe flood of VAR interventions came on a relatively innocuous decision where Heung-Min Son seemingly put Tottenham 2-0 up in the 14th minute, but on review the play appeared extremely tight. Ultimately, Son did look as if he was just an inch offside, and the goal was ruled out.\n\ud83d\udcf8 - The official VAR image, offside!

Udogie's tackle was extremely dangerous, as he lunged in with a leg-breaker.\nUltimately, the Tottenham defender would escape without further punishment for one reason: he missed. Just like Kai Havertz of Arsenal earlier this weekend, who also remained on the pitch against Newcastle for a similar incident, Udogie's tackle would not reach the necessary threshold for a straight red as he did not make full contact with Sterling.\nNBC commentator Jon Champion, who has real-time access to the VAR communication, said that the review ultimately determined the tackle was an \"upper-level yellow card\" that didn't quite meet the qualifications for a red.\nCristian Romero next to avoid straight red card despite review\nJust four minutes later, another Tottenham defender would again get away with just a booking despite a VAR review for a possible red card.\nCristian Romero, often criticised for his reckless nature, had a kick-out at Levi Colwill in the 22nd minute behind the play while laying on the ground. He kicked Colwill right in the calf, but no action was taken.\nThis passage of play was not reviewed by VAR. It's unclear exactly why, but an assumption can be made that the VAR official was likely not aware of the incident until play had already restarted, at which point he cannot intervene. Those incidents have to be caught before play restarts, which is extremely difficult to do as the game continues to flow.\n\ud83d\udea8| Romero intentionally kicks Colwill but VAR have not checked it. pic.twitter.com\/VCfMjmYEWR \u2014 CentreGoals. (@centregoals) November 6, 2023\nRaheem Sterling goal disallowed\nChelsea were the next to see a goal chalked off, as Raheem Sterling's 21st minute equaliser was nullified on review. The decision came as Sterling's initial effort, blocked by Pedro Porro, deflected straight back onto the arm of the Chelsea forward.\nBy rule, any contact by the ball with the arm or hand of an attacking player is an automatic foul, regardless of arm position, intent, or any other factor. Thus, the goal was disallowed.\nCorrect decision to rule out Sterling's goal? pic.twitter.com\/VKnrNC0Y0K \u2014 Football Tweet \u26bd\uea00 (@Football__Tweet) November 6, 2023\nCristian Romero sent off on VAR review, Chelsea awarded penalty\nIn what was easily the defining moment of the match, Chelsea were ultimately awarded a penalty after a wild passage of play in the 31st minute where they initially put the ball in the back of the net. The goal was ruled out, but a penalty was eventually given along with the first red card.\nThe ball pinged around the Tottenham penalty area wildly with Spurs unable to clear after blocking multiple efforts, until Moises Caicedo finally buried a long-distance effort with a low finish inside the left post. Despite initially appearing to count, the offside flag was raised extremely late, with the assistant referee determining, after a moment to think, that Nicolas Jackson was interfering with play from an offside position.\nYet that was just the beginning of the saga. With the goal disallowed, a VAR review began for a penalty as Cristian Romero swung wildly into the shins of Raheem Sterling. While he got the ball with his tackle, he followed through with extreme force straight onto both of Sterling's legs, and referee Michael Oliver was sent to the monitor.\nAfter a few looks, Oliver produced a straight red card for Romero's tackle and awarded Chelsea a penalty, which Cole Palmer dispatched to even the scoreline at 1-1.\nWatch in USA:\nAfter Chelsea had a goal from Moises Caicedo disallowed due to offside, Cristian Romero was given a red card following a challenge on Enzo Fernandez.\n\nChelsea were given a penalty and Tottenham went down to 10 men. #TOTCHE pic.twitter.com\/sOzTrxgBzm \u2014 NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) November 6, 2023\nWatch in UK:\n\"AMID FRENZY AND FURY!\" \ud83e\udd2f\n\nCole Palmer levels for Chelsea as Cristian Romero sees red! \ud83d\udfe5 pic.twitter.com\/1oULwk1uOP \u2014 Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) November 6, 2023\nNicolas Jackson goal disallowed for offside\nChelsea would see a third goal of the half disallowed as Nicolas Jackson put the ball in the net on 37 minutes but Raheem Sterling was offside in the buildup just past the midfield stripe. There's very little argument to be had here, and the game played on.\nWhile it was a decision that featured little, if any, controversy, it added to the mayhem of the half and contributed to the game's overall narrative.\nChelsea have a THIRD goal disallowed as Sterling is offside \ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com\/brMes6qQQ7 \u2014 Mail Sport (@MailSport) November 6, 2023\nReece James avoids red card despite elbow to Destiny Udogie\nWhile two Tottenham defenders escaped an early shower earlier in the match for incidents that could have potentially seen them off, Chelsea also had a player avoid further punishment just before halftime.\nReece James caught Destiny Udogie in the face with a trailing elbow while challenging for a bouncing ball in the air. Referees have been strict with incidents such as these, and it was surprising to see James get away with just a yellow card.\nThe incident was indeed reviewed, but the VAR official did not ultimately advise a check for Michael Oliver.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Bonn, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-06 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":379}
{"title":"Sony Music has issued nearly 10,000 deepfake takedowns\u2026 and other things we learned from Dennis Kooker\u2019s speech about AI","context":"## Sony Music has issued nearly 10,000 deepfake takedowns\u2026 and other things we learned from Dennis Kooker\u2019s speech about AI\n\nSenior political figures in Washington are becoming increasingly interested in the impact of AI on the law.\nOn Wednesday (November 29), US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer held an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Insight Forum to discuss the importance and role of creative copyright and intellectual property in the development of AI.\nDennis Kooker, Sony Music Entertainment\u2018s President of Global Digital Business & US Sales, delivered a speech at the Forum, outlining the major music company\u2019s position on AI and copyright law.\nKooker\u2019s public statements on the topic arrive a week after MBW pointed out that there was a notable lack of endorsement from SME, and its artists, of YouTube\u2018s new experimental AI project called \u2018Dream Track\u2019 that lets creators clone the vocals of successful musicians.\nThe initial cohort of stars involved in the project, as we noted last week, include recording artists signed to Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group \u2013 or labels within each of those two majors, but no Sony Music artists.\n(In our report, MBW suggested that YouTube parent Google\u2018s recent submission to The United States Copyright Office (USCO) \u2013 in response to a request for written submissions as part of a study around copyright law and policy issues raised by AI systems \u2013 may have influenced Sony\u2019s absence from Dream Track.)\nGoogle was just one of various tech giants and AI companies that submitted responses to the USCO, amongst them, Anthropic and Stability AI.\nAnthropic, in its submission to the USCO, also argued that training (large language models) LLM\u2019s on copyrighted material is fair use.\nStability AI made a similar argument. Its position on the issue of \u201cFair Use\u201d concerning AI and copyrighted content resulted in the resignation of prominent generative AI executive Ed Newton-Rex from the company.\nAs reported by MBW last week, Universal Music Group submitted its response to the USCO. Unsurprisingly, amongst the highlights of UMG\u2019s submission was the rejection of the notion that using copyrighted material to train LLMs is \u201cfair use\u201d.\nIn his speech on Wednesday, Kooker commented directly on the flurry of submissions to the USCO from the tech industry at the end of October.\nIn what may have been a nod to Google\u2019s filing and \u201cfair use\u201d position, Kooker told Senators that \u201cbased on recent Copyright Office filings it is clear that the technology industry and speculative financial investors would like governments to believe in a very distorted view of copyright\u201d.\nHe added: \u201c[That view is] one in which music is considered fair use for training purposes and in which certain companies are permitted to appropriate the entire value produced by the creative sector without permission, and to build huge businesses based on it without paying anything to the creators concerned.\u201d\nKooker also openly discussed Sony Music\u2019s efforts to get unauthorized AI content removed from platforms online \u2013 including the fact that the firm has already issued close to 10,000 separate takedowns.\nKooker further discussed Sony Music\u2019s optimism about AI\u2019s potential for enhancing creativity, as well as key principles the company has adopted around generative AI.\nHere are three things that stood out from Kooker\u2019s speech\u2026\n1. Sony Music has issued close to 10,000 takedowns for unauthorized deep fakes of artists\nKooker argued in his speech that, while \u201cthe music industry sees great potential with various forms of AI technology in this early phase of AI,\u201d so far, \u201cthe available generative AI products are not delivering on the expected promise of new products in creative industries\u201d.\nHe clarified that point by explaining that some generative AI platforms \u201care not expanding the business model or enhancing human creativity\u201d.\nKooker suggested that the \u201cmore dire outputs of early generative AI technology are deep fakes and unauthorized voice clones\u201d of artists and that in the United States, \u201cartists are not adequately protected from these deepfakes\u201d.\n\u201cAn artist literally makes their livelihood from their voice,\u201d he said. \u201cDeep fakes intentionally exploit an artist\u2019s talent and reputation to steal that income stream.\n\u201cEvery stream of a deep fake takes streams and royalty payments away from the legitimate artist. Deepfakes are also misleading and confusing to consumers and music fans who are not typically interested in supporting fake versions of their favorite artist.\u201d\n\u201cEvery stream of a deep fake takes streams and royalty payments away from the legitimate artist.\u201d Dennis Kooker, Sony Music\nKooker reported that to date, Sony Music Entertainment has sent \u201cclose to 10,000 takedowns to a variety of platforms hosting unauthorized deepfakes that SME artists asked us to take down.\u201d\nHe added that \u201cplatforms are quick to point to the loopholes in the law as an excuse to drag their feet or to not take the deepfakes down when requested.\u201d\nKooker commended the No FAKES Act policy drafted by senators earlier this year, which he explained \u201cwould create a federal property right in one\u2019s voice or visual likeness and protect against unauthorized AI-generated replicas\u201d.\n2. Sony has \u2018roughly 200 active conversations taking place\u2019 with AI startups that \u201cinclude potential equity investments\u201d\nKooker explained that despite the negative impacts of AI, including unauthorized clones and low-quality AI music, there are still \u201cmany positive and optimistic developments to highlight\u201d.\nHe highlighted legitimate AI startups and established firms \u201cwith music ideas that want to partner with the industry\u201d.\nAccording to Kooker, Sony Music has \u201croughly 200 active conversations taking place with startups and established players\u201d right now about building new AI-related products and tools.\nThese products range from tools for \u201ccreative or marketing assistance\u201d, to tools that \u201cpotentially give us the ability to better protect artist content or find it when used in an unauthorized fashion\u201d as well as \u201cbrand new products that have never been launched before\u201d.\nKooker said that some of these conversations \u201calso include potential equity investments which would accelerate the development of these companies\u201d.\nThe Sony Music exec cited, as an example, a recent generative AI-powered project around a reissue and remix of an album. Although Kooker didn\u2019t name it specifically, SME did recently announce a generative AI project with The Orb and David Gilmour, which was a partnership between Sony Music Entertainment, Legacy Recordings AI company Vermillio\n\u201cThese artists are known for their cutting-edge experimentation in music,\u201d said Kooker.\n\u201cAbout the time that we started the discussion with this artist, we had begun informal talks with a generative AI start-up company whose business model focused on working with IP rightsholders the \u2018right way\u2019.\n\u201cIn other words, they respect intellectual property rights and want to work with rights holders in ways that enhance and protect the copyrighted works.\u201d\n3. SME has asked Congress to embrace a set of principles around generative AI\nKooker told the lawmakers during his speech on Wednesday that \u201cif copyrights are protected and enforced appropriately, we are at the beginning of a multi-decade marathon that will change the creative and commercial landscape for music\u201d.\nWith that in mind, Kooker explained that Sony Music has established a set of principles to guide the company\u2019s decision-making around generative AI.\n\u201cIf copyrights are protected and enforced appropriately, we are at the beginning of a multi-decade marathon that will change the creative and commercial landscape for music.\u201d Dennis Kooker, Sony Music\nKooker added later in the speech: \u201cMusic is a tremendous driver for AI technology, and AI technology presents a tremendous opportunity for the creative development of music.\n\u201cBut these opportunities must be grounded by the human creators\u2019 vision with the machine assisting, not with the machine replacing the human creator.\u201d\nTo achieve this, Kooker said that SME wants Congress to embrace the following principals:\nAssure Consent, Compensation, and Credit. \u201cNew products and businesses built with music must be developed with the consent of the owner and appropriate compensation and credit. It is essential to understand why the training of AI models is being done, what products will be developed as a result, and what the business model is that will monetize the use of the artist\u2019s work. Congress and the agencies should assure that creators\u2019 rights are recognized and respected.\u201d Confirm That Copying Music to Train AI Models is Not Fair Use. \u201cEven worse are those that argue that copyrighted content should automatically be considered fair use so that protected works are never compensated for usage and creators have no say in the products or business models that are developed around them and their work. Congress should assure and agencies should presume that reproducing music to train AI models, in itself, is not a fair use.\u201d Prevent the Cloning of Artists\u2019 Voices and Likenesses Without Express Permission. \u201cWe cannot allow an artist\u2019s voice or likeness to be cloned for use without the express permission of the artist. This is a very personal decision for the artist. Congress should pass into law effective federal protections for name, image, and likeness.\u201d Incentivize Accurate Recordkeeping. \u201cCorrect attribution will be a critical element to artists being paid fairly and correctly for new works that are created. In addition, rights can only be enforced around the training of AI when there are accurate records about what is being copied. Otherwise, the inability to enforce rights in the AI marketplace equates to a lack of rights at all, producing a dangerous imbalance that prevents a thriving ecosystem. This requires strong and accurate record keeping by the generative AI platforms, a requirement that urgently needs legislative support to ensure incentives are in place so that it happens consistently and correctly.\u201d Assure Transparency for Consumers and Artists. \u201cTransparency is necessary to clearly distinguish human-created works from AI-created works. The public should know, when they are listening to music, whether that music was created by a human being or a machine.\u201d\nAdded Kooker: \u201cWhile these principles are simple and basic, they require a new level of commitment and investment from generative AI platforms.\n\u201cIf established early on, they will result in an even playing field for all participants so there will not be an unfair competitive advantage for a few at the expense of future innovators.\n\u201cThe principles will ensure that intellectual property businesses can succeed in this new world alongside tech partners, further advancing investment and expanding economic opportunities. \u201cMusic Business Worldwide\n\nThis article, authored by Murray Stassen, was published by Music Business Worldwide on 2023-11-30 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":380}

MBW Explains is supported by JKBX , a technology platform that offers consumers access to music royalties as an asset class.\nAs we said last week: Welcome to the future.\nSeven days ago (November 16), YouTube unveiled a revolutionary new experiment \u2013 \u2018Dream Track\u2019 \u2013 enabling creators to clone the vocals, via AI tech and with official consent, of well-known stars.\nCharlie Puth\u2019s voice is on there. John Legend\u2019s voice is on there. Demi Lovato\u2019s voice is on there.\nIn fact, the voices of a number of well-known recording artists signed to Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group \u2013 or labels within each major \u2013 are on there.\nYet something conspicuous is not on there: any endorsement whatsoever from the world\u2019s second-biggest recording company, Sony Music Entertainment, or its artists.\nWhy is Sony missing?\nMBW understands that Sony Music (the recorded music arm of Sony Music Group) has, like Universal and Warner, been in discussions for months with YouTube over potentially licensing the \u2018Dream Track\u2019 experiment.\nDuring this period of discussion, YouTube has made a number of positive announcements regarding the biggest issue for any rightsholder regarding AI-driven voice replication of artists: their ability to police it.\nIn August, YouTube and Universal Music Group jointly announced that the video platform was launching an \u2018AI Music Incubator\u2019 \u2013 a program by which new tools and innovations will be developed at YouTube in close conjunction with artists and the music biz.

To progress this \u2018incubator\u2019, YouTube said it was working behind the scenes with a number of UMG-affiliated artists; Also in August, YouTube publicly committed to three principles\/pledges behind its development of music-based generative AI tools .

They promised \u201cinvest[ment] in the AI-powered technology\u201d that, amongst other things, would help YouTube \u201cprotect our community of viewers, creators, artists and songwriters\u2026 [from] trademark and copyright abuse\u201d .

These pledges promised in said tools. They promised that, amongst other things, would help YouTube . This all seemed to hint at a desire to build a on YouTube to control and police content made by cloning artists\u2019 voices; Then, earlier this month, YouTube announced it was developing a specific system for music partners that allowed them to request the removal of content on its platform that \u201cmimics an artist\u2019s unique singing or rapping voice\u201d.\nEvidently, all of this was enough for Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group to dip their toe into the \u2018Dream Track\u2019 experiment \u2013 though not without caution.\nSir Lucian Grainge, Chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, said of UMG\u2019s decision to offer a limited license to \u2018Dream Track\u2019: \u201cWe have a fundamental responsibility to our artists to ensure the digital ecosystem evolves to protect them and their work against unauthorized exploitation, including by generative AI platforms.\n\u201cAt the same time, we must help artists achieve their greatest creative and commercial potential \u2013 in part by providing them access to the kind of opportunities and cutting-edge creative tools made possible by AI.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a fundamental responsibility to our artists to ensure the digital ecosystem evolves to protect them and their work against unauthorized exploitation, including by generative AI platforms. At the same time, we must help artists achieve their greatest creative and commercial potential\u2026\u201d Sir Lucian Grainge on UMG\u2019s decision to license YouTube\u2019s \u2018Dream Track\u2019 experiment\nRobert Kyncl, CEO of Warner Music Group \u2013 and an ex-high flyer at YouTube \u2013 commented: \u201cWith each major leap in technology, the music industry navigates a fresh set of challenges and opportunities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always the case that, from the outset, tech platforms partner with artists, songwriters, labels, and publishers to experiment, iterate, and find possible solutions.\n\u201cYouTube is taking a collaborative approach with this Beta. These artists are being offered the choice to lean in, and we\u2019re pleased to experiment and find out what the creators come up with.\u201d\nWhy, then, did Sony Music not join its rivals in granting YouTube and \u2018Dream Track\u2019 access to any of its active artists\u2019 licensed voices?\nEspecially when SME has shown its own willingness to experiment with generative AI music platforms this week via this announcement about a project with David Gilmour, The Orb, and AI company Vermillio?\nSources close to Sony Music\u2019s HQ in New York have suggested to MBW that the company is taking an \u201cartist-led\u201d approach to its experiments with any AI platform that can manipulate the work (or voice) of its roster.\nIn the case of YouTube\u2019s \u2018Dream Track\u2018, MBW understands, SME first offered the opportunity to participate to a number of its artists, but this group of acts did not show enthusiasm about participating.\n(If one of these artists was Bad Bunny, signed to Sony\u2019s The Orchard, you can see why: The Puerto Rican superstar expressed fury the other week about a popular track on TikTok that had cloned his vocal stylings via AI.)\nBut last month something else happened that, we hear, effectively scuppered any chance that Sony Music would get involved with \u2018Dream Track\u2019 at this juncture.\nOn October 30, Google \u2013 the parent of YouTube within Alphabet Inc. \u2013 issued a filing with the US Copyright Office that outlined its core position on \u2018Artificial Intelligence and Copyright\u2019.\nThe contents of this document have caused some alarm at Sony Music HQ.\nWhat was in the Google document?\nYou may have read on MBW last week that Ed Newton-Rex \u2013 a generative AI pioneer, but also a published composer \u2013 decided to quit his role at Stability AI over concerns over the company\u2019s position on \u201cfair use\u201d within its own recent US Copyright Office filing.\n\u2018Fair use\u2019 is, as it sounds, the argument that there are cases where copyrighted material can be used and even replicated that are, well, fair enough.\nA clumsy example: I read a great book, then I meet you for breakfast, where I tell you about the story and quote a couple of my favorite passages to you.\nTo suggest I\u2019ve just committed copyright infringement wouldn\u2019t only be silly \u2013 it would mean that copyright protections were getting in the way of the commercial furtherment of the author\/rightsholder (i.e. you might go and buy the book on my recommendation).\nGoogle\u2019s submission to the USCO contains a number of passages that posit a similar position\u2026 but for generative AI models. The document argues that the ingestion of copyrighted material for the training of generative AI platforms shouldn\u2019t be hampered by copyright law.\nYou can read the full Google USCO submission here, but below are a few of the choicest sections on this topic:\n\u201cThe doctrine of fair use [within existing US copyright law] provides that copying for a new and different purpose is permitted without authorization where \u2014 as with training Al systems \u2014 the secondary use is transformative and does not substitute for the copyrighted work .\u201d\n[within existing US copyright law] provides that copying for a new and different purpose is permitted without authorization where \u2014 as with \u2014 the secondary use is transformative and .\u201d \u201cIf [AI] training could be accomplished without the creation of copies, there would be no copyright questions here. Indeed that act of \u201cknowledge harvesting\u201d\u2026 like the act of reading a book and learning the facts and ideas within it , would not only be non-infringing , it would further the very purpose of copyright law. The mere fact that, as a technological matter, copies need to be made to extract those ideas and facts from copyrighted works should not alter that result .\u201d\ncould be accomplished without the creation of copies, there would be no copyright questions here. Indeed that act of \u201cknowledge harvesting\u201d\u2026 like the , would not only be , it would further the very purpose of copyright law. The mere fact that, as a technological matter, .\u201d \u201cSome might object to this logic in the context of generative Al systems, arguing that even if such a system produces content that is not substantially similar to any of the content it was trained on, the output of that model might compete in the marketplace with works used for training or, more broadly, with the authors of those works \u2026 This argument misunderstands both the nature of the fair use inquiry and the creative markets that copyright is intended to protect. Even if generative-Al-assisted outputs do compete with existing works that were used in training, or with future works by the authors of those works, the pro-competitive nature of copying for the purpose of \u201cknowledge harvesting\u201d has traditionally been a reason to favor a holding of fair use , not a reason to reject it.\u201d\nthe output of that model might \u2026 Even if generative-Al-assisted outputs do compete with existing works that were used in training, or with future works by the authors of those works, the pro-competitive nature of copying for the purpose of \u201cknowledge harvesting\u201d has traditionally been a reason to , not a reason to reject it.\u201d And then the kicker: \u201cAny prohibition or limitation on the use of copyrighted materials for purposes of Al training would therefore undermine the purpose of copyright and foreclose the many opportunities that come with this technology.\u201d\nTo be fair to Google, its submission does make note of the importance of US copyright law, including when applied to generative AI, striking \u201cthe right balance between the legitimate interests of rightsholders and the equally legitimate interests of the public and succeeding generations of creators\u201d.\nYet it could clearly be argued that Google\u2019s take on copyright \u201charvesting\u201d by generative AI models sits in odd contrast to the copyright-related reassurances that YouTube has been careful to make to the music industry during the pre-development, development, and trial launch of \u2018Dream Track\u2019.\nA final thought\u2026\nMBW\u2019s sources close to Sony Music were keen to point out that the company\u2019s general ongoing relationship with YouTube and YouTube Music is a harmonious one.\n(YouTube is, after all, now the second largest commercial partner of the major record companies \u2013 with a stated ambition to catch up with Spotify in the years ahead. YouTube says it paid out over USD $6 billion to music rightsholders in the year to end of June 2022, with around $2 billion of that coming just from ads on user-generated content.)\nHowever, the October US Copyright Office filing from Google has definitely put the cat amongst the pigeons at Sony Music HQ. As we\u2019re sure it has at the other two major record companies.\n\u201cAny prohibition or limitation on the use of copyrighted materials for purposes of Al training would undermine the purpose of copyright and foreclose the many opportunities that come with this technology.\u201d Google filing with the US Copyright Office, October 30\nWitness Universal Music Group\u2019s own filing with the US Copyright Office on the topic of AI. It couldn\u2019t offer a starker contrast to Google\u2019s assertion that \u201cprohibition or limitation on the use of copyrighted materials for purposes of Al training would undermine the purpose of copyright and foreclose the many opportunities that come with this technology\u201d.\n(Example from UMG\u2019s filing: \u201cThe wholesale appropriation of UMG\u2019s enormous catalog of copyright-protected sound recordings and musical compositions to build multibillion commercial enterprises [in AI] is anything but fair use.\u201d)\nAs well as part-explaining Sony Music\u2019s refusal to be included in \u2018Dream Track\u2019 thus far, Google\u2019s USCO filing also perhaps explains the careful words selected by Robert Kyncl and especially Sir Lucian Grainge in their respective comments endorsing YouTube\u2019s AI experiment.\n(Grainge\u2019s statement, remember, began: \u201cWe have a fundamental responsibility to our artists to ensure the digital ecosystem evolves to protect them and their work against unauthorized exploitation, including by generative AI platforms\u2026\u201d)\nOne interesting final observation on the clutch of artists who agreed, with their record companies, to enter the YouTube \u2018Dream Track\u2019 trial?\nThey\u2019re stars, for sure. But in both the case of Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group, they\u2019re \u2013 currently anyway \u2013 not the biggest megastars on either company\u2019s books.\nYou might not expect, at this early stage, for the likes of UMG to put forward Drake, Taylor Swift, or The Beatles \u2013 or for WMG to put forward Ed Sheeran or Dua Lipa \u2013 to be guinea pigs in any early AI music experiments, even if they\u2019re run by \u2018friends\u2019 of the music industry like YouTube.\nYou might, then, also understandably wonder if there have been significant licensing payments made by YouTube to UMG and WMG for the right to play with the AI vocals of artists who have signed off on \u2018Dream Track\u2019 thus far. And, if so, if these payments are being placed against any as-yet-unrecouped advances that some of these artists may have on their label accounts.\nMore broadly, you might ponder a bigger question.\nWhen the day comes that YouTube asks the world\u2019s biggest superstars to wholeheartedly embrace \u2018Dream Track\u2019, will Google\u2019s recent US Copyright Office filing give said superstars \u2013 and their record companies \u2013 pause for thought?\nJKBX (pronounced \"Jukebox\") unlocks shared value from things people love by offering consumers access to music as an asset class \u2014 it calls them Royalty Shares.

{"title":"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse on Netflix, A Haunting in Venice, and every new movie to watch this weekend","context":"## Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse on Netflix, A Haunting in Venice, and every new movie to watch this weekend\n\nHappy Friday, Polygon readers! Each week, we round up the most notable releases to streaming and video rental, highlighting the biggest and best new movies for you to watch at home.\nThis week\u2019s biggest debut is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which is now streaming on Netflix. That\u2019s not all, as Insidious: The Red Door \u2014 the fifth installment in the Insidious horror franchise \u2014 also arrives on the platform this week alongside Jawan, one of the biggest Indian action movies of the year. There\u2019s plenty more exciting releases this week too, with A Haunting in Venice now streaming on Hulu, the Italian superhero movie Freaks vs. the Reich on Prime Video, plus the premiere of The Kill Room and Outlaw Johnny Black from director-star Michael Jai White on VOD.\nHere\u2019s everything new to watch this weekend!\nNew on Netflix\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on Netflix\nGenre: Superhero action\nRun time: 2h 20m\nDirector: Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, Justin K. Thompson\nCast: Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac\nThe highly anticipated follow-up to 2018\u2019s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse sees Miles Morales facing off not only against a dimension-hopping nemesis in the form of the Spot, but a whole multiverse of Spider-Mans, Spider-People, and even a Spider-Dinosaur as he attempts to save the day once again.\nFrom our multiversal review:\nNot every theme and plot and moment in Across the Spider-Verse lands, particularly with the other part of this story still most of a year away. But in the end, the theme of the Spider-Verse movies is shaping up to be a story about people trying to be bigger and bolder themselves, trying to reach beyond what they\u2019re told they\u2019re capable of, and do more. It\u2019s no wonder that every part of Across the Spider-Verse is an attempt to outdo the first movie. The idea of growing, of surpassing and ignoring everyone else\u2019s limits, is the heart of this series\u2019 heroes and their individual journeys. It looks like the movies themselves are designed to follow suit.\nJawan\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on Netflix\nGenre: Action thriller\nRun time: 2h 50m\nDirector: Atlee\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi\nThe biggest Indian movie of the year has landed on Netflix. Directed by Atlee (Mersal), Jawan features megastar Shah Rukh Khan (between this and Pathaan, he is truly back) and is basically \u201cRobin Hood meets Charlie\u2019s Angels.\u201d\nInsidious: The Red Door\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on Netflix Saturday\nGenre: Supernatural horror\nRun time: 1h 47m\nDirector: Patrick Wilson\nCast: Ty Simpkins, Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne\nThe fifth movie in the Insidious franchise is the directorial debut for star Patrick Wilson. It\u2019s also a sequel to Insidious: Chapter 2, as the last two movies in the franchise were prequels.\nFrom our review:\nAs a director, Wilson isn\u2019t as effortless a horror ringmaster as Wan or Whannell: He favors more actor-centric scares than wild imagery. But he makes great use of expressive close-ups (often of himself) and shallow focus, with a few creepy It Follows-like shots of blurry figures approaching from the distance, and a terrifically claustrophobic scene inside an MRI machine. Dalton\u2019s college story, meanwhile, occasionally borders on campus-prank zaniness: It includes what can only be described as a puke ghost, and there\u2019s one amusing use of the horror movie cliche about the haunted little kid who makes terrifying drawings of the ghouls only he can see. (Naturally, that kid grows up to become a star pupil in an insufferable freshman art class.)\nSly\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on Netflix\nGenre: Documentary\nRun time: 1h 35m\nDirector: Thom Zimny\nCast: Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Quentin Tarantino\nThis documentary takes a close look at the life of one of the great American movie stars and film writers: Sylvester Stallone.\nNyad\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on Netflix\nGenre: Biographical sports drama\nRun time: 2h 1m\nDirectors: Jimmy Chin, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi\nCast: Jodie Foster, Annette Bening, Rhys Ifans\nNyad tells the (questionably) true story of swimmer Diana Nyad, who swam from Cuba to Florida at 64 years old, among many other swimming accomplishments.\nWingwomen\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on Netflix\nGenre: Action\nRun time: 1h 56m\nDirector: M\u00e9lanie Laurent\nCast: M\u00e9lanie Laurent, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, Isabelle Adjani\nM\u00e9lanie Laurent (Inglourious Basterds) is both behind and in front of the camera in this action comedy about women thieves on the run looking to pull off one last job.\nNew on Hulu\nA Haunting in Venice\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on Hulu\nGenre: Horror mystery\nRun time: 1h 43m\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\nCast: Kenneth Branagh, Michelle Yeoh, Jamie Dornan\nKenneth Branagh\u2019s Poirot adaptations have generally been a fun time, even when they have problems (looking at you, Death on the Nile). A Haunting in Venice is his best yet, as Branagh\u2019s confidence as director and performer in this mode only continues to grow. It\u2019s perfect fall viewing.\nQuiz Lady\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on Hulu\nGenre: Comedy\nRun time: 1h 39m\nDirector: Jessica Yu\nCast: Awkwafina, Sandra Oh, Will Ferrell\nSandra Oh and Awkwafina play a pair of estranged sisters who try to win big on a game show to pay off their mom\u2019s debts. The supporting cast includes Will Ferrell, Jason Schwartzman, Tony Hale, and the late Paul Reubens.\nNew on Prime Video\nFreaks vs. the Reich\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on Prime Video\nGenre: Superhero\/circus war movie\nRun time: 2h 21m\nDirector: Gabriele Mainetti\nCast: Claudio Santamaria, Aurora Giovinazzo, Pietro Castellitto\nThis offbeat Italian superhero movie follows a group of circus performers in World War II who are sought after by the Nazis and team up to stop them. I have heard it\u2019s funny, sweet, and has strong action \u2014 definitely on my weekend watchlist.\nNew on Peacock\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on Peacock\nGenre: Romantic comedy\nRun time: 1h 32m\nDirector: Nia Vardalos\nCast: Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Louis Mandylor\nOne of cinema\u2019s most endearingly goofy families is back, in the most family-centric franchise this side of the Fast and Furious movies. It\u2019s the first Greek Wedding movie since 2016, which came nearly 15 years after the original smash hit. This time, star-writer Nia Vardalos takes over directorial duties, following up her 2009 directorial debut I Hate Valentine\u2019s Day.\nNew on AMC Plus\nSympathy for the Devil\nWhere to watch: Available to stream on AMC Plus\nGenre: Psychological thriller\nRun time: 1h 30m\nDirector: Yuval Adler\nCast: Nicolas Cage, Joel Kinnaman\nA largely two-person movie that sounds a bit like Collateral, Sympathy for the Devil stars Nicolas Cage as a passenger who holds a driver (Joel Kinnaman) hostage on a long car trip.\nNew to rent\nPaw Patrol: The Mighty Movie\nWhere to watch: Available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\nGenre: Action adventure\nRun time: 1h 35m\nDirector: Cal Brunker\nCast: Mckenna Grace, Taraji P. Henson, Marsai Martin\nThe Paw Patrol is back \u2014 this sequel to the first movie sees the pup get superpowers in their quest to stop Mayor Humdinger from destroying Adventure City.\nThe Kill Room\nWhere to watch: Available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\nGenre: Dark comedy thriller\nRun time: 1h 38m\nDirector: Nicol Paone\nCast: Joe Manganiello, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman\nJoe Manganiello stars as a hitman turned artist in this funny comedy about how the worlds of fine art and high crime aren\u2019t so separated after all. When he turns to art as a method of laundering money, the hitman becomes an unexpected overnight sensation in the high-art scene.\nOutlaw Johnny Black\nWhere to watch: Available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\nGenre: Satirical Western\nRun time: 2h 10m\nDirector: Michael Jai White\nCast: Michael Jai White, Anika Noni Rose, Erica Ash\nMichael Jai White\u2019s long-awaited follow-up to Black Dynamite is finally here: a \u201cWest-ploitation\u201d movie about an outlaw who pretends to be a preacher and settles in a new troubled town. The star and director spoke to us at length about the movie and the long road it took to get here.\nSound of Freedom\nWhere to watch: Available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu\nGenre: Crime thriller\nRun time: 2h 11m\nDirector: Alejandro G\u00f3mez Monteverde\nCast: Jim Caviezel, Mira Sorvino, Bill Camp\nOne of the most surprising (and controversial) box-office hits of the year, Sound of Freedom purports to be a true story about stopping child trafficking. The truth is much more complicated than that.\n\nThis article, authored by Pete Volk, was published by Polygon on 2023-11-03 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":382}
{"title":"Spider-Man 2 toys with Marvel history to be as much fun as possible","context":"## Spider-Man 2 toys with Marvel history to be as much fun as possible\n\n\u201cThose slavering jaws; the lolling tongue; the rime of saliva on the grizzled chops.\u201d\nThis is Angela Carter, not on Venom, but on the wolf from \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d in The Bloody Chamber, her collection of reimagined folk and fairy tales. It\u2019s actually from \u201cThe Company of Wolves,\u201d which is one of three retellings of \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d in the collection, each with its own spin on the familiar tale.\nPolygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it\u2019s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun \u2014 and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch .\nRetellings are compelling because they allow writers to toy with readers\u2019 preconceived notions of how the story \u201cshould go,\u201d both in terms of genre conventions and in terms of plot. We know Little Red Riding Hood will go to her grandmother\u2019s house, where she will find that her grandmother has been eaten by a wolf, just as we know Spider-Man will be bitten by a radioactive spider. The fun, both for the author and the reader, comes in deviating from those norms \u2014 in finding new ways to tell old tales.\nWith Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac Games attempts something similar.\nMainstream Spider-Man stories are increasingly Spider-Men stories, and Spider-Man 2, the third Spidey game from Insomniac, is no different. You play as both the yassified Peter Parker from Spider-Man Remastered and Miles Morales from his eponymous debut in 2020, switching between the two at your leisure with all the speed afforded by the PlayStation 5\u2019s SSD.\nIn fact, speed is one of the primary improvements on display in the first PS5-exclusive Spider-Man game. New to the series are web wings, which allow the Spider-Mans to fly through the city, gliding over rooftops and gaining speed from wind tunnels without needing to rely on buildings, bridges, or other anchors for web-slinging. (They\u2019re especially useful when crossing the East River into the newly added Brooklyn and Queens.) Web-swinging is faster now as well, enhancing that ineffable feeling of being Spider-Man as you glide through New York with ease. Whether you\u2019re playing as Miles or Peter, traversing the three available boroughs is an undeniable joy \u2014 so much so that I found myself using fast travel less frequently than in the previous two games, because movement felt that much more fluid.\nOf the two Spider-Mans, it\u2019s Miles who feels more alive with the possibility to break free of expectation and canon\nNarratively, juggling two Spider-Mans requires a different kind of deftness. Two villains new to the series take center stage \u2014 Kraven the Hunter and Venom \u2014 as well as a returning cast of nearly every villain from the previous two games. Without delving into spoilers, a large majority of that cast is sidelined early on, leaving Kraven and Venom as our principal antagonists, albeit with large roles for returning villains the Lizard (who made a brief appearance in Miles Morales) and Mister Negative. There are others besides them that should delight comic fans, setting up future conflicts for either expansions or the presumed Spider-Man 3 to tackle. If what you come to Spider-Man for is spectacle and villainy, Spider-Man 2 has the goods and then some.\nAs for our heroes, Miles and Peter return from their individual outings for a dramatic team-up. Their two stories are threaded together, allowing for randomized encounters where Peter might show up while you\u2019re playing as Miles (or vice versa), with the two of you tag-teaming a random criminal and slamming them into the ground in what feels like the world\u2019s least fair fight. And yes, they do the Spider-Man-pointing-at-Spider-Man meme in-game. And yes, it is charming the first time (though maybe less so the second). The main story sometimes swaps Spider-Mans mid-mission, as in the dramatic opening sequence where Sandman coats the city in dust as Peter and Miles rush to help firefighters and first responders, with eerie echoes of 9\/11. Side missions often allow either Spider-Man to tackle them, but the main story beats require one or the other, as each hero is allowed his full particularity as a singular Spider-Man.\nPeter\u2019s plot involves a retelling of the Venom origin story, with beats that will be recognizable to those even passingly familiar with the Spider-Man mythos. If Spider-Man 2 is a game of retellings, Peter\u2019s story clings most closely to the canon. If you\u2019ve seen Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man 3, you\u2019ll know the gist of what to expect when the symbiote finds its way to Peter. It isn\u2019t until the late game that Peter\u2019s story starts pushing more strongly against our canonical memories and into something more unique to Insomniac.\nMiles\u2019 story takes more liberties. Hailey Cooper, Miles\u2019 love interest from his solo game, returns here, taking more of an MJ-esque role and carving out her own identity separate from Miles\u2019. American Sign Language is featured heavily throughout Miles\u2019 missions because of Hailey\u2019s presence, feeling as natural and integral to the story as anything from the canon. One of the Miles-specific side quests involves learning about the artistic history of Harlem, and it entwines the real-life histories of Josephine Baker, Langston Hughes, and Charlie Parker with the fictional history of SHIELD and other Marvel properties. An early mission shows off Insomniac\u2019s technical chops with a section that cleverly borrows a trick from Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. Of the two Spider-Mans, it\u2019s Miles who feels more alive with the possibility to break free of expectation and canon.\n[Ed. note: Spoilers follow for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.]\nThe recent Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has an obsession with \u201ccanon events,\u201d pivotal moments in a Spider-Man\u2019s life that the film\u2019s villain, Spider-Man 2099, is dedicated to maintaining across the multiverse. Whether it\u2019s the upside-down kiss, the death of Uncle Ben or Jefferson Davis, or simply the spider bite that starts it all, Spider-Man 2099 believes that upholding these canon events, even the painful ones, is key to preserving the stability of each strand of reality. Miles disagrees, believing it is Spider-Man\u2019s job to resist the seemingly inevitable \u2014 to always do what\u2019s right, not simply what\u2019s preordained. The film ends with a promise of pushing back against Spider-Man 2099, and with it, the established canon.\nI was hungry for Spider-Man 2 to push back in a similar way \u2014 to treat the established story like Angela Carter repurposing \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d to her whims, like Michael Cunningham plumbing \u201cRumpelstiltskin\u201d for a story about the desire to have a child, or like Helen Oyeyemi and her body of work. Or, to give a more mass media example, like Star Wars: Visions, which gives creative leeway to a variety of animators and storytellers to play with the very basics of what makes Star Wars Star Wars.\nSpider-Man 2 doesn\u2019t go quite this far, but where it does go is still satisfyingly slant. Wrinkles to critical characters and plot points will keep even seasoned Spider-fans on their toes. Moreover, it plays like a dream, with smart additions to combat that enhance the power fantasy of being Spider-Man. Each Spider-Man now has a full arsenal of special moves and gadgets that complement one another, making even the most basic combat encounter feel like a choreographed ballet of kicks, thwips, and zaps. The game is beautifully rendered, taking full advantage of the newest PlayStation, with such detailed textures on each unlockable suit that you\u2019d swear they were real, and ray-traced window after ray-traced window in a loving rendition of New York. (If you can get past the Frankenstein-ification of the boroughs, that is. RIP Chelsea.)\nThere are hints of greater thematic aspirations within Spider-Man 2. Questions about mass incarceration, recidivism, and reintegration into society for formerly incarcerated people; worries about the surveillance state and what we give up when we engage with modern technology. These things appear, however fleetingly, in Spider-Man 2, but there isn\u2019t enough time to elaborate on any single one in the unrelenting march of set-piece after glorious set-piece.\nBut I\u2019m glad they\u2019re there, anyway. Because if we\u2019re going to retell a story, we ought to retell it anew. Canons were made to be broken, and Spider-Man 2 swings in that direction. With a sequel teed up by the game\u2019s final act, I\u2019m eager to see where Insomniac goes with that momentum. Next stop: the Bronx.\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 will be released Oct. 20 on PlayStation 5. The game was reviewed using a pre-release download code provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

{"title":"Temu was the most-downloaded iPhone app in the U.S. in 2023","context":"## Temu was the most-downloaded iPhone app in the U.S. in 2023\n\nTemu, the Chinese e-commerce company whose app is now attracting longer engagement times than Amazon, is Apple\u2019s most downloaded free app in the U.S. for 2023. The Cupertino-based tech giant today released an App Store feature that showcases the top iPhone apps of the year, free and paid, as measured by app installs \u2014 its proxy for overall popularity. This year, apps from Chinese-based companies have taken over spots previously held by U.S. tech giants like Meta and Google, as CapCut and TikTok, which hail from Beijing-based ByteDance, came in at No. 3 and No. 5, respectively.\nMeta, which last year held the No. 3, No. 4 and No. 9 spots with WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, respectively, showed up in the top 10 this year with a slightly different mix. Gone from the charts is Facebook, while Meta\u2019s new app Instagram Threads was the No. 3 app by U.S. downloads. Instagram and WhatsApp followed at No. 6 and No. 9, slipping in position from their ranking last year.\nGoogle, meanwhile, had dominated last year\u2019s list with the No. 2 app YouTube, just behind TikTok, as well as No. 5 Google Maps, No. 6 Google Search and No. 7 Gmail. In 2023, however, Google\u2019s only two apps in the top 10 by downloads included No. 7 Google Search and No. 8 YouTube, both also slipping in ranking from last year.\nThe shift in downloads could represent that U.S. tech giants are nearly at a market saturation point, where their apps aren\u2019t as in demand as they were in previous years because many already have them installed. It also points to the growing demand for apps from Chinese firms, like ByteDance, which are attracting younger users\u2019 attention along with government scrutiny, with TikTok being banned from a number of government devices over concerns about its China ties. Montana also attempted to ban TikTok in its state, but that ruling was put on hold by the courts for the time being as TikTok\u2019s lawsuit progresses.\nThe negative attention TikTok has received in the year may account for its slip from being the No. 1 app last year to now the No. 5 app. But U.S. consumers haven\u2019t sworn off Chinese apps by the looks of things, given Temu\u2019s No. 1 position. Data from Apptopia, reported by Bloomberg, noted that consumers were spending 18 minutes per day in Temu\u2019s app, compared with 10 minutes in Amazon. Younger users spent even higher amounts of time, at 19 minutes per day, on average. While Temu attracts users with in-app games, its real draw may be its bargain prices \u2014 which have more of an appeal during an economic downturn. It\u2019s also a heavily-marketed app, just as TikTok was in the months leading up to its No. 1 ranking last year.\nThe only other top app in the list not from Meta, Google or a Chinese firm was Max (formerly HBO Max), which showed up as the No. 3 app by downloads in the U.S.\nThe top paid apps list showcases a different market, more often of smaller developers or those building useful productivity tools, creative apps or utilities that users are willing to pay for. Here, the top 10 included (in order): Shadowrocket, HotSchedules, Procreate Pocket, The Wonder Weeks, 75 Hard, AutoSleep Track Sleep on Watch, Goblin Tools, TonalEnergy Tuner & Metronome, SkyView and AnkiMobile Flashcards.\nThe top free games, meanwhile, included several of last year\u2019s winners, like Roblox, Call of Duty: Mobile, Subway Surfers and Parking Jam 3D, as well as some new additions. This list\u2019s No.1 app was MONOPOLY GO!, followed by Roblox (up from No. 3 last year), Royal Match, Subway Surfers (down from No. 2 last year), Gardenscapes, Call of Duty: Mobile (up from No. 8 last year), Block Blast!, Makeover Studio: Makeup Games, Parking Jam 3D (ranked the same as last year) and Survivor!.io.\nThe top paid games in the U.S. were led by Microsoft-owned Minecraft, and also included Heads Up!, Geometry Dash, Bloons TD 6, MONOPOLY, Papa\u2019s Freezeria To Go!, Plague Inc., Red\u2019s First Flight, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s (which became a movie this year, too) and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\nApple\u2019s feature also includes separate lists of the top iPad apps and games, both free and paid, for the year, as well as top Apple Arcade games. The latter offers the only glimpse into Apple\u2019s subscription gaming store, which is otherwise a black box as it doesn\u2019t feature a Top Charts section like the larger App Store does.\nThere\u2019s some overlap in these lists, though streaming apps make a better showing among the free iPad apps. That list includes (in order) Max, YouTube and Netflix in the top three spots and Disney+, Prime Video and Peacock at No. 5, 8 and 10, respectively. Top iPad games also include more kid-friendly titles, like Toca Life: Hospital (No. 5) and Teach Your Monster to Read (No. 7).\nThe complete set of lists are below:\nTop Free iPhone Apps\nTemu: Shop Like a Billionaire CapCut \u2013 Video Editor Max: Stream HBO, TV, & Movies Threads, an Instagram app TikTok Instagram Google YouTube: Watch, Listen, Stream WhatsApp Messenger Gmail \u2013 Email by Google\nTop Paid iPhone Apps\nShadowrocket HotSchedules Procreate Pocket The Wonder Weeks 75 Hard AutoSleep Track Sleep on Watch Goblin Tools TonalEnergy Tuner & Metronome SkyView AnkiMobile Flashcards\nTop Free iPhone Games\nMONOPOLY GO!

{"title":"U.S.-China relations are now more about crisis prevention","context":"## U.S.-China relations are now more about crisis prevention\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping as they meet on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit in Bali, Indonesia, November 14, 2022. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters\nBEIJING \u2014 After another rocky year of U.S.-China tensions, the two countries' presidents are set to meet this week in person for the second time since Joe Biden took office. It will be a rare summit before the U.S. presidential election cycle kicks off in earnest. Taking a tough stance on China, the second-largest economy in the world, has become one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement. Biden plans to run for reelection. \"The focus will be on expanding dialogue in order to low[er] tail risks in the relationship and prevent a crisis that neither leader is looking for,\" said Michael Hirson, head of China Research at 22V Research. \"Flashpoints such as Taiwan and the South China Sea need to be managed carefully,\" he said. \"For that reason the meeting is still important, especially ahead of a politically charged 2024 that will begin with an important presidential election in Taiwan in January and end with the U.S. presidential election.\" U.S.-China tensions have escalated over the last several years, beginning with tariffs under the Trump administration and spilling over into broader tech restrictions under the Biden administration.\nwatch now\nControversy in early February over an alleged Chinese spy balloon flying in U.S. airspace revealed how fragile relations have become \u2014 the incident pushed the two countries to suspend already limited high-level talks. In April, during that period of estrangement, Washington, D.C.-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies published a report that described U.S.-China relations as seemingly \"caught in a worsening vicious cycle.\" \"This translates into a stalemate\u2014and, in fact, spiraling tensions\u2014that go even further than the typical 'security dilemma,' in which each side takes steps to defend itself which in turn generate insecurity for the other, who then responds in kind,\" the report said.\nThe immediate aftermath of the [Biden-Xi] meeting is likely to mark a cyclical high point for bilateral relations Gabriel Wildau Teneo\nSentiment began to improve over the summer after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken finally made a high-stakes visit to Beijing in June, followed by visits from several other senior officials. In early October, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and five other U.S. senators representing both the Republican and Democratic parties had an 80-minute meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But both sides are still waiting for more action. \"The current trend in China-U.S. relations is one of easing,\" said Shen Yamei, director of the department for American Studies and an associate research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies. \"This easing is a relaxation of the atmosphere,\" she said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. \"No actual changes have occurred.\" She pointed out, however, that the establishment of many new communication channels means there is much to look forward to.\nExport controls\nDuring this week's meeting, Shen expects the Chinese side to bring up U.S. export controls and investment restrictions. The Biden administration has restricted U.S. companies from selling high-end tech, primarily in semiconductors, to Chinese companies and sought to curb U.S. investments in such Chinese tech. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in a trip in August had \"said no\" to China's requests to reduce the controls and called the them \"matters of national security.\" Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng also raised the issues during preparatory meetings with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in San Francisco on Nov. 10, according to state media. \"Aside from Taiwan, export controls are Beijing's top concern, but there is no political space in Washington roll back existing controls,\" Gabriel Wildau, managing director at consulting firm Teneo, said in a note. \"The immediate aftermath of the [Biden-Xi] meeting is likely to mark a cyclical high point for bilateral relations,\" he said. \"The key question is whether this high point extends into a plateau or whether political pressures trigger a new cycle of deterioration,\" he said. \"As previously discussed, the period since June has offered a window of opportunity to stabilize relations; following the meeting, this window may close.\" Taiwan is set to hold its presidential election in January, and a more pro-independence winner could stir more of Beijing's ire. Beijing considers Taiwan part of its territory, with no right to independently conduct diplomatic relations. The U.S. recognizes Beijing as the sole government of China but maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan, a democratically self-governed island. While speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in August 2021, Nancy Pelosi became the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Taiwan in 25 years. The trip prompted Beijing to suspend talks on climate with the U.S., one of the few areas of potential cooperation.\nAreas of cooperation\nThe Biden administration has said the U.S. is in competition with China, while looking to ensure that it \"does not veer into conflict.\" \"The Biden-Xi meeting might include a pledge to cooperate or establish a new formal bilateral working group on safe use of artificial intelligence,\" Teneo's Wildau said. He added that \"the two leaders may pledge to cooperate and coordinate on providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, ensure smooth passage of grain through the Black Sea, and support postwar reconstruction in Gaza and Ukraine.\" The U.S. remains China's largest trading partner on a single-country basis. However, Shen pointed out that trust between the U.S. and China is still quite low. \"No one believes what [the other] says now,\" she said.\nwatch now\nPaving the way\nGoodwill efforts have increased in the weeks leading up to the planned summit on Wednesday local time between Biden and Xi in San Francisco, alongside the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. For example, more direct flights between the U.S. and China are resuming from a low base. Chinese commodity importers in October signed the first agreements since 2017 to buy U.S. agricultural products in bulk, according to a release from the U.S. embassy in Beijing. China's Ministry of Commerce last week announced it was gathering information in an effort to address unequal treatment of foreign businesses in China versus domestic ones \u2014 a longstanding business complaint. However, on the cultural front, the three remaining giant pandas in the U.S. on loan from Beijing returned to China last week due to an expiring contract. China has lent pandas to countries around the world as a diplomatic tool.\n\nThis article was published by Cnbc | World Business News Leader on 2023-11-13 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":385}
{"title":"Monday Night Football DraftKings Picks: NFL DFS lineup advice for Week 15 Eagles-Seahawks Showdown tournaments","context":"## Monday Night Football DraftKings Picks: NFL DFS lineup advice for Week 15 Eagles-Seahawks Showdown tournaments\n\nThe Seahawks are just about hanging on by a thread. At 6-7, the team is on the outside looking in when it comes to the playoff picture. A win on Monday night against the suddenly reeling Eagles could be a big boost in their chances going forward -- a matchup that is actually a pretty good one after looking beneath the surface. The Eagles come in as losers of two straight, losing in blowout fashion both times no less. Suddenly the sky is falling as the Cowboys have taken over the NFC East division lead, complicating matters as the regular season winds down. The sense of urgency for both sides means we are looking at two teams with plenty to lose, setting up for a fun Monday night under the lights at Lumen Field.\nBefore we get into our lineup and strategy, here are the key scoring settings for DraftKings Showdown contests: They're full-point PPR and there are three-point bonuses for 300 passing yards, 100 rushing yards, and 100 receiving yards. The Captain pick costs 1.5 times a player's original price, but he also gets his point total multiplied by 1.5.\nEagles-Seahawks DraftKings Picks: DFS lineup for Week 15 Monday Night Football\n$50,000 budget, need at least one player from each team.\nCaptain (1.5x points, 1.5x salary): WR DK Metcalf, Seahawks ($14,400)\nThe Eagles secondary issues are well-documented at this stage and they'll be made even worse with the absence of CB Darius Slay (knee) in Seattle on Monday night. Metcalf has four touchdowns in his last two games, including a three TD game against a stout Cowboys defense. The receiver has been prone to being undisciplined on the field, however, resulting in an ejection against the 49ers last week. That is always a concern when trusting Metcalf, but we take the good with the bad since the ceiling is so high. No matter who ends up starting at QB, the WR is in line for another dominant showing against one of the league's most generous secondaries.\nFLEX QB Geno Smith, Seahawks ($9,400)\nMetcalf won't be throwing the ball to himself and he's not one to get opportunities in the running game, meaning that someone will be setting him up for success. And since Smith appears ready to play, he finds himself with a spot in our lineup. In the event that he doesn't play, however, we will turn to Drew Lock ($9,200) in his place. Regardless, the Seattle quarterbacks are set up for success and should be able to light up the skies on Monday night. Take the chance to stack QB1 and WR1 from the home side.\nFLEX WR DeVonta Smith, Eagles ($9,000)\nMost of the attention will continue to be focused on A.J. Brown, but what about the reliable Smith? He's quietly been the more productive option over the last three weeks, totaling 62.5 fantasy points to just 54.5 from Brown. Seattle's secondary was torched by San Francisco last week, allowing both Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel to go over the century mark. And for all the credit that the Eagles get for having a great team, they are a fairly top-heavy bunch. There's no clear WR3 behind Brown and Smith, meaning the opportunities will be aplenty. Expect that big workload to continue for a receiver that's sometimes forgotten in Philly.\nFLEX RB D'Andre Swift, Eagles ($8,000)\nThe message to the Eagles has been clear from the fans -- run the ball. It's part of what made this team so hard to beat earlier in the season. They've become a pass-happy offense in recent history, relying mostly on the legs and arm of Jalen Hurts to do everything. After getting smacked by the Cowboys last week, the Eagles weren't afforded the opportunity to establish the run. That will be a point of emphasis this time around, especially since Hurts is dealing with an illness. It's been three weeks since Swift had any kind of impact. That needs to change if the Eagles want to get back on track.\nFLEX TE Dallas Goedert, Eagles ($6,200)\nOne of the players that should help this team get-right is Goedert. The TE is healthy once again, having returned against the Cowboys last week and settled in nicely by collecting all four targets for 30 yards. We mentioned earlier the lack of a true WR3 for Philly, but that is essentially Goedert's role with the lack of WR depth. As a trusted option in the passing game, Goedert should find success against a defense that's been shredded by TEs in back-to-back weeks.\nFLEX TE Noah Fant, Seahawks ($2,600)\nFant rounds out the lineup as a fine sleeper option against a defense that's struggled to contain TEs at times throughout this season. He likely needs a touchdown to make a real impact, but we can pencil in Fant for around four targets in an offense that seemingly loves to throw touchdowns to random TEs. Considering the state of our budget at this point, we're taking a shot on Fant to deliver as a short-yardage option with the Eagles' pass rush threatening to make life difficult.\nMORE DK SHOWDOWN: How to win a Showdown contest\nBest SuperDraft Eagles-Seahawks DFS Picks\nThis year, we're also listing our favorite single-game DFS plays on SuperDraft.\nFor those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.\nWin BIG with SuperDraft! Join now and get a free deposit match of $20!\nHere are the most notable scoring rules for SuperDraft NFL contests: Half-point PPR, four-point passing TDs, two-point bonuses for 100 rushing yards, 100 receiving yards, and 300 passing yards.\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS: How to play SuperDraft\nChampion (+50% points): WR DK Metcalf, Seahawks (Multiplier 1.8x)\nSuper FLEX: QB Geno Smith, Seahawks (Multiplier 1.2x)\nSuper FLEX: QB Jalen Hurts, Eagles (Multiplier 1x)\nSuper FLEX: WR A.J. Brown, Eagles (Multiplier 1.05x)\nSuper FLEX: WR DeVonta Smith, Eagles (Multiplier 1.25x)\nOur SuperDraft lineup for Monday night's game is going all-in on the passing attacks for both sides. We're carrying our Smith-Metcalf stack over to the SuperDraft side of things, but the lack of a budget allows us to get Hurts along with Brown and the Eagles' Smith to stack things on the opposite sideline too. We envision plenty of production through the air despite both team's desire to run the ball.\n\nThis article, authored by Nick Brinkerhoff, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-18 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":386}
{"title":"5 things to know before watching the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s movie","context":"## 5 things to know before watching the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s movie\n\nThe possessed-animatronics horror video game Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s is less than a decade old, but a movie version has been in the works almost since the game launched, which seems especially protracted for a development process. Warner Bros. bought the movie rights in 2015, and the project moved over to Blumhouse a couple of years later. Game creator Scott Cawthon wrote and rewrote the script, while kid-horror filmmakers like Gil Kenan (Monster House) and Chris Columbus (Gremlins, the first Harry Potter and Percy Jackson movies) signed on and jumped off the project.\nFinally, under director Emma Tammi, the film is hitting theaters simultaneously with a Peacock streaming debut. The franchise\u2019s most hardcore fans probably consider themselves beyond ready to watch the Freddy\u2019s film. But what about everyone else? If you\u2019re not sure, have a look at this handy (and extremely spoiler-light) Q&A. We don\u2019t dig into the considerable lore behind FNAF here \u2014 there are endless YouTube videos for that. We\u2019re mostly talking about who this film is for and what to expect.\nDoes Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s have a post-credits scene?\nYes. More specifically, it has a brief mid-credits scene that rolls less than a minute after the initial cut to black. It isn\u2019t integral to the movie\u2019s lore, and doesn\u2019t feel like a sequel tease, though it certainly could be elaborated on in a sequel. It\u2019s more of a comic scene involving YouTuber and horror-game aficionado Cory DeVante \u201cCoryxKenshin\u201d Williams, though he doesn\u2019t seem to be playing himself. But as far as a true post-credits scene that actually plays at the tail end of the credit roll, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s doesn\u2019t have one \u2014 just a brief, not especially exciting audio-only Easter egg.\nCan you enjoy Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s if you haven\u2019t played the games?\nAt a Blumhouse panel for the recent New York Comic Con, producer Jason Blum explained that he thinks a lot of adaptations \u2014 books, comics, and games alike \u2014 falter when creators try to simultaneously please hardcore fans and remain accessible to new audiences. According to Blum, his company finally cracked Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s by deciding not to make it with new audiences in mind. In other words, they ultimately decided to just please the fans.\nIt was a clear applause-bait line at a convention filled to the brim with, yes, fans. But that doesn\u2019t mean the movie is hard to follow. It starts from scratch, mimicking the premise of the first game: A guy named Mike (Josh Hutcherson) is hired as overnight security guard for an abandoned Chuck E. Cheese-style arcade restaurant, and encounters some animatronics with strange and eerie origins. There\u2019s no comics-style backstory that demands pre-movie study.\nStill, complete newcomers checking out the movie to see what the fuss is about may be confused for other reasons. The movie\u2019s backstory is parceled out awkwardly, in ways that are sometimes confusing. Characters\u2019 decisions don\u2019t always make sense. And there\u2019s as much family melodrama as thrill-ride scares. There isn\u2019t much you can do about it except assure yourself that any confusion you experience in watching it isn\u2019t just you. The movie is kind of weird, and not because of some missing fan-only information that unlocks all its inconsistencies. The for-the-fans vibe Blum described applies more to whether the average person will care about this story, not whether they can understand it.\nWill Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s experts enjoy the movie more?\nLongtime fans hungering for an exploration or expansion of the game series\u2019 continuing mythology should prepare themselves to see something more simplified. Typical enough for an adaptation, some of the more complicated lore has been stripped out, though it could probably be reintroduced in any sequel. This does make the movie more accessible for franchise newcomers, whether Blum wanted that or not.\nAlso, fans might expect more screen time than they actually get for the core animatronics team of Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Carl the Cupcake.\nIs Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s safe for kids?\nFor an ostensible horror franchise \u2014 one based on nostalgia for and subversion of animatronic characters that date to the 1980s \u2014 the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s games have a surprising amount of young fans. Its kid appeal is an echo of a time when playgrounds were alight with elementary school kids describing the antics of Freddy and\/or Jason, whether witnessed firsthand or pieced together from rumors. Unlike A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, however, Freddy\u2019s is rated PG-13, rather than R.\nSo is it really as kid-friendly as other PG-13 IP movies, like Aquaman or Captain Marvel? That will depend a lot on the kid in question, of course, but the movie is far from an unrelenting thrill ride. It isn\u2019t as intense as fellow PG-13 horror movies The Ring or Drag Me to Hell. The most ghoulish aspects of the Freddy\u2019s backstory are kept off screen or entirely unmentioned, and none of its set-pieces seem like pure nightmare fuel. Several of the titular five nights pass without much incident at all.\nThat said, there are plentiful cheap music-sting jump scares and a few gruesome bits of junior-level gore. Violence-wise, this is a harder PG-13 than your average superhero movie, which will probably only entice its younger YouTube-versed fans even more. Again, every kid is different, but generally speaking, that 12 or 13 age cutoff is probably about right.\nWasn\u2019t there already a horror movie about evil animatronics?\nYes! Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s took so long to get the movie treatment that it was actually lapped by a spirited knockoff. Willy\u2019s Wonderland doesn\u2019t have nearly so much lore as the FNAF games, but its premise is basically One Night at Cage\u2019s, with Nicolas Cage playing a man hired to serve as an overnight janitor at a haunted Chuck E. Cheese-type location. As expected, the interesting element of the movie is Cage\u2019s performance \u2014 especially because it\u2019s entirely dialogue-free, muting one of Cage\u2019s most distinctive features as an actor.\nThe novelty isn\u2019t quite enough for Willy\u2019s Wonderland to reach the upper echelon of Cage\u2019s last decade, but hardcore fans of either the actor or the concept might enjoy the strange combination of a unique movie-star brand with an off-brand version of the famous game series. And a total Five Nights novice might even prefer the sillier, shorter Cage version.\n\nThis article, authored by Jesse Hassenger, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-26 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":387}
{"title":"Blue Halloween buckets for autism: What they mean and why they're sparking controversy","context":"## Blue Halloween buckets for autism: What they mean and why they're sparking controversy\n\nFor most kids, Halloween is all about how much candy they can stuff in their bags or buckets.\nBut for some kids, such as those with autism, the activity can be a little more daunting.\nThe blue Halloween bucket trend first started in 2018, when Louisiana mom Alicia Plumer took to Facebook indicating that her son, who has autism, would be carrying a blue bucket to indicate his disability.\nBLUE HALLOWEEN BUCKETS RAISE AUTISM AWARENESS, MOM'S VIRAL POST SAYS\n\"If you see someone who appears to be an adult dressed up to trick-or-treat this year carrying this blue bucket, he\u2019s our son!\" she wrote. \"His name is BJ & he is autistic. While he has the body of a 21-year-old, he loves Halloween.\"\nShe added, \"Please help us keep his spirit alive and happy. So when you see the blue bucket, share a piece of candy. Spread awareness! These precious people are not \u2018too big\u2019 to trick-or-treat.\"\nAnother mom, Omairis Taylor, wrote in a 2019 Facebook post that many neighbors expected her nonverbal, autistic son to say \"trick-or-treat\" to earn candy, leading the mother to explain over and over why he was unable to do so.\nMany Facebook users praised the idea of the blue bucket, one commenting how it is \"one more tool to broaden the scope of understanding.\"\n'OUTGROWING' AUTISM? FOR SOME KIDS, THE DISORDER SEEMS TO DISAPPEAR BY AGE 6, \u2018ENCOURAGING\u2019 STUDY FINDS\nParents across the country and retailers like Walmart have since joined in buying and selling blue Halloween baskets to raise awareness for trick-or-treaters with autism.\nThe National Autism Association recognized the movement as well, warning in a 2020 blog post that not all parents find the color coding necessary.\nSome parents are concerned that blue buckets unnecessarily point out their child\u2019s disability, and could even make them a target for abuse.\nThe argument continues this Halloween season, with some X users pointing out the controversy.\nLOS ANGELES MOM SAY KIDS WITH AUTISM DON'T NEED \u2018FIXING,\u2019 URGES GREATER UNDERSTANDING AMID SPIKE IN CASES\n\"DO NOT BUY YOUR CHILDREN BLUE HALLOWEEN PUMPKIN BUCKETS,\" one X user posted on Monday.\n\"This idea, aside from being horribly ableist, as it's intended to denote the child as \u2018different\u2019 (read: autistic) harms children w\/dietary needs.

But we don't need blue pumpkin buckets for Halloween. Non-verbal kids don't need to be identified during a fun holiday, they just want to participate like everyone else.\"\nParenting expert and child psychologist Dr. Michele Borba commented on the controversy, telling Fox News Digital that it\u2019s \"always advisable not to label a child \u2014 unless it\u2019s for a positive reason.\"\nCALIFORNIA MAN WITH SEVERE AUTISM BEATS RUBIK'S CUBE WORLD RECORD: \u2018EXUBERANCE IN OUR HEARTS\u2019\n\"Negative labels can impact a child\u2019s self-confidence,\" said the California-based psychologist. \"But no one knows a child better than a parent.\"\nBorba suggested that parents should consider whether the label hurts or helps their child interact with others.\n\"For instance, is the child speech delayed? Does he have difficulty interacting with others or expressing his needs? Are others (including his peers) aware of the child\u2019s challenges?\" she questioned.\n\"The ultimate goal is for the child to have a fun Halloween,\" Borba said. \"The parents should never be concerned about others\u2019 responses; only do what is best for [the] child.\"\nKelley Coleman, Los Angeles-based author of the upcoming book, \"Everything No One Tells You About Parenting a Disabled Child,\" echoed this sentiment, emphasizing to Fox News Digital how Halloween should \"always be about your child.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nFor parents considering using a blue bucket, Coleman \u2014 who is also the mother of an autistic son \u2014 advised others to take their children's safety, comfort and privacy into consideration.\n\"Especially for children trick-or-treating without parents directly at their side \u2014 is it the safest option to have your child carrying a bright indicator of their disability?\" she asked.\n\"For children who prefer privacy, would they want that information broadcasted? For children who prefer to share their neurodivergence, perhaps this is something they are proud to display.\"\nThe conversation should be between child and parent, Coleman stressed, regardless of communication level, and should \"center their experience and preferences.\"\n\"The blue bucket can be a teaching tool for others; however, it should never be about others \u2014 it should always be about your child.\"\n\"In an ideal world, all adults would understand that not everyone communicates the same way, and that one's ability to communicate does not indicate one's interest in candy,\" she said. \"But, the reality is that not all adults know this.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"It's exhausting teaching others to be inclusive,\" Coleman added. \"So, yes, the blue bucket can be a teaching tool for others; however, it should never be about others \u2014 it should always be about your child.\"\nMadeline Farber contributed to this report.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Lifestyle on 2023-10-31 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":388}
{"title":"How queerness became calamity in Tears of the Kingdom","context":"## How queerness became calamity in Tears of the Kingdom\n\nMany players have celebrated The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the space it made to find queer expression in Hyrule. Its story provided just enough possibility space for players to explore in ways that did not conform to its developers\u2019 intent. But stepping into Hyrule Field again in Tears of the Kingdom, I felt much more constrained.\nPlayers have been looking for gender in this generation\u2019s iteration of Link since before Breath of the Wild released. Donning his tunic\u2019s now iconic champion blue, Link\u2019s androgyny in the game\u2019s very first teaser trailer back in 2014 stirred mainstream audiences to scrutinize the player character\u2019s presumed gender. And as early as that had come into question, so too did the character\u2019s entire identity. The idea of a female Hero of Time simmered. And if the character shown wasn\u2019t Link, then maybe it was a playable Zelda.\nNintendo would eventually address the speculation: Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said that nothing so revolutionary as a woman was in the works, explaining that changing Link\u2019s gender would \u201cmess with the balance of the Triforce,\u201d while focusing instead on Zelda as a playable female character would leave Link with nothing to do. \u201cIf we have princess Zelda as the main character who fights,\u201d Aonuma asked, \u201cthen what is Link going to do?\u201d\nThese assumptions and their casual misogyny reveal that particular kinds of gender are a priori to the very land and cosmos of Hyrule \u2014 that the Triforce both represents and enshrines the subordination of women to men in the kingdom\u2019s religion, and that courage and power must only be an essential trait of men. Many fans have been disappointed in Zelda\u2019s continued sidelining, while the developer has been content to give Zelda little to do in her eponymous games. While his developers imagine Link as a blank slate for players of all identities, Sarah Stang contends that Link\u2019s gender expression has never been incorporated into that vision. \u201cThough featuring an androgynous protagonist can be viewed as progressive in a Western context,\u201d she argues, \u201cLink\u2019s design fits in with Japanese cultural preferences and was therefore not an overly risky choice for Nintendo.\u201d\nBreath of the Wild\u2019s gender trouble continued closer to release, as a series of leaked screenshots revealed Link\u2019s encounter with the character Vilia outside of Gerudo Town, the all-female city in Hyrule\u2019s desert. The screenshots suggested a transphobic punchline about crossdressing, and the game would deliver on the joke (the quest being a necessary step to completing the game\u2019s true ending). But when the game was released weeks later, players went on to find queer expression and even joy in the wilds of Hyrule. A crossdressing Link was genuinely embraced among artists, cosplayers, and authors of fan fiction, and queer expressions were captured in poetry, art and prose.\nAll of which is why I find Tears of The Kingdom so damning \u2014 it denies such space for imagination. Its narrative is ultimately not just a perpetuation of Hyrule\u2019s status quo, but it introduces new constraints that deny queer subtext and even expression where once there was room before. And we can tease out these changes by going back to the fulcrum of gender discourse in Breath of the Wild: Gerudo Town.\nGerudo Town is a gendered and raced space unlike the other settlements on the periphery of Hyrule. Alongside the bird people, fish people, and rock people, the Gerudo are a vaguely Arabic or North African-coded, all female, matriarchal society. Their culture is a site of friction and humor in both games. The Gerudo are at once obsessed with and scornful of men, found on pilgrimages to find their one true love, a monogamous myth perpetuated by their own teachings, or else behind the walls of their single-gender desert city.\nWomen of all races (and the apparently genderless Gorons) are welcome in Gerudo Town, while men are prevented from entering by armed guard. In Breath of the Wild, many still try their luck, with several characters\u2019 whole personalities being a one-note joke about how it\u2019s funny to watch men chase after women when they wish to be left alone. But the Gerudo do not themselves police gender. Vilia, who can be read as a trans woman, is said to be welcomed in the city, and Link is welcomed in when he dons their attire. He seems comfortable, if bashful, when he first puts on the clothes. Moreover, when Link reveals himself at the city\u2019s health-replenishing spa, the innkeeper Romah implores him to relax. \u201cWe\u2019re all vai here,\u201d she assures, using the fictional language\u2019s word for \u201cwoman.\u201d Many more compliment Link\u2019s appearance in strictly feminine terms. As both the Gerudo chieftain Riju and armor shopkeep Greta address Link as if he\u2019s in disguise, we can infer that many perhaps see Link as a non-conforming person moving through the city.\nThe presence of a black-market armor shop further denies any gender essentialist notions like the ones that suggest Vilia is a man dressed as a woman. In Breath of the Wild, the shop\u2019s covert dealings of Gerudo armor for men suggests that there must be men in the all-female race, leaving one to assume trans men may be born of the Gerudo and, while not sanctioned in the city, are integrated into their material culture. But Tears of the Kingdom does away with almost all of the queer subtext brimming just beneath Breath of the Wild\u2019s surface.\nVilia is one of a handful of named characters missing from Tears of the Kingdom, and there is no mention of her memory. The armor she gifted Link, which was once previously for sale in Gerudo Town\u2019s market, is also conspicuously absent, just one of a few pieces of clothing to not return to the game. Instead, the game\u2019s main quest takes players into a derelict Gerudo Town. Link must again infiltrate their sanctum (now an underground bunker), but this time he is welcomed as a man amongst the sheltering women. Moving through the now underground settlement, Link is greeted with suspicion and novelty to the sheltered children who have not seen men before, and he\u2019s treated as a presumed threat for his proximity. Gerudo Town previously rejected essentialist logics like the idea men are inherently dangerous to women \u2014 which undergirds real-world transphobia \u2014 but here it simply invokes such beliefs in much less humorous tones than it did even in Vilia\u2019s quest.\nAnd outside of town, a Hylian man mentions to Link that he\u2019s looking for a black market armor shop that sells voe (Gerudo for \u201cman\u201d) armor. The change transforms queer materials into something more like cultural tchotchkes, further denying the queer subtext of trans masculinity and furthering the sense of Orientalism pervading the Gerudo.\nTears of the Kingdom does introduce new armor sets that can play with expression, but none are explicitly feminine. Most are Zonai in origin, a fictional ancient culture that borrows heavily from pan-Mesoamerican and Egyptian imagery. As such, it\u2019s hard to read their skirts and body paint as feminine when these were features of masculine presentation to their cultures. I guess there is the one-off Cece\u2019s Hat, designed by a Hylian in Hateno, but it lacks a matching set of top and bottoms. So, there\u2019s nothing really replacing the gender nonconformity that the vai armor introduced in Breath of the Wild. But this would perhaps be less notable if Link\u2019s gender presentation wasn\u2019t so ridiculed across Hyrule.\nWhat pervades the land in place of calamity is not the evil of Ganon, but of gender deviance. In Tears of the Kingdom, characters often make jokes emasculating Link. At one stable, a Lurelin refugee laughs at the notion that \u201ca skinny little guy\u201d might attempt to rescue his village, while a Gerudo pilgrim jokes with Link that he couldn\u2019t possibly be her destined lover. More than one Gerudo remarks on his short stature, while others reject the notion he may be the famed hero of time because he\u2019s so short. The Great Fairy Mija, however fond of him, describes Link as \u201ca slim little lad\u201d in what is framed as a backhanded compliment. These comments envelop Hyrule with gendered expectations, much like gendered beauty standards and social norms do in our own world.\nIt turns out queer joy was only accepted in the empty, unstructured wilds of a Hyrule beholden to calamity. But in a world that has been filled by side quests and the new settlements of a monarchy reborn, there is no need for a hero who wears a skirt like a girl. Tears of the Kingdom presents a Hyrule where the Triforce rests not in the trinity of the spiritual aspects of Power, Courage, and Wisdom, but instead in the gender binary.\n\nThis article, authored by Autumn Wright, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-19 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":389}

Ketamine does not generally cause death from cardiac or respiratory effects, but rather from associated injury.\"\nMATTHEW PERRY CAUSE OF DEATH LISTED AS 'ACUTE EFFECTS OF KETAMINE'\nDr. Bankole Johnson, CEO and founder of Casa Priv\u00e9e in Miami , a concierge medical facility, offers ketamine infusion therapy to help patients manage various conditions.\nHe told Fox News Digital that in his opinion, Perry\u2019s death likely was linked to recreational ketamine use, although he did not treat or examine the actor.\nExperts shared with Fox News Digital the following common myths and misconceptions about the drug.\nMyth No. 1: Ketamine is a new treatment\nIn reality, the drug has been used for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and pain for more than 10 years, according to Dr. Patrick Sullivan, medical director of Initia Nova Medical Solutions in New Jersey .\nThe FDA approved ketamine for anesthesia in both humans and animals since 1970, the doctor noted.\nAfter successful clinical trials , the FDA approved the drug in 2019 as a medication for treatment-resistant depression.\nOZEMPIC AND WEGOVY WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS COULD HELP REDUCE ALCOHOL USE DISORDER SYMPTOMS, STUDY SUGGESTS\n\"There are hundreds of studies showing it to be safe and effective in the outpatient setting,\" Sullivan told Fox News Digital.\nMyth No. 2: Ketamine is powerfully addictive\nKetamine is \"legally recognized as having the potential for abuse and for both psychological and physical dependence,\" according to the American Addiction Centers website.\nJohnson, however, noted that ketamine is a \"moderately addictive substance.\"\nHe told Fox News Digital, \"Even long-term users typically only develop a behavioral or psychological dependence. Physical dependence can occur, but usually the withdrawal signs are mild to moderate.\"\nDr. Sandhya Prashad, president of the American Society Of Ketamine Physicians, Psychotherapists and Practitioners (ASKP3) in Florida, said there is \"an extremely low risk of addiction, craving or withdrawal\" when ketamine is used in low doses in a monitored clinical setting.\n\"Abuse of ketamine occurs when it is self-administered in high or frequent doses without supervision or monitoring, which leads to addiction ,\" she told Fox News Digital.\nMyth No 3: Ketamine can be self-prescribed and purchased online\nKetamine should only be obtained and administered by a licensed and experienced medical doctor, Johnson said.\n\"To use ketamine, it is important to establish a clear diagnosis of severe depression or anxiety and\/or post-traumatic stress disorder,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"This requires an expert and cannot be self-diagnosed properly.\"\n\"Abuse of ketamine occurs when it is self-administered in high or frequent doses without supervision or monitoring, which leads to addiction.\"\nThose who think they may benefit from ketamine treatment should consult a doctor, Johnson advised.\n\"Ketamine is generally safe when administered by trained health professionals in a medical setting,\" Johnson said.\n\"In those settings, it is best delivered by the IV route, where the dose can be calculated accurately.\"\nWhen purchasing ketamine outside a doctor\u2019s prescription, there is also the risk of receiving a tainted product, experts warned. While people might assume they're purchasing straight ketamine, the drug is often mixed with stimulants like cocaine or phencyclidine (PCP), Johnson noted.\nULTRAPROCESSED FOODS WITH \u2018FEEL-GOOD CHEMICALS\u2019 COULD BE AS ADDICTIVE AS CIGARETTES AND DRUGS, STUDY SUGGESTS\n\"These can produce strong cardiac effects of a very high blood pressure and pulse, and can lead to serious medical complications,\" he said.\nMyth No. 4: Intranasal or micro-dosing is safe for recreational use\nWhile using small doses of ketamine may seem safer than the larger doses given via IV, Johnson warned that when this drug is self-administered, there is a danger of exceeding safe limits.\n\"The total cumulative dose could end up being higher than a standard dose of a medically administered intravenous dose,\" he told Fox News Digital.\nIntranasal use can also lead to \"more aggressive drug-seeking\" behaviors, Johnson warned, as the \"high\" of taking the ketamine is paired with cues in the user\u2019s environment \u2014 which are not present in a medical office.\nLike other medications, such as opiates or benzodiazepines, ketamine has the potential to be abused, Sullivan agreed.\n\"Ketamine should only be used within the confines of a close relationship between a patient and an experienced prescriber,\" he said, citing the position reaffirmed by ASKP3.\nMyth No. 5: It\u2019s hard to kick the habit\n\"Weaning off ketamine is typically not too difficult, as the medicine has a half-life of three to four hours, and most is eliminated by the body in a single day,\" said Johnson.\n\"Ketamine should only be used within the confines of a close relationship between a patient and an experienced prescriber.\"\nGradual dose titrations of ketamine \u2014 in which the amounts are slowly increased or decreased \u2014 are recommended for starting and stopping the medication, the expert noted.\nWhen ketamine becomes dangerous\nKetamine can become dangerous in a few ways, according to experts.\n\"First, if a patient has access to use it at home for pain or mood, this can increase the likelihood of developing a physical or psychological dependence,\" Sullivan told Fox News Digital.\nExperts recommend that home use of ketamine is only prescribed for select patients \u2014 who should be closely monitored with regular face-to-face office visits.\n\"Another way it can become dangerous is if a patient uses too large of a dose in an unsupervised setting, where they may put themselves at risk for accidents, such as falls or drownings,\" said Sullivan.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nMixing ketamine with other medicines can also be dangerous, Johnson warned.\nFor example, when mixed with opiates, it can have a stronger sedative effect, and combining ketamine with stimulants can worsen cardiovascular effects, he said.\nIn particular, ketamine mixed with buprenorphine can enhance sedation and lead to unresponsiveness, said Johnson.\nBuprenorphine, a drug that is prescribed to treat opioid use disorder , was in Perry\u2019s system at the time of his death.\nGuidelines to be published soon\nASKP3 announced that it will soon publish guidelines for safe use of the drug.\n\"In the wake of Matthew Perry\u2019s autopsy report, we are committed to creating and publishing guidelines for at-home ketamine use, which should only be practiced with a very specific patient profile and only in the context of a close relationship with a physician and in-office follow-up,\" the organization said in a released statement.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt is important for people to recognize the distinction between different uses of the drug, according to Prashad.\n\"In reality, the ways in which ketamine is used for anesthesia versus depression versus abuse are all very different in terms of dosage and frequency.\"\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-12-19 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":390}
{"title":"Cavefish provide clues to the keto diet\u2019s effect on autism-like behavior","context":"## Cavefish provide clues to the keto diet\u2019s effect on autism-like behavior\n\nWhen thinking about treatments for conditions like autism spectrum disorder, diet is likely not high on the list. But clues from an eyeless species of cave-dwelling fish point to a link between a trendy weight loss diet, the brain, social behavior, and autism.\nThe ketogenic diet is designed to induce a physiological state called ketosis. This happens when the body no longer has enough carbohydrates to burn for energy and switches to fat as an energy source. Breaking down fat for energy produces a group of molecules called ketones, which travel throughout the body.\nHigh in protein and fat but low in carbs, the ketogenic diet is popular for its weight loss effects but also appears to have some neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects too. Children with epilepsy are sometimes placed on this diet because it helps reduce the frequency of seizures.\nThe exact mechanism behind these neurological effects is still a mystery and there have been reports of long-term side effects in people trying the diet outside of clinical settings. But experiments published in BMC Biology with the Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, may help reveal the link between diet and the brain.\nCavefish, an unexpected research model\nFor Masato Yoshizawa, geneticist and neuroscientist at the School of Life Sciences at The University of Hawai\u2018i M\u0101noa, the cavefish is a fascinating model system. While these fish have unique adaptions for the harsh, lightless living conditions of limestone caves in northern Mexico \u2014 such as the loss of their eyes \u2014 they also share several basic features with vertebrates, making experimental results with these fish applicable to other species. These features include the brain region involved in memory and emotion, as well as many genes and the signalling pathways used to control them.\nHumans and other vertebrates have more complexity in these systems, and experiments with the cavefish offer a way to strip it away to investigate fundamental questions of biology. While working with cavefish, Yoshizawa noticed similarities in their behavior and that of patients with autism. The fish avoid their peers and engage in repetitive behavior, such as swimming in circles.\n\u201cMany people first doubted that the fish have an autism-like state; I also doubted it at first,\u201d said Yoshizawa. But as he soon found out, even patterns of gene regulation resembled autistic patients.\nBelieving that cavefish might be useful for the study of autism, Yoshizawa approached his colleague Ryan Lee, a physician working with autism patients at Shriners Hospital for Children Honolulu. \u201cWhen I showed him the video of the cavefish he immediately said, \u2018yes, that is very similar to what I observe in my patients\u2019,\u201d recounted Yoshizawa.\nLee, who has experimented with ketogenic diets to improve autism symptoms with some success suggested they try it with the fish. In humans, not all patients receiving the ketogenic diet improve, but some do. If it worked with the fish, they might then be able to figure out how the diet effects behavior and improve the effectiveness of the treatment for humans.\nSurprisingly effective\nAgain, Yoshizawa was a bit skeptical. \u201cI doubted it at first,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to work, but it did.\u201d\nIn the experiment, cavefish where fed the same ketogenic milk provided to human patients, albeit with a few modifications for fish consumption, and their behavior was monitored. As a comparison, a type of A. mexicanus fish that lives in rivers and not caves were also tested.\nThe surface fish do not display the same autism like behaviors as their cave dwelling relatives. In the presence of other surface fish, individuals will begin to follow each other and swim together, something rarely seen in cavefish, Yoshizawa said. The surface fish also do not do the repetitive behavior of swimming in circles.\nUsing these fish as a comparison, Yoshizawa and his students watched and waited. Amazingly, after a month of the ketogenic diet, the cavefish began to act like the more social surface fish. They would follow each other in groups and ceased going round in circles. There were some other behaviors, such as attention to a specific task and sleeping, that were unaffected, but overall the results were promising and according to Yoshizawa, suggest dopamine could be key to how the diet affects behavior.\n\u201cWe suspect that due to this behavior variation, probably the target of the ketogenic diet is the dopaminergic system,\u201d he said. The challenge now is teasing out all the complex factors that may be involved.\nDiet, environment, and genes \u2013 a complex recipe\nAccording to Yoshizawa, there are two plausible ideas as to how the ketones produced by a ketogenic diet are acting on behavior. The first involves the mitochondria, which use either carbs or fat to produce energy in our cells, and the other involves epigenetics, which simple refers to any non-genetic influence which turns genes on and off.\nKetones are known to create detectable increases in gene expression in cells. Pulling apart exactly how things like, diet, environment, genes and neurotransmitters are linked is incredibly difficult but could reveal which pathways are best to target for autism treatments or could identify a specific ketone which works more efficiently than others.\nWhile the cavefish are not an exact model for human autism this work shows how these experiments shine light on the biology and evolution of these behavioral conditions and offer new directions for researchers to follow.\nReference: Motoko Iwashita, et al.

It's a powerful song.\"\n\u2018AMERICAN PIE\u2019 ICON DON MCLEAN ON AI: \u2018IT\u2019LL BE BETTER THAN WHAT PASSES ITSELF OFF AS MUSIC TODAY'\nThe Grammy-award honoree, Songwriters Hall of Fame member and BBC Lifetime Achievement Award recipient's \"Christmas Memories: Remixed & Remastered\" features McLean's take on other such Christmas classics and beloved holiday standards as \"Winter Wonderland,\" \"Let It Snow,\" \"The Burgundeon Carol,\" \"White Christmas,\" and more.\nHe said that after he and his band re-recorded and remixed \"Winter Wonderland,\" for instance, featuring bass player Jim Ferguson on the new version, he told the others, \"My God, this sounds like a whole different song.\"\nThe refreshed and upgraded songs felt so \"dynamic\" to him, he said, compelling him to want to get out the new album this holiday season.\nSpeaking of the Christmas season, McLean \u2014 born in New Rochelle, New York \u2014 said that \"the holidays are a time for families to come together. I remember as a kid sitting around the record player and listening to music with my family. We all had our favorites, which we played over and over again.\"\nDON MCLEAN OF \u2018AMERICAN PIE\u2019 FAME TELLS FOX NEWS DIGITAL, \u2018I DID THE RIGHT THING WITH MY LIFE\u2019\nHe said that \"all the greats from Bing Crosby to Gene Autry influenced me \u2014 so I've included my version of their classics on \u2018Christmas Memories: Remixed & Remastered.'\"\nMcLean is working all the time, he told Fox News Digital.\n\"American Boys,\" another new album of his, is coming out in February 2024 \u2014 and he's getting ready to tour again in the U.S.\nHis touring schedule in the year ahead may take him to the Far East, he suggested.\n\"As you may have remembered, the president of South Korea [Yoon Suk Yeol] sang \u2018American Pie\u2019 to our president in the White House this year \u2014 it was a big story, and he got a guitar signed by me,\" McLean said of the state dinner event held by the Biden White House on April 26.\nMcLean's recent tours over the past two years have celebrated the now 50-plus anniversary of \"American Pie,\" the 8\u00bd-minute folk-rock ballad and cultural touchstone about the loss of innocence among the early rock \u2018n\u2019 roll generation.\nMusic \"can help you. It can help you feel better \u2014 but we have to get over things. We have to get over stuff.\" \u2014 Don McLean to Fox News Digital\nAfter spending eight weeks on the charts, the song hit No. 1 on the Billboard chart on Jan. 15, 1972, noted the History Channel's website.\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, OCTOBER 2, 1945, \u2018AMERICAN PIE\u2019 SINGER-SONGWRITER DON MCLEAN IS BORN\n\"American Pie\" held the record for longest No. 1 song on the Billboard 100 for nearly half a century, until it was broken in Nov. 2021 when \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)\" by Taylor Swift hit No. 1 at a length of 10 minutes and 13 seconds.\n\"There is something to be said for a great song that has staying power,\" McLean told Billboard at the time.\nIn addition, a new children's book based on his song \"Vincent\" (\"Starry, Starry Night\") is in the pipeline and there's been a great deal of renewed interest in \"Vincent,\" his tribute to tortured artist Vincent van Gogh, he said.\n\"Vincent\" was the second single off his \"American Pie\" album. The song was a hit both in the U.S. and the U.K., landing at No. 1 on the singles chart in England.\nOn social media even in 2023, fans of the song continue to pour out personal feelings and insights about it \u2014 with some even saying they've broken down in tears upon hearing the song again after many years.\n\"I am here to tell you: [People] do feel things, but they don't have anybody out there who's giving them anything to feel.\"\nMcLean said, \"I want to share something on this point. Jack Nicholson, who is a very smart man, said something very important here. He said, 'I don't think the American public wants to be moved anymore.' He doesn't think people want to feel things. And I am here to tell you: They do feel things, but they don't have anybody out there who's giving them anything to feel.\"\nHe went on, \"It's all spectacle and empty. For example, we have a terribly, terribly empty political situation right now. I've never seen anything like it in my life. Everywhere you look, there's an empty suit. Nobody's got any brains. They don't know how to use the English language \u2014 it's pathetic.\"\nMcLean said that \"this is where music comes in. It can help you. It can help you feel better \u2014 but we have to get over things. We have to get over stuff. Like our grandparents and our parents did \u2014 they got over things. People are going to experience things, but they need to get over them.\"\nOf the enduring force and affect of music, McLean added, \"Think of 9\/11. Buildings were toppling over. New York City was closed down. Terrible. But you can't close music down. A song exists on a record, of course, but then it exists in the minds of millions of people. And so it's a monument, in a way. It's a very powerful thing.\"\n\"You can't close music down. A song exists on a record, of course, but then it exists in the minds of millions of people.\"\nAnd \"I realized when I was young guy that I didn't want to be a poet. I didn't want to be an actor or a playwright or any of those things. I wanted to write songs and sing songs. And so I think people cling to these things. That's why they're memorable.

{"title":"Seahawks-Cowboys Fantasy Start 'Em Sit 'Em Week 13: Should you start Zach Charbonnet, Jake Ferguson on TNF?","context":"## Seahawks-Cowboys Fantasy Start 'Em Sit 'Em Week 13: Should you start Zach Charbonnet, Jake Ferguson on TNF?\n\nWhen the Seahawks and Cowboys meet in Dallas on \"Thursday Night Football\" to open NFL Week 13 (8:15 p.m. ET, Amazon Prime Video), it will be a prime-time matchup featuring two potential playoff teams and plenty of key fantasy football start 'em, sit 'em question marks.\nWith a game total of 47.5 and the Cowboys favored by three field goals, it may be another rout for the home team against a weaker opponent. Dallas has some red-hot fantasy assets, while Seattle's struggling offensive skill players might be best suited for fantasy benches.\nHere's looking at who to start in seasonal leagues and DFS lineups from the latest edition of TNF:\nMORE THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | ATS pick | Best props\nSeahawks: Who to start, sit in fantasy football on TNF\nSit: QB Geno Smith\nSmith has dropped from the top 12 last season to cumulative QB20 in 2023. He's had two great starts and three so-so ones, but the rest has been forgettable. The Cowboys have allowed only two strong fantasy performances by quarterbacks, (Brock Purdy and Jalen Hurts), and we don't expect Smith to make it three.\nSit: RB Zach Charbonnet\nThere was a black fly in the Charbonnet against the 49ers last week. This is the good advice that you should take: Be wary of anyone who's rushed for just 47 yards two straight weeks despite getting significant duty with Kenneth Walker III (oblique) on the shelf. Charbonnet's also not doing much in the passing game, and this is as bad of a matchup as San Francisco was last week. You should do better, even in a big bye.\nWEEK 13 FANTASY ADVICE:\nSleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nStart: WR DK Metcalf\nMetcalf can flash big plays and stay involved in games...until he disappears when Smith can't get the ball to him. Smith might be judicious about throwing his way with second-year corner sensation DaRon Bland in coverage. That said, you simply can't sit DeKaylin Zacharius against anyone because of his big-game ability. Again, you can't expect more than WR3 production, which is where his overall scoring has been in 2023.\nStart: WR Tyler Lockett\nWhile Metcalf is WR34 in terms of total points this season in half-point PPR, Lockett is only two notches higher at WR32. They finished as WR13 and WR18, respectively, last season, so it's a big dropoff. Lockett also has a decent matchup vs. Stephon Gilmore. He, like Metcalf, remains a volume-based WR3.\nWEEK 13 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nSit: WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba\nSmith-Njigba can be a bit interesting if you are desperate in a deeper league because he has the matchup on par with the other two wideouts vs. Jourdan Lewis. JSN can mirror some of the production Curtis Samuel gave the Commanders last week in Dallas, but forget 100 yards. Around 50 yards seems like the ceiling with a big boost from garbage time.\nSit: TEs Noah Fant and Will Dissly\nNoah Gray is a better fantasy player than Noah Fant this season. Will Dissly is barely a better fantasy player than Will Mallory this season.\nWEEK 13 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nSit: Seahawks D\/ST\nThe Seahawks are getting better defensively against the pass, but that's not enough to trust them here, as they're getting gashed on the ground, too.\nSit: K Jason Myers\nThis is actually not a good spot for one of the most reliable fantasy kickers, given the Cowboys don't give up many field-goal attempts.\nWEEK 13 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best stacks | Best values\nCowboys: Who to start, sit in fantasy football on TNF\nStart: QB Dak Prescott\nGuess the only two quarterbacks who have been better than Rayne Dakota in fantasy this season? Yep, after his sizzling seven-game stretch, Prescott has ascended behind just Josh Allen and Jalen Hurts. The Seahawks haven't given up many big games to QBs, but you need to keep rolling with Dak on his heater, especially at home. One can't be surprised, however, if it's more of a 250-and-2 kind of night.\nStart: RB Tony Pollard | Sit: RB Rico Dowdle\nPollard and the Cowboys' defense is a reason why Prescott may not need to go nuts passing. The Seahawks have now joined the bottom five teams in giving up fantasy points to running backs. Pollard has come on the past two weeks against the Panthers and Commanders after sliding into RB2 range. Pollard scoots to something like 80 and a score. Dowdle is a stretch to get mop-up production, however,\nStart: WR CeeDee Lamb\nLamb can eat again in the slot against Jamal Adams, as he avoids the Seahawks' better cornerbacks on the outside. Again, don't expect a massive game because the running game, defense, and special teams will have plenty of success in another big victory.\nSit: WR Brandin Cooks\nCooks is the one Cowboy to fade this week vs. rookie Devon Witherspoon, who's quickly emerging as the Seahawks' best corner. The nature of the zone defense is to limit big plays. Plus, between Lamb, Pollard, the tight ends, and younger receivers, Cooks won't be needed much.\nStart: TE Jake Ferguson\nFerguson has slumped the past two weeks, catching a combined four-of-eight targets for 67 yards and no TDs against the Commanders and Panthers. He should be more active here working the middle of the field, as the Seahawks' TE defense is a bit inflated by the numbers. This is definitely set up to be more of a Ferguson game than a Cooks game.\nStart: Cowboys D\/ST\nThey are once again the top-scoring fantasy defense thanks to six massive outings, including the past two games. Dallas will get it done vs. Geno.\nStart: K Brandon Aubrey\nAubrey has been elite as a rookie with his field-goal production. He should be good for a couple of field goals to complement the Cowboys' touchdowns.\nSeahawks vs. Cowboys: DraftKings Showdown lineup\nCaptain (1.5X): Cowboys RB Tony Pollard $14,700\nFLEX: Cowboys QB Dak Prescott $11,000\nFLEX: Seahawks WR Tyler Lockett $7,200\nFLEX: Cowboys TE Jake Ferguson $6,200\nFLEX: Cowboys D\/ST $5,600\nFLEX: Seahawks WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba $5,200\nBased on the analysis, it's fine to invest plenty in the Cowboys' running and intermediate passing games. Pollard would be a good correlated stack with the Cowboys' defense. Here's hoping that Lockett and JSN will be the busiest Seahawks in second-half catchup mode.\nSeahawks vs. Cowboys: FanDuel single-game lineup\nMVP (1.5X): Cowboys RB Tony Pollard $14,500\nAnyFLEX: Cowboys QB Dak Prescott $17,500\nAnyFLEX: Seahawks WR Tyler Lockett $11,000\nAnyFLEX: Cowboys TE Jake Ferguson $9,000\nAnyFLEX: Seahawks WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba $8,000\nThis construction maxes out the salary on FD and is very similar to the DK philosophy of focusing on Pollard, this time not stacking with the defense.\n\nThis article, authored by Vinnie Iyer, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-30 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":394}
{"title":"VAR apology list in Premier League: Updated list of PGMOL apologies for referee mistakes in English football","context":"## VAR apology list in Premier League: Updated list of PGMOL apologies for referee mistakes in English football\n\nReferees once again took the headlines on the opening matchday of the 2023\/24 Premier League season following an incorrect VAR decision in Manchester United's fixture against Wolves.\nGary O'Neil's side were denied a late penalty after a foul from Andre Onana on Sasa Kalajdzic. Despite a long VAR check, Wolves were not given the spot-kick in injury time and lost the match 1-0.\nFans watching the game were in disbelief when the call was made, and similar incidents have happened since, including against United. Bruno Fernandes said he would wait for an apology \u2014 one that never arrived \u2014 after Cristian Romero was not punished for handball in the Red Devils' 2-0 loss to Tottenham, and plenty of onlookers debated the penalty won by Marcus Rashford in United's subsequent comeback win at home to Nottingham Forest.\nThe Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the body responsible for referees in English football, has apologised on multiple occasions for mistakes made during matches. Here is an updated list of the incidents.\nMORE: Kevin De Bruyne injury: How long Man City ace could be out\nEvery PGMOL apology for referee mistakes\nHere are all the apologies carried out by the PGMOL for wrong decisions later accepted to have been wrong.\nTottenham 2-1 Liverpool: September 30, 2023\nLiverpool had their hearts broken as Joel Matip's stoppage-time own-goal gave Tottenham a 2-1 victory. The Reds, down to nine men after a red card to Curtis Jones and two bookings for Diogo Jota, were looking to hang on at the death, and nearly did so until the cruel finish.\nHowever, the game could have turned out completely different had the VAR booth not committed a \"serious human error\" earlier in the match. Soon after Jones was sent off in the first half, Luis Diaz scored to put Liverpool 1-0 up despite their disadvantage, but the flag went up for offside. Replay seemed to show that Diaz was onside, but VAR Darren England ended his check without even drawing lines, and the decision stood.\nThe PGMOL issued a statement after the match stating the goal should have stood.\nManchester United 1-0 Wolves: August 14, 2023\nAfter Onana clattered into Kalajdzic in the box, O'Neil thought a penalty would certainly be awarded. Instead, the Wolves manager received a yellow card on the sidelines for his protests.\nPGMOL's Jonathan Moss did apologise for the mistake after the match, which O'Neil said he appreciated.\nTottenham 2-1 Brighton: April 8, 2023\nChief Refereeing Officer Howard Webb had to give to Brighton an apology after they were denied a penalty in their away trip to Tottenham. It was one of many decisions the Seagulls were not happy about.\nMitoma penalty... \u2753\nDunk penalty... \u2753\nMitoma handball... \u2753\nMac Allister handball... \u2753\n\nDermot Gallagher dissects Spurs vs Brighton \ud83d\udd0d pic.twitter.com\/hw86oA4frs \u2014 Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) April 10, 2023\nArsenal 1-1 Brentford: February 11, 2023\nArsenal were denied two points in their race for the title after VAR's Lee Mason did not use the right player when checking for an offside in Brentford's goal.\nMikel Arteta was not happy after the game. He said: \"That wasn't a human error. That was a big, big, big not conceiving and understanding your job.\"\nCrystal Palace 1-1 Brighton: February 11, 2023\nIncredibly, the referees made another wrong offside decision on the same day.\nJohn Brooks was taken off VAR duty for two games after he drew the offside line in the wrong place, denying Brighton's Pervis Estupinan a goal.\nAston Villa 3-1 Manchester United: November 6, 2022\nLucas Digne's free-kick was one of the highlights in Aston Villa's victory over Man United, but a post-match review showed he received additional help following a mistake from the referee.\nThe Red Devils' wall was set more than 10 yards behind the ball, allowing Digne more room to find the back of the net.\nNottingham Forest 2-2 Brentford: November 5, 2022\nBrentford were awarded a penalty after a collision between Dean Henderson and Yoane Wissa. Replays showed that Wissa initiated the contact, but Brentford were still given the spot-kick.\nThis forced Webb to apologise to Forest after the match.\nFulham 3-0 Aston Villa: October 20, 2022\nDouglas Luiz was wrongly sent off for Aston Villa just after the hour mark. He was thought to have instigated a bust-up, when the real perpetrator was in fact Aleksandar Mitrovic.\nManchester United 3-1 Arsenal: September 4, 2022\nArsenal's first defeat of the season came at Old Trafford, but a refereeing decision impacted the match early on.\nGabriel Martinelli was denied a goal after a VAR check decided Martin Odegaard had fouled Christian Eriksen. PGMOL later revealed that the goal should have stood.\nMORE: Mason Greenwood to leave Man United: What will happen next\nNewcastle 0-0 Crystal Palace: September 3, 2022\nCrystal Palace were let off the hook when Tyrick Mitchell's own goal was ruled out after Joe Willock was thought to have impeded Vicente Guaita between the sticks.\nIt turned out to be the wrong decision, despite a lengthy check in the VAR hub.\nChelsea 2-1 West Ham: September 3, 2022\nMaxwell Cornet thought he scored late on against Chelsea to make it 2-2, but the referee disallowed the goal due to a foul on Edouard Mendy by Jarrod Bowen in the build-up.\nWebb apologised to David Moyes after the incident.\nCrystal Palace 3-1 Aston Villa: August 20, 2022\nWebb's first apology in his new role came during Villa's defeat at Selhurst Park. Andy Madley awarded Palace a penalty following a check on the VAR monitor.\nThe decision, which went against Digne, was the wrong call.\nEverton 0-1 Manchester City: February 26, 2022\nMan City were given a helping hand in their title race against Liverpool after Everton were denied a penalty in the second half.\nRodri misjudged the flight of the ball and it ricocheted off his arm. VAR official Chris Kavanagh stuck with the on-field decision, which later forced referees chief Mike Riley to apologise to Everton.\n\nThis article, authored by Joel Sritharan, was published by Sporting News on 2023-09-30 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":395}
{"title":"X (formerly Twitter) is worst for disinformation, per EU analysis","context":"## X (formerly Twitter) is worst for disinformation, per EU analysis\n\nX (formerly Twitter) has been called out in the European Union for having the worst ratio of disinformation\/misinformation to posts not spreading falsehoods among mainstream social networks.\nIn a speech today discussing the latest updates from other platforms that have signed up to combat disinformation under a beefed up EU Code of Practice that\u2019s been linked to compliance with the the bloc\u2019s legally binding Digital Services Act (DSA), it commissioner for values and transparency, Vera Jourova, said X\u2019s poor performance was assessed during a pilot phase of testing of new methodology developed by Code signatories.\n\u201cA big novelty under the Code is now the publication of the first set of structural indicators such as how easy it is to find disinformation content, how much engagement such content receives or indicators about sources. These indicators \u2014 developed by the signatories \u2014 constitute an unprecedented and novel insight into disinformation on online platforms,\u201d she suggested. \u201cSuch insight is crucial to understand how effective platforms efforts are to fight this threat even more efficiently.

X, former Twitter, who is not under the Code any more is the platform with the largest ratio of mis\/disinformation posts.\u201d\nThe Elon Musk-owned platform exited the EU\u2019s Code of Practice on Disinformation back in May, shortly after EU lawmakers warned that policy shifts executed after Musk\u2019s takeover were boosting Kremlin propaganda and criticised the company for patchy reporting. The EU\u2019s top diplomat also took a public shot at Twitter for ending free access to its APIs for researchers, saying the action could threaten the study of disinformation.\nLast year the Commission also warned Musk over \u201chuge work\u201d ahead if the platform was to avoid falling foul of the incoming DSA.\nUnder Musk, X has pushed the use of an existing crowdsourced fact-checking feature (rebranded as Community Notes) which essentially seeks to outsource the issue to a hands-length process of aggregating views from platform users, some of which may be appended as contextual notes to dubious tweets. At the same time the erratic billionaire has set about removing signals Twitter users were previously able to rely on to help assess the quality of information tweets contained, such as removing state-affiliated media labels from propaganda outlets and replacing legacy account verifications with pay-to-play.\nX was contacted for a response to the EU\u2019s analysis of the ratio of disinformation it\u2019s spreading. It replied with an automated email reading: \u201cBusy now, please check back later.\u201d\nUpdate: X\u2019s global government affairs account has posted a thread responding to the EU\u2019s criticism in which it claims the data shows other social networking services saw greater changes in subscriber growth and total growth for pro-Kremlin accounts, and for engagement and volume; it also writes that: \u201cMore than 700 unique Community Notes have appeared on posts related to the Ukraine conflict. Through Community Notes\u2019 new \u2018Notes on Media\u2019 feature, which automatically matches notes on an image or video to other posts that contain matching media, these notes appeared on over 1,200 additional posts. These notes are in numerous languages and are written specifically for local audiences.\u201d\nBack in April, X\/Twitter was named as one of 19 larger platforms that face the strictest level of regulation under the EU\u2019s DSA. The law puts an obligation on so-called very large online platforms (VLOPs) to assess societal risks attached to their use of algorithms \u2014 and put in place \u201creasonable, proportionate and effective mitigation measures\u201d for identified risks, with their reporting and mitigation plans subject to independent audit and oversight by the Commission.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to the Commission with questions about how it plans to respond to this latest analysis of X\u2019s role in spreading disinformation.\nUpdate: A Commission spokesperson told us:\nWhile the Code is voluntary, compliance with the DSA is not. The DSA is now legally binding on X\/Twitter. This includes in particular the obligation of Very Large Online Platforms, such as X\/Twitter to mitigate the risks their platforms pose for the spread of disinformation. The TrustLab study to measure two Structural Indicators covers signatories of the Code at the time of the launch of the exercise, which at the time included X\/Twitter. During this period the DSA had not entered into force yet for VLOPs and VLOSEs, including X\/Twitter. The Commission cannot comment further on the substance of the risk assessments. We are analysing the available information on a range of issues and we are in close contact with X but we cannot comment on specifics and timelines. As stated by Commissioner [Thierry] Breton, minor protection and integrity of elections are priorities in the enforcement of the DSA.\nPenalties for breaches of the DSA can scale up to 6% of global annual turnover and the Commission has previously wanted that not following the Code of Practice on Disinformation would be factored into its assessments. So the price for X ignoring the EU\u2019s warnings on disinformation could be steep \u2014 albeit its ad revenue has cratered since Musk\u2019s takeover, as a result of his failure to tackle toxicity and harmful disinformation encouraging an advertiser exodus \u2014 and shrinking earnings would effectively downsize any future penalties X could face under the DSA.\nSubscription revenues to a revamped Twitter Blue paid offering (now called X Premium) don\u2019t appear to have been substantial enough to plug the ad gap \u2014 which may explain Musk\u2019s recent suggestion he plans to charge all users a small fee. However ending free access to X could be the final nail in the coffin of the platform as a real-time information network if it triggers a further\/final exodus of remaining legacy users whose knowledge and engagement lent Twitter its original value.\nDisinformation and spammers may rush in to fill the gap, generating a parody of activity, but without a critical mass of genuine users to pay attention and contribute value and vitality \u2014 aka the life-blood of a bona fide information network \u2014 X really will mark the spot of Twitter\u2019s demise.\nAlso today, a report by misinformation watcher NewsGuard found that a decision by Musk to remove labels denoting state-run or government-affiliated media accounts led to a surge in propaganda spreading on X, with Russia\u2019s RT seeing the biggest gains per the analysis.\nFrom the report:\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-09-26 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":396}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nWe\u2019ve all been there. A friend\u2019s wedding is three days away and you don\u2019t have anything to wear. The last thing you want to do is drag yourself around high-street shops, so inevitably you turn to ASOS. After all, the company is known for its next day delivery and easy returns service.\nThough many of us are reliant on the online fast fashion retailer for last-minute holiday purchases or big seasonal shops, a new report shows that ASOS\u2019s pre-tax losses ballooned to almost \u00a3300m in the year to 3 September, compared with \u00a331m the previous year, according to the results published on Wednesday (1 November).\nDespite its huge popularity, the once undisputed queen of online retailers now faces stiff competition from abroad, challenging economic headwinds, and a maturing clientele potentially seeking a more tailored experience. Leading some to ask, is ASOS in SOS?\nWhen ASOS was launched in 2000, the online retailer was considered revolutionary. It was like a supersize department store at your fingertips and became the first online retailer that UK customers could visit and find hundreds of dresses for \u00a330 all in one place.\nBut, in recent years, the company has been cutting its stock as it faces severe profit and revenue losses. In July and August, the retailer said it was hit by wet during the summer months, forcing the retailer to cut its stock by 30 per cent.\nSome experts now say that the holes within ASOS\u2019s business model are becoming apparent. Rick Smith, Managing Director of business recovery firm Forbes Burton tells The Independent that ASOS\u2019s business model of allowing large numbers of free returns makes the company susceptible to financial losses during challenging economic conditions.\n\u201cThe buying culture within their target demographic sees several items returned for each order placed, which can make for slim profit margins,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cASOS has enjoyed a stratospheric rise since their inception, but have perhaps reached their ceiling now and need to cut their cloth accordingly, especially given the amount of economic headwinds [such as as the cost of living crisis] in play at the moment.\u201d\nThe buying habits of consumers have also shifted in the 23 years since ASOS launched. Smith says that sifting through hundreds of products has become a painstaking and often unenjoyable task for its customers.\n\u201cOnce large online retailers get to a certain size, it can become laborious for customers to scour their whole catalogue,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cThe online fashion landscape is evolving now to a point that customers are looking for a more tailored service from websites.\u201d\nWith the rise of shopping on social media, too, young people are increasingly buying individual items from retailers on Instagram and TikTok or instead shopping directly from the brands that ASOS stocks, such as Pull and Bear, St\u00fcssy and Bershka, which all have their own websites.\nASOS distribution centre near Barnsley, South Yorkshire. (PA)\n\u201cASOS\u2019s busy 20-something [target] market doesn\u2019t necessarily have the time to sift through dozens of item pages,\u201d adds Smith. \u201cSo curated collections and recommendations based on user input may be one of the changes they eventually look at.\u201d\nASOS, which originally stood for As Seen On Screen, initially started trading with the tagline \u201cBuy what you see on film and TV\u201d as it exclusively sold imitations of clothing worn by celebrities. That business model quickly expanded away from the world of replica products: ASOS now offers 850 affordable to mid-range high-street brands and ships to 196 countries.\nBut the company is also now tackling a debt issue, with net debt including leases now at \u00a3648.5m, up from \u00a3533m the year before. Analysts predict that the online fashion site may need to raise quick cash soon \u2013 potentially through the rumoured sale of its Topshop brand, which ASOS acquired when the Arcadia Group went bust in 2021 and closed Topshop\u2019s bricks and mortar stores.\nDespite the profit slump and predicted future losses, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ramos Calamonte, ASOS\u2019s chief executive, said in the report that the company has made \u201cgood progress\u201d in \u201ca very challenging environment\u201d and would continue to invest in its brand and stock more fashionable lines of clothing.\nThe company plans to spend \u00a330m more on marketing and said it was going \u201cback to fashion\u201d with its products \u201cgeared around fashion and excitement\u201d.\nAs ASOS faces huge losses, it was reported this week that the Chinese-founded retailer Shein has acquired UK company Missguided, with plans to \u201creignite\u201d the online retailer that was only bought out of administration by Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group a year and a half ago.\nDespite calls for boycotts from anti-fashion campaigners, Shein is currently valued at around \u00a353bn, having expanded globally and bought many of its rival brands. In 2022, it was the most-googled fashion brand in the world and made a reported \u00a318.9bn in revenue, suggesting that fast fashion is not falling out of favour with consumers who want to find entire outfits on a budget.\n\nThis article, authored by Ellie Muir, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-11-01 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":397}
{"title":"European neobroker Scalable Capital raises $65M on a flat $1.4B valuation","context":"## European neobroker Scalable Capital raises $65M on a flat $1.4B valuation\n\nScalable Capital, a Munich startup that aims to make investing in financial markets accessible to a wider range of consumers, is putting more fuel in its tank to drive deeper into Europe. The company has raised \u20ac60 million in equity ($65 million at today\u2019s rates). It will be using the funds to build out its business in the six countries \u2014 Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Spain and Netherlands \u2014 where it is already active and to expand into more. Balderton is leading the round, with participation from HV Capital out of its new growth fund and other unnamed existing backers.\nContrary to the startup\u2019s name, this round is coming in at a flat valuation of $1.4 billion. This was the same valuation Scalable Capital had the last time it raised money \u2014 $180 million in 2021, a round led by Tencent, with BlackRock, HV and Tengelmann participating. That is despite the fact that the startup is now \u201cfour or five times bigger\u201d than it was two years ago, according to co-CEO Erik Podzuweit, who co-founded the company with Florian Prucker.\nToday, Scalable Capital, which started as a digital wealth management platform, now describes itself as a full-service brokerage. It has 1.2 million savings plans on the platform, which it tells me works out to over 600,000 customers, and close to \u20ac17 billion under management, with products covering ETFs, stocks, funds, bonds, cryptocurrencies and derivatives, and loans. It gives users access to investing in 8,000 stocks, 2,500 ETFs and 3,500 funds among other products; ETFs are the most popular today.\nThat speaks a lot to the ongoing pressure on startups amid a very tight market for finance at the moment in the region. (More on that theme in the latest annual, barometric report from Atomico.)\n\u201cYes, we are four or five times bigger than we were at the last round,\u201d Podzuweit said in an interview. \u201cSo like for like, obviously it\u2019s a very attractive deal for the investor. But in the current market environment, I think it\u2019s really cool that we managed to get to pull this off.\u201d He confirmed that the company still has \u201cthe majority of the money from the last funding round\u201d in the bank, but this extra injection means it can be a little more aggressive in its approach. \u201cWe can do a bit more marketing, we can hire the top people but we also have a much bigger equity cushion,\u201d he said. The company has now raised more than $345 million, it said.\nIndeed, the fundraise may be coming at a tight time for startup finance, but one likely reason that Scalable took the money now is that, for neobrokers, the landscape is getting more competitive and crowded.\nLate last month, Robinhood \u2014 the tech company best known for democratizing investing in the U.S. \u2014 finally took its first step into international (and European) territories, opening an office in the U.K. (and just today launching crypto trading in the EU on the back of that). Other players out of the U.K. market with clear European ambitions include Freetrade and Lightyear.\nAnd just yesterday, Scalable Capital\u2019s biggest rival among startups, Trade Republic, secured a full banking license from the European Central Bank. The latter, backed by Sequoia among others and last valued at $5.3 billion back in June 2022 (via PitchBook), said it will use the new license to launch more savings and investment products \u2014 a move that will lay the gauntlet down for Scalable to figure out if, and how, it will level up.\nFor now, Scalable Capital is holding steady and not pursuing a license itself, said Podzuweit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s leaner, obviously,\u201d he said, likening it to how some e-commerce companies might invest in building out their own logistics, and some work with third parties (Scalable\u2019s banking partners, in lieu of a license, include ING). \u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t rule [getting a license] out forever. But right now we\u2019re focusing on building products and launching new markets and we are faster doing it our way.\u201d\nThe other big forces that are playing in the market include the looming presence of AI and how it will be used both to manage investing platforms, but also investments themselves; and the general state of the economy: Generally, markets have been in the doldrums, with inflation, and unfavorable interest rates bringing a chilling effect to consumers\u2019 inclination to take risks and invest money that could be used more immediately elsewhere.\nScalable\u2019s positioning, as it is with others like it, is that it leaves the door open for smaller and more incremental buy-ins from its customers. On top of this, Podzuweit points out that the startup\u2019s average user age is 35, a person perhaps with more disposable income than some of the younger consumers that other neobrokers have courted.\nThe focus on ramping up at a time when the market looks like it has cooled is also very much in line with the ethos of investing, where people often put down their money at lower points if they believe that it will represent a great deal in the longer run. Of course, only time will tell whether that firm belief in growth longer term will play out as hoped.\nBalderton general partner Rana Yared is joining the board with this round. \u201cScalable\u2019s one-stop, digital-first, wealth building and generating platform brings a suite of top-class financial products to individuals across Europe, and is unparalleled in the market,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve been impressed by Erik, Florian and team\u2019s vision and execution to date and are delighted to be supporting them in this next chapter.\u201d We\u2019re hopefully hearing from Yared directly later today and will update this more after that.\nUpdated to correct the amount raised in 2021 to $180 million, not $140 million; and to specify the number of customers and the total raised, after the numbers were provided by the company post-publication.\n\nThis article, authored by Ingrid Lunden, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-07 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":398}
{"title":"How to wake Art Cullagh and lift the Shadow Curse in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3","context":"## How to wake Art Cullagh and lift the Shadow Curse in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\n\nArt Cullagh is a sleepy man in the Last Light Inn of Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\u2019s second act, and he\u2019s the key to breaking the Shadow Curse that plagues the Shadow-touched lands.\nOnce you make it into act 2 and reach the central hub of the Last Light Inn, you\u2019ll be able to wake up Art, locate Thaniel, defeat Oliver, and finally recruit Halsin as a real companion for your party. All of that takes place during a lengthy quest that will take you all across these new lands and to the edge of Moonrise Towers.\nIn this Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 guide, we\u2019ll walk you through how to wake up Art Cullagh and how to break the Shadow Curse in act 2.\nWake up Art Cullagh\nOnce you reach the Last Light Inn in the Shadow-cursed Lands, head back to your camp and talk to Halsin. He\u2019ll tell you the tale of a young man named Thaniel, a Tiefling who is the root of the curse that\u2019s taking over the Shadow-cursed Land.\nNow head back to the Last Light Inn and visit the bunks on the first floor, just to the right of the entrance. There\u2019ll be a man named Art Cullagh lying in bed with a swirly animation above him. Talk to him and he\u2019ll mutter something about Thaniel. Walk through the dialogue and you\u2019ll learn that he needs some kind of personal item to wake him.\nReturn to Halsin in camp, and the Druid will decide he needs to see the sleeping man himself. Jump back to the Last Light Inn and talk to Art again, this time with Halsin\u2019s help. Read Art\u2019s last orders letter and a quest marker near Moonrise Towers will appear. Make your way there.\nIn the town, near the Road to Baldur\u2019s Gate Waypoint, you\u2019ll find the House of Healing and the cemetery it\u2019s connected to \u2014 not exactly a good pairing if you want people to have faith in your hospital. Inside you\u2019ll be directed to the operating theater and the \u201cdoctor\u201d on staff.\nMake your way into the large room at the back of the hospital and you\u2019ll meet Malus Thorm and his crew of assistants. Thorm is an undead boss who is also a \u201csurgeon\u201d torturing a patient. Talk to him enough and you\u2019ll end up in some combat. Kill Thorm and his cronies and then loot his body once combat is over. He\u2019ll have a Battered Lute on his person. Take it and return to Art back in Last Light.\nLocate and rescue Thaniel\nWith the Battered Lute in hand, walk up to Art and accept the prompt to play him a song. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not proficient in an instrument, your character will just dopily pluck away at the strings until Art wakes up.\nAfter Halsin talks to Art, he\u2019ll decide that he needs to peer into another dimension to rescue Thaniel. Follow him to the shore and get ready for a fight. Let Halsin go into the portal on his own and prepare to defend it. A massive army of undead creatures will appear on the shore and start trying to reach the portal.\nYou\u2019ll need to hold them off for multiple rounds of combat in order to progress the quest. We recommend Shadowheart here, as she\u2019s able to use Turn Undead against all of the creatures. Gale is also an excellent choice, as his large AoE abilities like Fireball can take out many of the low health critters at once.\nOnce you\u2019ve successfully defended the portal for the required time, all of the undead will burn up and Halsin will return from the portal carrying Thaniel\u2019s body. The Druid will ask you to come back to camp and talk. Meet him there and he\u2019ll finally offer to join your crew to finish rescuing Thaniel.\nFinish Thaniel\u2019s quest to lift the curse\nJust because you have Halsin in your crew doesn\u2019t mean you can relax, or that the Druid doesn\u2019t have more work for you to do.\nIn order to remove the curse, you\u2019ll need to find Thaniel\u2019s other half: Oliver, an obnoxious boy who likes playing hide and seek in the middle of the cursed lands. You can find his little house to the east of Last Light in an area called \u201cHouse in Deep Shadows\u201d on the map.\nWhen you find him, Oliver will ask to play hide-and-seek. Oblige him and look around until you perceive his location. He\u2019ll get mad and try another game where he hides again and summons some wraiths to chase you.\nNow you can either sneak around and carefully try to catch him again, or you can get caught and just kill the shades. Either way, talk to Oliver again and he won\u2019t want to play with you, because he\u2019s a jerk. Assuming you\u2019ve already rescued Thaniel, you can tell Oliver that he needs to rejoin his other half. This will eventually lead to another minor combat encounter.\nOliver will teleport you to the Moonrise Towers town square, alongside resurrected versions of his Mommy and Daddy Shades. Oliver will encase himself in a shield and sic his undead minions on you. Each time you kill one of his enemies, Oliver\u2019s shield will also take damage. You can also directly target the shield with attacks. Break the shield one way or the other to talk to Oliver again. Persuade or threaten him and he\u2019ll decide to rejoin with Thaniel.\nHead back to camp again and talk to the now-complete boy. Unfortunately, Thaniel alone won\u2019t be able to end the curse on the lands. Instead you\u2019ll need to finish the mainline quest in Moonrise Towers. But at least Thaniel is whole again \u2014 and, more importantly, you have a brand new Druid friend to keep you company on your adventures.\n\nThis article, authored by Ryan Gilliam, was published by Polygon on 2023-12-19 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":399}
{"title":"The Soccer Star on the Verge of Breaking an 89-Year-Old Record","context":"## The Soccer Star on the Verge of Breaking an 89-Year-Old Record\n\nErling Haaland is just six away from Norway\u2019s goalscoring record, so it is surely inevitable that he will soon be his nation\u2019s most prolific striker ever.\nOn one hand, that will have happened remarkably quickly \u2013 Haaland only scored his first goals for Norway in 2020. On the other, this has been an incredibly long time coming.\nGO DEEPER What is Haaland really like?\nOf the 213 FIFA-affiliated nations, Norway\u2019s is the longest-standing outright individual goalscoring record in the world. It was set by Jorgen Juve, a fascinating figure who ended his international career in 1937 and later became a renowned sports journalist in his home country.\nAdvertisement\nJuve scored a relatively modest 33 goals in 45 matches for Norway, including five hat-tricks, although his tally is made remarkable by the fact he played as a centre-forward in less than half of those games. He was otherwise positioned in defence, from where he captained his nation to the bronze medal at the 1936 Olympics. That explains why his final international goal came three years before his final cap, in June 1934. Therefore, it is likely that by the time Haaland scores six more goals, it will be around 90 years since Juve reached the 33-goal mark.\nThere is technically one other record that stands for longer, also in Scandinavia.\nPoul \u201cTist\u201d Nielsen scored 52 goals in 38 games for Denmark between 1910 and 1925, although his record was equalled by Jon Dahl Tomasson \u2014 now manager of Blackburn Rovers in the English Championship \u2014 in 2010. Tomasson elected to retire from international football after that year\u2019s World Cup in South Africa rather than seeking to make the record his own. Nielsen\u2019s name therefore remains in the record books, although he now holds Denmark\u2019s record only jointly.\nThis graph demonstrates the extent to which these records are outliers.\nOnly six countries\u2019 goalscoring records have stood for more than 50 years, including Libya, Sudan and Guinea. Therefore, if we only include nations to have qualified for the World Cup, it is only Denmark, Norway and Hungary whose records have lasted more than half a century.\nHungary\u2019s record is perhaps the most impressive, considering Ferenc Puskas scored 84 goals in just 85 games, and his international career was brought to a premature end at the age of 29 because of the Hungarian Revolution. He later represented Spain at the 1962 World Cup, having gone half a decade without playing international football.\nFerenc Puskas (right) playing for Hungary against England at Wembley in 1953 (Barratts\/PA Images via Getty Images)\nThe most striking thing about the graph is how many goalscoring records have been set recently.\nAdvertisement\nSixty-four of the 211 nations\u2019 record goalscorers have appeared for them in 2023, and in terms of time since they were set, the median goalscoring mark has stood for just seven years, which includes the likes of the Republic of Ireland\u2019s Robbie Keane and Paraguay\u2019s Roque Santa Cruz. Increased longevity due to superior fitness levels in the modern game is clearly a major factor, as is the number of relatively new nations on the FIFA list.\nPerhaps the most surprising international goalscoring record is that of Italy.\nGiga Riva\u2019s relatively insubstantial haul of 35 goals has been the mark to beat since World Cup 1974. Not only has it not been matched or eclipsed, but no one has ever got particularly near it \u2014 Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero both reached 27 and that\u2019s as close as anyone has come.\nFor context, four Englishmen have reached 35 goals in that period \u2014 Gary Lineker, Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane. Four Spaniards too \u2014 Raul Gonzalez, Fernando Torres, David Villa and David Silva, while Alvaro Morata (on 34) should get there shortly.\nFurthermore, no current Italians seem set to challenge it \u2014 Ciro Immobile (with 17) has less than half that tally, turns 34 years old in February, and has been omitted from recent squads. Nobody in Luciano Spalletti\u2019s current squad has scored more than eight international goals.\nItaly\u2019s shortcoming clearly isn\u2019t about a complete lack of prolific strikers \u2014 the likes of Christian Vieri, Pippo Inzaghi and Luca Toni all scored heavily at club level. Sometimes it\u2019s been the opposite, with various strikers competing for a starting place, meaning none of them got to dominate the national side for a decade. That said, around a decade ago, there was simply a dearth of prolific Italian strikers to choose from. Antonio Conte used Eder and Graziano Pelle up front at the 2016 European Championship.\nAdvertisement\nThere are also tactical considerations. Not only have Italy traditionally been the most defensive of the major European nations, but their attacking play has generally been based around using a second striker. Baggio, Del Piero and Francesco Totti have all been the golden boy at various \u2014 overlapping \u2014 stages, with Italy\u2019s No 9 often selected primarily to bring the best out of Italy\u2019s No 10.\nWhat of Norway? They, similarly, were traditionally a defensive-minded side, favouring counter-attacks and long balls. At their peak under Egil Olsen in the mid-1990s, they often used a striker out of position on the wing, where he would challenge for long, diagonal balls.\nNorway\u2019s Jostein Flo, a giant striker often utilised on the right flank, at the 1994 World Cup (Chris Cole\/Allsport)\nBut perhaps the more pertinent thing about Norway is that, historically, they generally haven\u2019t been very competitive.\nThey\u2019ve only ever qualified for four major tournaments \u2014 in 1938, 1994, 1998 and 2000 \u2014 and have won a combined three matches in those appearances. They\u2019re also similar to Italy in that, at times, they\u2019ve boasted various high-level strikers whose careers roughly overlapped \u2014 John Carew, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Tore Andre Flo, Steffen Iversen \u2014 and at other points have suffered a complete lack of good centre-forwards.\nAt this point in time, Norway appear to have the most prolific striker in Europe, and it\u2019s not unreasonable to consider where Haaland might end up in the all-time international goalscoring charts worldwide, never mind just in relation to his compatriots.\nHaaland is currently averaging nearly a goal a game for his country, which will inevitably be difficult for the 23-year-old to sustain over his career. But it\u2019s worth pointing out how impressive that is, even at this early stage. Again, excluding countries who have never qualified for a World Cup, only the aforementioned quartet of Juve, Riva, Puskas and Nielsen, plus Japan\u2019s Kunishige Kamamoto, hold their nation\u2019s international goalscoring records and also boast a rate of 0.75 goals per game or more.\nEven Cristiano Ronaldo, the most prolific international goalscorer of all time with 127 for Portugal, boasts \u2018only\u2019 0.63 goals per game, a lower rate than the likes of Romelu Lukaku (Belgium), Kane and Aleksandar Mitrovic (Serbia), which owes to his early days as a winger rather than a central striker.\nKane and Ronaldo, two national-team record scorers still operating in 2023 (Burak Akbulut\/Anadolu Agency\/Getty Images)\nConsidering how many hat-tricks Haaland scores for Manchester City, it\u2019s not beyond the realms of possibility that he could score six goals during this international break to move level with Juve, particularly given Norway\u2019s first fixture is a home friendly against the Faroe Islands today (Thursday), before a European Championship qualifier against Scotland in Glasgow on Sunday. That said, the Faroes\u2019 defence is less leaky than you might expect \u2014 only twice in their last 22 outings have they conceded more than three times in a game.\nAdvertisement\nThe wider question is whether we will ever see Haaland at a major tournament.\nDespite the presence of him and Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard, Norway have failed to qualify from their Euro 2024 qualification group directly, with Spain and Scotland already securing the top two spots.\nThey are, at least, likely to qualify for the play-offs, and therefore will have two must-win games in March to secure their first major tournament appearance since 2000 \u2014 the summer when Haaland was born. But there\u2019s been little in recent performances to think Norway will breeze through those play-offs.\nJuve\u2019s individual record will soon be surpassed, but captaining his side to a bronze medal at the Olympics may stand as his nation\u2019s greatest achievement for much longer.\nGO DEEPER Erling Haaland is phenomenal - so why hasn\u2019t he made Manchester City better?\n(Top photo: Sebastian Widmann \u2013 UEFA\/UEFA via Getty Images)\n\nThis article, authored by The New York Times, was published by The New York Times on 2023-11-17 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":400}
{"title":"Twitch\u2019s money guy talks about the revenue split controversy and its monetization long game","context":"## Twitch\u2019s money guy talks about the revenue split controversy and its monetization long game\n\nTwitch has had a tense year, in part due to community backlash over policy changes that affect the way creators can monetize their content.\nLast year, the company announced that it would end the 70\/30 subscription revenue split deal that it had offered select streamers in favor of prioritizing ad revenue. In June, Twitch launched the Partner Plus program, a new monetization tier that would grant eligible creators a 70\/30 subscription revenue split on the first $100,000 they make per year. The program further strained its relationship with its community, because the requirements to qualify excluded the vast majority of streamers. Streamers need at least 350 monthly paid subscriptions, and gift subs and monthly subs that come with an Amazon Prime account don\u2019t count.\nIn response, Twitch pivoted eligibility to a points-based system, assigning a value to each subscription tier. The higher-priced subscriptions now count more toward the point total.\n\ud83d\udce3 We\u2019re updating how we calculate progress toward the Partner Plus program. To recognize deeper support from your community, Tier 1, 2, and 3 subs will earn you 1, 2, and 6 points respectively towards qualifying for the program. pic.twitter.com\/HdOiLvg3qC \u2014 Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) August 28, 2023\nTwitch also walked back its policy restricting embedded ads and other sponsored content, following fallout from streamers who depend on branded content as the bulk of their income.\nThe company\u2019s CEO Dan Clancy, who took over earlier this year, has prioritized engaging with Twitch streamers, and involving their perspectives in policy changes going forward. The company\u2019s receptiveness to community feedback has marginally lessened animosity from its streamers, and community sentiment toward Twitch at this year\u2019s TwitchCon in Las Vegas was significantly more positive than it was last year. New features and policy changes announced during the convention\u2019s keynote address, including granting streamers more control over ad breaks and allowing simulcasting to other livestreaming platforms, also appeased the Twitch community.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Twitch\u2019s Chief Monetization Officer Mike Minton discussed the unpopular policy decisions, supporting smaller creators through branded partnerships and what Twitch is doing to mend its relationship with its community.\nTechCrunch: I\u2019m going to start with a maybe unpleasant question, but Twitch has made some unpopular decisions in terms of monetization. Is there anything that Twitch is doing to appease irate creators?\nMike Minton: Two years ago, we said we\u2019re no longer gonna do these deals that weren\u2019t objective in terms of eligibility criteria. We ended that program. It affected a relatively small number of creators, but what it really impacted was the community going, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to work for.\u201d And that led to us recently announcing Partner Plus. There was some feedback saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to need a lot of subs,\u201d and we reacted to it by making it eligible by sub points so that your higher price point subscriptions cost more, and that was actually received quite positively.\nBoth Dan and I have said in different forms, that this is the beginning. It\u2019s not the end and we\u2019re going to continue to work to provide access to higher rev shares as we can over time, to more streamers.\nWhat would that look like?\nThe simple answer is now, 350 was the criteria we established, right? And that number is arbitrary and could easily come down. Now, our target and our goal in this program still remains the same. We\u2019re looking to benefit the creators, where livestreaming is a meaningful part of what they\u2019re doing as a creator. That allows us to focus on those streamers that are really at a point where it will matter most for them in terms of keeping them as a livestreaming creator.\nRight, and that decision to change the revenue split also came out of a decision to prioritize ad revenue. Creators and viewers have said that integrating ads in their streams is very frustrating. What kind of feedback is Twitch going to provide in response to that?\nLet\u2019s level set a couple things. So one of the things we knew with ads, if we\u2019re going to get streamers to buy into ads as a good way to monetize, is that we had to increase the rev share, which we did, and launch the ad incentive program.\nWe\u2019re helping streamers understand that with ad running, you have to think about it consistently over time in order to earn predictable revenue. It\u2019s a very reliable source of income for many streamers.\nSo I think the combination of making it easier to run, increasing the rev share and then recently in the keynote, we talked about two new features to allow moderators to know when an ad break is coming, and adjust the ad break around the content because the problem in livestreaming, as you\u2019re aware, is that people don\u2019t want to miss out. So we\u2019re very focused on improving the ad experience by allowing the ad breaks to be synchronized with the content and enrolling moderations and eventually the community in adjusting those ad breaks.\nLike you said, livestreaming is very different from static content, and tactics for monetization that work for Instagram or TikTok just don\u2019t really work for Twitch or any livestreaming platform. In those cases, what has Twitch done differently from those more standard platforms in terms of making monetization more seamless?\nOne thing we\u2019ve done since the beginning, where we are a leader, is getting people to take their wallets out and support creators through subscriptions, gifting, cheering. I think that sets us as a unique community-based platform where viewers are directly supporting creators in that way.\nOther services have tried it but from what I can tell them, what streamers have told me, is that Twitch is really the leader in that way. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time on advertising, because there\u2019s no social media, content distribution service in the world that doesn\u2019t rely on advertising as a component. So ads have been a big focus.\nAnd the third piece, which is where we\u2019re behind, is sponsorships. We\u2019re now focused a lot on growing sponsorship opportunities for streamers and ensuring that we have three \u2014 based on what size you are, where you\u2019re located, how experienced you are, what type of content you\u2019re creating, where you\u2019re located in the world \u2014 three options to support you as a creator.\nI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of creators over the course of my career, and a common gripe seems to be that they can\u2019t subsist off of just subs and ad revenue. They have to have these branded partnerships that are difficult to land for midsize creators and smaller creators. What is Twitch doing specifically to diversify its branded partnership content?\nWe have this unique opportunity, being part of the third largest and fastest growing advertising business in the world, AKA Amazon. So what we\u2019re actively working on is, as advertisers that come in through Amazon advertising, that they understand the magic of Twitch, that they can easily set up influencer deals programmatically. And ultimately, you don\u2019t have the measurement that they expect.\nBut because of Amazon\u2019s diversity of advertisers, this is where before it was more focused on endemic advertisers, game publishers, et cetera. And now we\u2019re able to expand that reach to a much broader set of advertisers and serve the needs of both the affiliate marketing end of sponsorships, which is more of a performance model, as well as more of the top of the funnel, where you\u2019re looking for more brand awareness.\nObviously a lot of this discord among Twitch\u2019s community also comes at a time when other streaming platforms like YouTube or Kick are starting to take off, and enticing streamers with better revenue splits. A common complaint that I\u2019ve heard is that bigger streamers are going to be making money wherever they are, but smaller streamers who have less of an audience don\u2019t qualify for Partner Plus will get a better deal at YouTube or Kick than at Twitch. What is Twitch doing to keep those streamers?\nThere are a couple of things that I\u2019ll point out. One is acknowledging what Dan has done as the CEO to get out and engage with streamers, hear their concerns, and really influence our priorities as a company, is really a consequence of him both being an active streamer as well as being extremely engaged within the community.\nAnd then, more broadly for both Jeremy [Jeremy Forrester is VP of Community Product] and myself as the product leaders, building the product is continuing to innovate and ensure that we are absolutely a unique service. Whether that\u2019s features, like we\u2019re working on Stories, whether that\u2019s monetization \u2014 it\u2019s all in service of ensuring that livestreaming creators can be more successful on Twitch.\nFor a long time, there was a sort of exclusivity with Twitch, where there were exclusive deals, and simultaneous streaming on other platforms was forbidden. I have to wonder if those decisions to change these policies were in response to competition from other platforms.\nI would say it this way: I think they are an acknowledgement, and maybe a closer connectivity to the community via Dan specifically. I credit Dan in his short time as CEO to really make some big, hard decisions. Both the launch of Partner Plus, as well as simulcasting, the embed stuff we talked about in the keynote \u2014 these are three things that I think are very much an acknowledgement of the feedback from the community. We\u2019ve made that change, so I wouldn\u2019t call it out of competitive pressures. I would call it out of focus on the community.\n\nThis article, authored by Morgan Sung, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-26 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":401}
{"title":"Beeper Mini is back in operation after Apple\u2019s attempt to shut it down","context":"## Beeper Mini is back in operation after Apple\u2019s attempt to shut it down\n\nBeeper Mini, the app bringing blue bubble iMessage texts to Android users, is back in operation on Monday after a long weekend that saw Apple putting an end to Beeper\u2019s services, claiming it was a security risk. Now, the startup behind the new app says it has resumed functioning, but hasn\u2019t disclosed how that\u2019s been made possible. In addition, Beeper Mini will be free for the time being given the unstable nature of Beeper\u2019s status and Apple\u2019s attempts at shutting it down.\nFounded by former Pebble smartwatch founder Eric Migicovsky, Beeper had originally been working on an app that aggregated all of a user\u2019s chat apps into a single interface. However, upon the discovery of new technology that allowed it to reverse-engineer the iMessage protocol, it set out to build a new app called Beeper Mini that solely focused on bringing iMessage chats to Android users for $1.99 per month. That included support for high-quality photos and videos, tapback reactions, typing indicators, read receipts and more.\nThe app quickly climbed into the top 20 in the Play Store\u2019s charts and saw over 100,000 downloads in its first 48 hours, the company claims.\nUnfortunately, Beeper Mini\u2019s success was short-lived. Only days after launching, Apple on Friday night took action against the startup, having found a way to stop Beeper Mini\u2019s messages from being passed from Android phones to its servers. The Cupertino tech giant explained that it needed to shut down the app because it \u201cposed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks.\u201d Essentially, Apple said that it couldn\u2019t verify that Beeper\u2019s claims of end-to-end encryption were true, and therefore it needed to take \u201csteps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage.\u201d\nAs the Beeper team scrambled for a fix, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) shamed Apple for its intervention in a post on X, formerly Twitter, saying \u201cGreen bubble texts are less secure. So why would Apple block a new app allowing Android users to chat with iPhone users on iMessage? Big Tech executives are protecting profits by squashing competitors. Chatting between different platforms should be easy and secure,\u201d she wrote.\nOn Monday, Beeper announced on its blog that it has updated the Beeper Mini app to fix the issue that \u201ccaused messages not to be sent or received.\u201d It hasn\u2019t said exactly how it\u2019s made that happen, but notes that the security of Beeper Mini remains unchanged \u2014 promising it still includes local, end-to-end encryption as previously described. Migicovsky told TechCrunch he can\u2019t share anything on that topic beyond what\u2019s already in the blog post.\nThough Beeper Mini is running again, there is a caveat: phone number registration isn\u2019t yet working. That means users will have to sign in with an Apple ID. The startup says it\u2019s working to address this too.\nIt has also decided to make Beeper Mini free for the time being, given how \u201cchaotic\u201d things have been over the past few days. \u201cAs soon as things stabilize (we hope they will), we\u2019ll look at turning on subscriptions again,\u201d the blog post reads.\nAlthough Beeper did not have its app reviewed by an independent third-party security firm before launch, it\u2019s challenging Apple to put it to the test.\n\u201cIf Apple doubts the security and privacy of our app, we\u2019re willing to share the entire Beeper Mini codebase with a mutually agreed upon 3rd party security research firm,\u201d the blog post stated. Asked if they would run an audit without Apple\u2019s participation, Migicovsky tells us he wants Apple to agree on the firm first. The company also said it would be willing to add a pager emoji to metadata on all its sent messages, which would allow the Messages app to filter out messages from Beeper Mini users.\nUsers can get the updated version of Beeper Mini from beeper.com\/update on their phone for the time being as the company has not yet submitted the new version to the Play Store, claiming it needs to do some final testing. But that means users are being asked to sideload the app update onto their devices, which is riskier than downloading from the Play Store, where apps undergo reviews and basic security checks. The app update is now live on Google Play (updated, 1:28 pm ET).\nThe update, which now prompts users to sign in with their Apple ID, also includes new features, like chats that will open at the last unread message and an improved video player, the blog post noted. In tests, signing in with our Apple ID generated an Apple prompt that noted our ID was being used to sign in with a device \u201cnear Los Angeles, CA\u201d (where we are not located.) We received an error message \u201c2FA submission error\u201d after updating the app, but an uninstall\/reinstall fixed this. We understand this is a known bug.\nAfter setting up the new Beeper Mini, a message appeared on our iPhone that said: \u201cDevice Added to Your Account. A Mac now has access to iMessage,\u201d which offers a hint as to Beeper\u2019s fix.\nApple has not yet gotten in touch directly with Beeper, having only released a statement to the press. It\u2019s unclear at this time if, how, or when it will be able to disable Beeper\u2019s updated build.\n\nThis article, authored by Sarah Perez, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-11 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":402}
{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and others","context":"## Know the price-matching policies for Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and others\n\nNothing is more frustrating than buying a new pair of headphones, an OLED TV, or a backpack just to find out that you could have gotten it for a lot cheaper somewhere else. In order to keep customers happy \u2014 and prevent them from going elsewhere \u2014 many retailers offer price-matching policies where they promise to match a lower price you\u2019ve found elsewhere. That\u2019s information that could come in handy now that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are just around the corner.\nWhat follows are the price-matching policies for a variety of major retailers. There are a few things to make note of here. First, all price-matching policies have a number of rules attached to them. We\u2019ve summarized some of the rules here, but you\u2019d be advised to go to the links that we\u2019ve provided and read the policy carefully. Second, and logically enough, retailers that serve as marketplaces for other sellers, such as Costco, don\u2019t have price-matching policies.\nLastly, there are always exceptions to the rules. If you\u2019re looking for a deal on a product and you know it\u2019s available for a lower price elsewhere (or it was previously offered at the same retailer), it never hurts to call or chat with a customer service rep and ask if they\u2019ll match the price. After all, what do you have to lose?\nIf Best Buy offers a better discount than Target on the latest Kindle Paperwhite, Target will refund you the difference. Photo by Chaim Gartenberg \/ The Verge\nAmazon doesn\u2019t offer price matching. Full stop. You can contact customer support, but even if you\u2019re an Amazon Prime customer, they\u2019re not likely going to help you out.\nThat said, Amazon does offer a pretty liberal return policy, meaning you can often return an item you purchased from Amazon if it\u2019s available for less elsewhere (or at Amazon). Then, you can just repurchase the product wherever it\u2019s cheapest.\nAs of October 22nd, Target will match the price of any item purchased online or in-store from Target that goes on sale through December 24th. However, the current price-matching policy doesn\u2019t apply to products you may have bought from one Target store and found for less at another.\nTarget will also match the price of items purchased from Amazon, Best Buy, and a select group of competitors if you ask for it at the time of or within 14 days of your purchase. You must bring the original ad or listing, whether digital or in print, along with your receipt into the store. Alternatively, you can call for online purchases at 1-800-591-3869 or chat online via contactus.target.com.\nBe mindful, however, that Target\u2019s policy excludes doorbusters and competitors\u2019 lightning sales, like those that Amazon offers. It also doesn\u2019t apply to products that require that you log in to see the price, \u201cMarketplace\u201d items from third-party sellers, or lower-priced items purchased from other Target stores.\nBest Buy\u2019s Price Match Guarantee states that a product could be eligible for a price reduction if it\u2019s new, identical to the competitor\u2019s product, immediately available at a qualifying competitor\u2019s store or on its site, and not shown on Best Buy\u2019s exclusion list (which includes \u201citems for sale the Friday before Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving\u201d).\nTo get the difference, you have to contact Best Buy via its on-site chat and be able to show the ad or website with a lower price point. Alternatively, you can call 1-888-237-8289 or visit any Best Buy or Pacific Sales store.\nBest Buy will also, upon request, match an in-store or online price that was lowered during the return and exchange period, which typically lasts up to 15 days.\nWalmart doesn\u2019t price-match the prices of its competitors, though Walmart\u2019s online store offers price-matching on items purchased from Walmart stores if the item is in stock at Walmart.com.\nHowever, the policy doesn\u2019t apply to those who live in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico. Additionally, it doesn\u2019t apply to special event prices, like those seen during Black Friday. Walmart also does not retroactively price-match items bought from Walmart.com that have dropped in price after the time of purchase. The retailer additionally doesn\u2019t price-match items purchased from Walmart Marketplace retailers or third-party sellers.\nApple doesn\u2019t offer a price-matching policy, though you can price-match on devices like the 15-inch MacBook Air \u2014 assuming it\u2019s on sale \u2014 elsewhere. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales \/ The Verge\nWhile we\u2019ve seen some claims that Apple will price-match up to 10 percent for products bought at certain major retailers, there is no official policy on the company\u2019s website.\nApple does say that if it reduces its price on an Apple-branded product within 14 days from when you received your item, you can visit an Apple Store or contact the Apple Contact Center at 1-800-676-2775 to request a refund or get credit for the price difference. However, that doesn\u2019t apply to special sales like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.\nB&H says that it might be able to honor a current lower price or match the price of a competitor, but it does so on a case-by-case basis. You have to contact its Customer Service team using the on-site chat, email, or by calling 800-606-6969 \/ 212-444-6615.\nCostco does not price-match with competitors. However, according to the website, it will issue a credit for the difference between the price a member has paid and a promotional price if you bought the item online at Costco and requested the credit up to 30 days before the change in price. If you bought the product from a Costco warehouse location, visit the membership counter at the store where you made the purchase. Costco doesn\u2019t price-match items bought from Costco warehouses with Costco.com purchases.\nDell will price-match identical products from Dell, Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, HP, Apple, Lenovo, and a number of other retailers. You can call 1-877-275-3355 or chat online to run a price check, but you\u2019ll need to provide a link to the competitor\u2019s product.\nYou can also contact the company about a price difference within 30 days of purchase. However, there is a long list of restrictions, and none of this is available between Thanksgiving Day and the Monday following Thanksgiving (or on Green Monday).\nAs a general rule, eBay doesn\u2019t match the prices of purchases made during the weeks of Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. It does, however, offer a generous price-matching policy for items bought before or after that time period. If you find a lower price from a qualifying competitor on an eBay Deal item that you bought within 48 hours \u2014 or on another product with the \u201cBest Price Guarantee\u201d symbol attached to it \u2014 you\u2019ll get \u201c110 percent\u201d of the difference. That means eBay will give you an eBay coupon for the difference in price between what you bought the item for and what the competitor is selling it for, plus an additional 10 percent of that price difference. Note, however, that these coupons will expire within 30 days of being issued.\nThe products must be new, unopened, and identical to the competitor\u2019s item. You have to contact eBay Customer Service, and if they verify your claims are legitimate, you will receive the coupon and be able to use it toward your next eBay purchase.\nGameStop does not mention an official price-matching policy on its website. Last year, however, GameStop tweeted that the store will price-match items sold and shipped by Amazon as long as they\u2019re available online or in-store. Although GameStop only mentioned Amazon in the tweet, others have reported that the store will price-match items purchased from Target and elsewhere.\nGoogle will match online pricing from select retailers \u2014 specifically Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, B&H Photo, and Target \u2014 if a request is made within the standard return period. It doesn\u2019t, however, match preorder pricing from other retailers or carrier deals. The product also must be identical, right down to the color and configuration, and must be in stock. Plus, you need to provide a public link to the promo page or product listing to verify the rival\u2019s price.\nYou may also get the difference if a product purchased from the Google Store lowers in price within the standard return period. To get the price match or correction, contact Google.\nThe Home Depot will match the price of identical, in-stock products from other retailers, except for membership-based wholesalers. The price-match policy does not apply to special events like Black Friday, though, and you must bring the ad or listing with you in-store to the register. Additionally, The Home Depot will only honor requests submitted by the original buyer \u2014 no friends or family allowed.\nYou could potentially buy HP\u2019s Spectre x360 14 at a lower price thanks to HP\u2019s price-matching policy. Image: Monica Chin \/ The Verge\nAccording to HP\u2019s website, the company will match the current pre-tax price for new comparable PCs and identical HP printer, display, and accessory model numbers from nationally recognized online retailers, such as Dell, Amazon, Newegg, and Best Buy. The specs have to be the same, but the product model number does not need to be identical for computers. You have to ask for the match at the time of purchase by calling 1-800-888-0229. You can\u2019t request a price match via email or chat, though, and the policy does not extend to items bought during promotional periods. It also doesn\u2019t apply to membership stores like Costco and Sam\u2019s Club.\nIf you find a comparable product at a lower price during the return period, you can email HP at myhpsales@hp.com. This only applies to branded HP products and doesn\u2019t apply to products purchased during certain promotional events. This includes Green Monday and products on sale during the week of Thanksgiving and the week after.\nLenovo matches pricing on comparable PCs from Lenovo, HP, or Dell with the same key specs as long as they\u2019re sold through a list of recognized retailers. The comparable PC must also be in stock and readily available from both Lenovo and the competing retailer, and you have to contact a Lenovo sales rep in order to facilitate the match.\nThat said, you can\u2019t take advantage of coupons or special discounts while receiving a price match, and the policy doesn\u2019t apply to membership stores like Costco. The policy also doesn\u2019t apply to \u201cMarketplace\u201d items where third parties fulfill the order, so double-check that you bought the product directly from the retailer.\nLenovo also offers a price guarantee refund for laptops and personal desktop computers bought from Lenovo.com within 30 days of purchase. To receive a refund, you must contact Customer Care and show the lower price of the identical product offered on Lenovo.com. This policy doesn\u2019t apply to doorbuster or clearance products, however.\nLowe\u2019s will match the price of identical, in-stock products when you present an ad, product listing, or photo from a qualifying online or local retailer, including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. The product must be purchased directly from the retailer and not a third-party seller, however, and it doesn\u2019t apply to special sales like Black Friday and other various holiday promotions. Lowe\u2019s also doesn\u2019t match prices from one Lowe\u2019s store to another. To request a price match, head to the store, call 1-877-465-6937, or chat online.\nIf Microsoft lowers the price of the Xbox Series X, Microsoft could refund you the difference. Photo by Vjeran Pavic \/ The Verge\nNow through January 31st, Microsoft will refund you the difference if it drops the price of a physical product purchased online from the Microsoft Store. The same policy also applies if you find the product on sale at a lower price at a qualifying retailer, such as Amazon or Best Buy.\nYou can contact Microsoft\u2019s Sales and Support team at 1-877-696-7786 to get a refund.

{"title":"The best Black Friday headphone deals from Sony, Apple, Bose, Beats and more","context":"## The best Black Friday headphone deals from Sony, Apple, Bose, Beats and more\n\nEngadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nBlack Friday is often a boon for deals on headphones and earbuds, and this year is no different. The shopping holiday has brought a plethora of deals on all kinds of headphones, include several top picks from our guides to the best wireless headphones, wireless earbuds, budget wireless earbuds and gaming headsets. Other popular models from the likes of Sony, Beats, Bose and Apple are discounted as well. All of this means it's an ideal time to pick up a new set, whether it's to give as a gift to someone on your holiday shopping list or just to replace your own aging cans. To help you get a good bargain, we've rounded up the best Black Friday deals on headphones and earbuds we could find for 2023.\nSony WH-1000XM5\nPhoto by Billy Steele \/ Engadget Sony WH-1000XM5 $328 $400 Save $72 Black Friday has brought the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones back down to its all-time lowest price. $328 at Amazon\nThe Sony WH-1000XM5 is down to $328 at Amazon, B&H and other retailers, which is a $72 drop and ties the lowest price we\u2019ve seen. This is the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones, and we gave it a review score of 95 last year. Its active noise cancellation (ANC) is among the better options we\u2019ve tested, its design is comfortable to wear over extended periods and its battery lasts a solid 30 or so hours per charge. The sound goes heavy on the bass by default, which should please fans of hip-hop and pop music, but you can customize the EQ curve through Sony\u2019s app. Like many Sony headphones, it also comes with a number of useful bonus features; \u201cSpeak-to-Chat,\u201d for instance, automatically pauses your music when you start speaking.\nSony WF-1000XM5\nFor an in-ear pair, the Sony WF-1000XM5 is also on sale for $248 at Amazon, B&H and others. (Yes, Sony\u2019s headphone naming scheme is bad.) That matches the lowest price we\u2019ve seen and comes in $52 below Sony\u2019s usual list price. This set tops our list of the best wireless earbuds and earned a score of 87 in our review this past July. Like the over-ear XM5 above, it offers a host of useful features, a warm yet customizable sound, powerful ANC and a comfortably snug fit that naturally isolates a good chunk of outside noise on its own. Battery life should sit around seven to eight hours with average use.\nSony WH-1000XM4\nIf you don\u2019t want to pay up for Sony\u2019s highest-end noise-canceling headphones, Amazon, Adorama and B&H have the older Sony WH-1000XM4 down to $248 as well. While that isn\u2019t an all-time low, it\u2019s $100 off Sony\u2019s list price and a little lower than the usual sale price we\u2019ve seen over the course of the year. The XM4 delivers similar ANC and battery performance as its successor and has nearly the same feature set. Unlike the XM5, it can also fold up for easier storage. However, its mics aren\u2019t as clear for calls, it\u2019s a little bulkier (though it\u2019s still comfy) and it sounds a bit boomier out of the box. But at this price, it\u2019s still a strong value. We gave it a 94 in our review back in 2020.\nApple AirPods Pro\nApple\u2019s AirPods Pro are on sale for $190 at Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best Buy. That's $60 less than buying from Apple directly and ties an all-time low. This is the \u201cbest for iOS\u201d pick in our wireless earbuds guide thanks to its suite of helpful Apple-specific features, including hands-free access to Siri, quick pairing with iPhones and device tracking through Apple\u2019s Find My network. Effective (if not class-leading) ANC, a superb transparency mode and a pleasantly warm sound also stand out. That said, the Pro\u2019s six-hour battery life is just average and, as with any set of AirPods, you pretty much have to be a dedicated Apple fan to get the most out of it.\nThis deal applies to the latest iteration of the earphones, which come with a USB-C charging case. If you don\u2019t mind using a Lightning charging case, Walmart has the previous version on sale for a new low of $169. Either way, we gave the AirPods Pro a review score of 88 last year.\nApple AirPods (3rd-gen)\nThe third-gen AirPods are available for $140 at Amazon, Target, Best Buy and others. Typically, these wireless earbuds have retailed between $10 and $20 higher in recent months, but steeper discounts have been uncommon. We gave this pair a review score of 88 back in 2021: There are certainly better-sounding options for the money, but the third-gen AirPods sound noticeably richer than their predecessor, and their haptic touch controls are altogether more convenient. This is another open design, though, so there still isn\u2019t much in the way of deep bass or noise cancellation. Not everyone will find the wider earpieces comfortable either.\nApple AirPods (2nd Gen)\nThe second-gen AirPods are down to $80 at Amazon and Target, which isn\u2019t an all-time low but comes in roughly $20 below the pair\u2019s usual street price in recent months. These are Apple\u2019s entry-level wireless earbuds, having launched way back in 2019. They\u2019re a bit tougher to recommend these days, as their one-size-fits-all design won\u2019t fit everyone and you can get better sound quality even at this discounted rate. But if you prefer an open design that doesn\u2019t completely seal off your ear canal or just want the typical AirPods conveniences for as cheap as possible, this is at least a more acceptable price.\nApple AirPods Max\nApple\u2019s top-of-the-line headphones, the AirPods Max, are discounted to $450 at Amazon and Best Buy. That\u2019s $20 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve seen but about $30 below the pair\u2019s usual street price. Apple itself sells the headphones for $550. The AirPods Max are still overpriced for most even with this discount, but they remain undeniably premium, with top-tier ANC, a superbly balanced sound profile, a high-quality aluminum design, reliable controls and all the usual AirPods features. They\u2019re hefty, though, and their included \u201ccase\u201d is bafflingly flimsy. We gave the AirPods Max a review score of 84 in late 2020.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones\nBose\u2019s new QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are $50 off at multiple retailers, bringing the over-ear cans down to $379. Outside of a very brief drop a few weeks back that may have been a pricing error, this is the first significant discount we\u2019ve seen. Bose only released the QuietComfort Ultra last month. We gave it a score of 86 in our review, praising its predictably comfy design, outstanding ANC, above-average call quality and bassy default sound. We still recommend the Sony XM5 to most, as that pair offers a wider feature set and the ability to be used passively (i.e., without being turned on), but the QuietComfort Ultra may still be worth a look if you must have especially powerful noise cancellation.\nWe\u2019ll also note that the new, non-Ultra QuietComfort Headphones are $100 off, bringing them down to a new low of $249. We haven\u2019t reviewed this model yet, but it\u2019s the follow-up to 2021\u2019s QuietComfort 45, which we generally liked. Other reviews suggest it has a more bass-heavy sound, though, and we\u2019d expect it to be a slight step down from the Ultra across the board.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds\nThe new Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, meanwhile, are down to $249 at several stores. That's another $50 discount and an all-time low. We gave these in-ears a review score of 88 in September and recently named them the \u201cbest for noise cancellation\u201d pick in our wireless earbuds buying guide. As that title suggests, the main reason to consider this pair over the Sony WF-1000XM5 is its ANC performance, which is the strongest we\u2019ve tested from a true wireless model. We also enjoy Bose\u2019s spatial audio tech. But the earpieces are on the larger side, the call quality and battery life (at six-ish hours) are just OK and there\u2019s no support for multi-device pairing.\nBeats Fit Pro\nThe Beats Fit Pro is back down to $159, which isn\u2019t an all-time low but is still roughly $20 below its average street price. This is the \u201cbest for workouts\u201d pick in our wireless earbuds buying guide, as it packs many of the iOS-friendly conveniences of Apple\u2019s AirPods in a sportier and more stable design. It also uses physical control buttons instead of touch panels, and its punchy sound plays well with most popular music. But it can\u2019t connect to multiple devices at once, it doesn\u2019t support wireless charging and its ANC, while fine, isn\u2019t as capable as the AirPods Pro\u2019s. The Fit Pro earned a score of 87 in our review from 2021.\nBeats Studio Pro\nThe Beats Studio Pro is down to $170 for Black Friday at Amazon, Target and Best Buy. That tops the pair\u2019s previous low by $10 and falls about $130 below its average street price in recent months. The Studio Pro isn\u2019t a top pick in any of our guides, but we gave it a solid review score of 81 in July. Its sound is largely pleasant and even-handed, its ANC is strong enough to be useful and it can stream higher-quality audio if you connect over a USB-C cable. It works well with both iOS and Android, too, though it doesn\u2019t support multi-device pairing on the former. There\u2019s no auto-pausing when you remove the headphones, either, and the design is mostly made of plastic. But if you like the Beats style, those flaws should be a little easier to accept at this price.\nAmazon Echo Buds (2023)\nWe recommend the Amazon Echo Buds in our budget wireless earbuds guide to those who hate the feeling of traditional in-ear headphones. They\u2019re now down to $35 for Black Friday, a $15 drop that matches an all-time low. The Echo Buds have a semi-open design, so they let in a good amount of outside noise and can\u2019t produce deep bass, but some will find the shape preferable to a pair that sticks in their ear canals. They can sound perfectly decent with a bit of EQ tweaking, while features like multi-device pairing, wear detection and hands-free Alexa are all nice to have. However, there\u2019s no wireless charging, the battery life (five or so hours per charge) is mediocre and the IPX2 sweat-resistance rating is too weak for the gym. Amazon\u2019s companion app is rather bloated too. But those shouldn\u2019t be deal-breakers for $35. We gave the Echo Buds a review score of 77 in July.\nAnker Soundcore Space A40\nThe Anker Soundcore Space A40 is one of the best values in wireless earphones at its normal price of $79, but now it\u2019s down to $54 for Black Friday. That ties the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked. The Space A40 tops our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds because it delivers most of the features we expect from headphones that cost twice as much. It\u2019s comfortable, its ANC is genuinely capable, its battery lasts up to 10 hours per charge, its tiny case supports wireless charging and it can pair with two devices at once. Its warm sound will be pleasing enough for most by default, but it can also be customized through a clean companion app. The only major downsides are middling mic quality and a lack of auto-pausing when you remove an earbud.\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC\nThe Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC is the runner up in our budget wireless earbuds guide, as it offers a highly similar feature set as the Space A40 but comes in a larger \u201cstem\u201d design reminiscent of Apple\u2019s AirPods. It has a more bass-forward sound by default, which some may find fatiguing, but it also has slightly more extensive touch controls and technically supports wear detection. Right now the Liberty 4 NC is down to $70 at Amazon, B&H and Best Buy, which beats its previous low by $10 and falls $30 below Anker\u2019s list price. If you prefer this kind of bulkier but easier-to-remove shape, this is an excellent value.\nAnker Soundcore Space Q45\nIf you\u2019re after a wallet-friendly pair of noise-canceling over-ear headphones, Anker\u2019s Soundcore Space Q45 is worth a look at its Black Friday price of $100. For that amount, this pair\u2019s better-than-average ANC, softly padded design and multi-device pairing make for a strong value. Its V-shaped sound profile isn\u2019t especially detailed, but it can work well enough for pop music and it\u2019s customizable through Anker\u2019s app. Call quality is mediocre, however. This $50 discount matches the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked, and it's available at both Amazon and Anker's online store; just use the on-page coupon for the latter.\nAudio-Technica ATH-M20xBT\nThe Audio-Technica ATH-M20xBT is a modest $10 off for Black Friday, bringing the wireless headphones down to $69. We saw this pair fall to $55 during Amazon\u2019s Prime Day sale in July, but this is about as low as it\u2019s been outside of that. The M20 is the budget pick in our wireless headphones guide thanks to its comfortable fit, 60-hour battery life, multi-device connectivity and relatively detailed audio quality. It lacks ANC and doesn\u2019t have the sturdiest design, but it should do the job if you just need a no-frills wireless headphone for cheap.\nEarFun Free 2S\nThe EarFun Free 2S is down to $24.59 at Amazon with a Prime-only discount and the checkout code FREE2SPD1. That\u2019s an all-time low. The Free 2S is the \u201cbest under $50\u201d pick in our budget wireless earbuds guide. It has a hugely bass-forward sound out of the box, but some may enjoy that with hip-hop or EDM and the profile is customizable through the EarFun app. The earpieces are comfortable and fully waterproof, the battery lasts around seven hours, and the suite of touch controls work reliably, which isn\u2019t a given in this price range. There\u2019s no ANC, multi-device connectivity or wear detection, however, and the built-in mic will pick up wind noise if you\u2019re on a call outside.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro + $10 Amazon gift card\nThe Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are on sale for $160 for Black Friday, and you can get them with a $10 Amazon gift card for no extra cost. That\u2019s a good way from their all-time low \u2014 they very briefly fell to $105 last year \u2014 but it\u2019s still $30 or so less than their average selling price in recent months. While the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro aren\u2019t a top pick in any of our guides, they\u2019re worth a look if you use a Galaxy phone, as they can quickly pair with and swap between other Samsung devices (including TVs) and support a higher-quality audio codec on the company\u2019s handsets. More generally, this is one of the better sounding pairs of wireless earphones we\u2019ve tested, with impressive clarity and well-controlled bass, and the buds themselves are both comfortable and waterproof. You can\u2019t connect to two devices at once, however, and the five-hour battery life is poor. We gave the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro a review score of 86 last year.\nJabra Elite 3\nAnother pick from our budget wireless earbuds guide, the Jabra Elite 3, is down to $40 at Best Buy. That matches the best price we\u2019ve tracked. This pair\u2019s mildly bass-boosted sound is great for the money, and its snug, IP55-rated design is well-suited for workouts. It\u2019s a relatively basic set, though, as it lacks ANC, multi-device pairing, wireless charging and wear detection. But those omissions are easier to accept for $40. We gave the Elite 3 a score of 88 in our review from September 2021.\nJLab Go Air Pop\nThe JLab Go Air Pop is available for $17 at Amazon, which isn't an all-time low \u2014 the pair was briefly down to just $10 at Walmart earlier this week \u2014 but still takes about $6 off their usual going rate. We highlight the Go Air Pop as an honorable mention in our budget wireless earbuds guide. Its IPX4-rated design is light and generally comfortable, its battery lasts around eight or nine hours per charge and, unlike many cheap earphones, its touch controls actually work. Its boomy sound profile won\u2019t win any awards, predictably, but it\u2019s well beyond serviceable for less than $20. JLab even bakes three different EQ presets directly into the earphones. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap backup to your main wireless earphones, this is a great value.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro are available for a new low of $115 at Wellbots, which is about $50 off their average street price. Other retailers like Amazon and Best Buy have them for $5 more. We call the Pixel Buds Pro the best option for Android users in our wireless earbuds buying guide due to their tight integration with the OS (and Google\u2019s Pixel phones in particular). Their ANC and V-shaped sound are solid (if not superlative) as well, and they can last between up to 11 hours depending on how often you use the former. The fit may be tricky for those with smaller ear canals, though. We gave this pair a score of 87 in our review last year.\nBeyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X\nBeyerdynamic's DT 900 Pro X headphones are down to $249 at Amazon and Target from a trusted third-party seller. That\u2019s only $20 off their usual going rate, but we haven\u2019t seen many larger discounts over the past few months. The DT 900 Pro X is a wired pair of open-back headphones designed for critical listening at home. It\u2019s currently the top pick in our guide to the best headphones for gaming, as its wonderfully spacious sound does well to envelop you in the fine details of any given game. Like most open-back cans, it can\u2019t produce truly deep sub-bass, but it delivers enough low-end to give in-game explosions a powerful sense of impact. A set of soft velour earpads keep the whole thing comfortable, though it can\u2019t fold up, and the open design means it won\u2019t block much external noise when you\u2019re outside of the house.\nSennheiser HD 560S\nThe Sennheiser HD 560S is another open-back pair of wired headphones we highlight in our gaming headset guide. It\u2019s down to $150 at Amazon, B&H, Sennheiser\u2019s online store and other retailers \u2014 that\u2019s not an incredible deal, as the pair often sold for the same rate earlier in the year, but it\u2019s about $30 less than the street price we\u2019ve seen since the summer. Regardless, the HD 560S offers a pleasingly balanced, spacious and detailed sound profile and a frame that\u2019s comfortable to wear for extended periods. It can sometimes sound a little piercing in the treble, it\u2019s not as sturdily built as the DT 900 Pro X and, again, it\u2019ll leak and let in lots of noise. But if you want audio-centric headphones for less than $200, this is one of the better options in the price range.\nIn other Sennheiser deals, the Drop X Sennheiser HD 6XX is on sale for $169 at Drop, a $50 discount that\u2019s only $10 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked. We haven\u2019t formally reviewed this pair, but Engadget\u2019s audio expert Billy Steele gave some positive impressions in a hands-on way back in 2016, and the pair upon which it\u2019s based (the Sennheiser HD 650) has long been a favorite among audiophiles. If you\u2019d prefer an open-back pair with a little more bass warmth, it might be worth a look.\nAstro A40 TR\nOur favorite dedicated gaming headset for most people, the Astro A40 TR, is down to $100 at Amazon. That\u2019s a $30 discount. This deal bundles the headset with Astro\u2019s MixAmp M80, an optional amp that connects to Xbox controllers and provides various audio controls. Even without the accessory, we like the open-back A40 for providing a wider soundstage than most gaming headsets. It\u2019s not as open or detailed as the Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X or Sennheiser HD 560S, and it misses more detail in the treble range, but it\u2019s immersive, with a slight bass boost gives in-game effects a little extra boom. The headset as a whole looks \u201cgamer-y,\u201d but it\u2019s comfortable. And while its built-in mic isn\u2019t the clearest we\u2019ve tested, it\u2019s at least serviceable for basic chat.\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2\nIf all you want is a decent gaming headset for as little as possible, the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 is worth considering at $35. That\u2019s only $5 below its usual going rate, but it matches the lowest price we\u2019ve seen. The Cloud Stinger 2 is the budget pick in our gaming headset guide: It sounds narrower and less balanced than the Astro A40, but its built-in mic is great for the money and its bass-heavy profile at least makes action scenes feel a little more exciting. It\u2019s all comfy, too, though it\u2019s largely made of plastic.\nLogitech G535\nThe Logitech G535 is another honorable mention in our gaming headsets guide, one that should specifically appeal to those who want a wireless option for less than $100. If that\u2019s you, good news: It\u2019s available for just under $80 at Amazon, B&H and Best Buy, which is about $25 off its usual street price. The G535\u2019s noticeably light frame, relatively balanced sound and Bluetooth support all impress for the price; just note that it doesn\u2019t work with Xbox, and that its mic sounds a bit thinner than the wired headsets highlighted above. Its battery life clocks in at 30 to 35 hours per charge, which is decent but not great.\nShokz OpenRun Pro\nPhoto by Jon Turi \/ Engadget Shokz OpenRun Pro $125 $180 Save $55 If you want a pair of headphones that don't totally shut you out from the outside world, the bone-conducting Shokz OpenRun Pro are worth a look. $125 at Amazon\nThe Shokz OpenRun Pro is back down to $125 for Black Friday, which is $25 more than its all-time low but $55 less than its usual street price. These are bone conduction headphones, which means they go around the side of your head and deliver sound via vibrations to your skull. If you want to listen to music and podcasts without totally blocking the outside world, they might make sense. The flipsides are that they\u2019re harder to use in noisier areas and, generally speaking, not as full-sounding as traditional in-ear headphones. Engadget Editor Jon Turi found this pair to deliver more low-end depth than most of its peers, however. It can also last up to 10 hours per charge.\nYour Black Friday Shopping Guide: See all of Yahoo\u2019s Black Friday coverage, here. Follow Engadget for Black Friday tech deals.

{"title":"Kick streamers consider leaving over CEO\u2019s comments in a sex worker \u2018prank\u2019 stream","context":"## Kick streamers consider leaving over CEO\u2019s comments in a sex worker \u2018prank\u2019 stream\n\nKick streamers consider leaving over CEO\u2019s comments in a sex worker \u2018prank\u2019 stream With little moderation, many question if Kick is safe. Others can't afford to stop streaming.\nStreamers are leaving Kick en masse in protest of the platform\u2019s lack of safety guidelines, after a prominent creator streamed an encounter with a sex worker without informing her that there were other people present. She was briefly prevented from leaving after she expressed discomfort, while Kick\u2019s CEO posted laughing emotes in the stream chat.\n\u201cIt sucks to see a platform stand behind someone who clearly doesn\u2019t respect sex workers or their safety,\u201d Rachel, a streamer known as TheFoodieWaifu, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis was a job for her and to them a game. This woman clearly was afraid and was just trying to work and be safe.\u201d\nPaul Denino, a creator also known as Ice Poseidon, streamed the encounter on September 21. The interactions with the sex worker took place in a living room, while Denino and fellow streamer Sam Pepper hid in an adjacent bedroom. The stream shows another man, named Andy, paying the sex worker $500 and asking for her consent to film. When the encounter became physical, Denino and Pepper made noises behind the door, which startled the woman. She tried to leave after receiving a text about the people in the other room, but Andy stopped her. When Andy reminded her that he had already paid her, she said the encounter was \u201ccreepy.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is it creepy?\u201d Andy said. \u201cIt\u2019s you and me and no one else.\u201d\nIn a post days later, Denino disputed claims of a \u201chidden camera\u201d and alleged that the interaction was legal. Denino streamed from Brisbane, Australia, where sex work is legal in licensed brothels or if a sex worker is working in private and alone. He also posted footage of a call allegedly asking the sex worker he could film her, which she approved for an extra fee. Later in the clip, he tells Andy that he can\u2019t block the sex worker from leaving.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the mention that you two were hiding in the room? Creepy as fuck,\u201d Repzion, another creator who streams on Kick, replied. \u201cDid she consent to that? When she found that out, she left because she was uncomfortable. It\u2019s shitty regardless.\u201d\nKick has lured disenchanted Twitch streamers away from the platform with non-exclusive streaming deals, light moderation and a coveted 95\/5 revenue split. The platform is young, but its first year has been checkered with controversy \u2014 starting with its ties to a crypto gambling site also owned by Kick CEO Eddie Craven. The most recent scandal is a wake-up call for many of its streamers \u2014 especially women who question if the platform is safe for them at all.\nThe platform addressed the incident in a public post earlier this week, affirming that community and public safety \u201ccannot be compromised\u201d in content creation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuously learning where this balance sits and are making changes daily,\u201d the post continued. \u201cWe appreciate our community for the continuous feedback, both the good & the bad. We\u2019ll keep you updated on upcoming changes to community guidelines and subsequent enforcement measures.\u201d\nKick did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment. In a statement to 404 Media, the company said that they \u201ccontinuously review and refine\u201d its policies, but may not disclose specific details \u201cfor privacy and confidentiality reasons.\u201d\n\u201cWe aim to maintain a fair and consistent approach to content moderation while respecting the privacy of our users and employees,\u201d the statement said.\nThe company also removed Denino from the front page and featured category, which Bree, another Kick streamer, described as a \u201cstart.\u201d Returning to Twitch isn\u2019t an option for her, she said, because of the harassment she faced on the platform.\n\u201cKick\u2019s decision not to ban him does hurt, but I do think that from a business standpoint with contracts involved you can\u2019t just ban someone,\u201d she said in a DM. \u201cI feel like a lot of people are focusing on this while our time could be better spent working together to make our platform better.\u201d\nSo many people will say \u201coh go back to twitch\u201d\u2026 I can\u2019t. That platform let creators openly harass, bully, abuse, oppress and threaten my life multiple times. I don\u2019t feel safe there and I never will. I\u2019m stuck rn. This is my livelihood and how I keep a roof over my head. \u2014 Bree (@KickBree) September 24, 2023\nKick\u2019s pallid response infuriated both streamers and viewers. Bob, a creator known as BobDuckNWeave, described the incident as \u201cjust sickening\u201d and criticized the platform\u2019s \u201cnon-response.\u201d\n\u201cI understand consent was in fact given by the woman on stream, but the premise alone was bad enough for a site seemingly focused on gaming\/creative content,\u201d he said over DM.\nHe is one of many streamers who vowed to leave the platform in the aftermath of the incident.\nIn a thread announcing his departure, he apologized for his association with the platform, and told TechCrunch that he thought it would get better.\nBob acknowledged that the platform has had a string of controversies in its short existence \u2014 most recently, an offensive fake interview between white supremacist sympathizer Adin Ross, accused sex trafficker Andrew Tate and a Kim Jong Un impersonator \u2014 and that seeing Craven laughing at the sex worker was \u201cmore than enough to stamp out any hope that the platform intends to improve any of its policies.\u201d\nRachel, who also makes cooking videos on YouTube, also decided to leave Kick despite the opportunities it gave her as a smaller creator. She started streaming on the platform because she was burning out on Twitch, and believed that Kick would figure out stronger moderation with time.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand behind a platform that thinks it\u2019s OK to view people as objects,\u201d she said in a DM. \u201cI am not saying if folks choose to stay on the platform that they are for encouraging this behavior. I am saying that for me, I can no longer say I stream on Kick. This will be a [financial] hit most definitely, not as much for some bigger streamers, but still enough to feel it with inflation being at its highest right now.\u201d\nBut others can\u2019t afford to take the hit, and can\u2019t rely on Twitch alone to pay their bills.\nThe default sub (subscription) revenue split for Partners is 50\/50, but select streamers were offered a premium 70\/30 deal until last year. Twitch cut that deal in favor of the platform\u2019s ad revenue program, which angered many of its most loyal creators. Partners grandfathered into the agreement were still paid a 70% cut of the first $100,000 they earned, and 50% of any revenue after that.\nThe platform rolled out a new Partner Plus program this year, which allowed qualifying streamers to apply for the same deal given to streamers grandfathered into the 70\/30 split. The steep requirements excludes the majority of Twitch Partners and doesn\u2019t count gifted subs toward the minimum subscription requirement, further straining the relationship between the platform and its creators. Although Twitch adjusted the program so that higher tier subscriptions count for more points toward the minimum subscription requirement, it wasn\u2019t the change that streamers were requesting.\nKelly, a streamer known as MrsViolence, joined Twitch when it was still operating as Justin.tv. She began streaming full time when she had to step away from her esports coaching and hosting career for her health. Like many streamers who joined Twitch before its explosive pandemic growth, Kelly was offered a 70\/30 revenue split. About a year ago, before Twitch axed the premium revenue deal, Kelly\u2019s Twitch income was a little over $1,000 per month (up to $1,200 on a \u201creally good month\u201d) with over 700 paying subscribers. She supplemented her income with tips and OnlyFans subscriptions.\nWhen the revenue split changes went into effect earlier this year, Kelly\u2019s monthly income fell to about $400. Since she stopped prioritizing her Twitch channel, her monthly Twitch income hovers around $120. That prompted her to start streaming on Kick, where she said she makes over $1,000 per month with only 145 subscribers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s covering all of my rent and groceries and then like a night out with my boyfriend,\u201d Kelly said in a call with TechCrunch. \u201cSo I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s run by some gambling, underground Dark Web loser. It\u2019s making people money and it\u2019s helping them in the worst economic depression we have ever seen.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say that Ice Poseidon\u2019s stream didn\u2019t affect her.\n\u201cI broke down in tears,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was like, now I\u2019m part of this website that has pieces of shit running fucking wild and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it, and I refuse to go back and make pennies on Twitch.\u201d\nAs a creator who\u2019s been working in the games industry for more than a decade, Kelly said she\u2019ll continue making content wherever she can make money, because her chronic health conditions prevent her from returning to in-person hosting and coaching. She experienced \u201cjust as much abuse\u201d as a woman on Twitch, and isn\u2019t optimistic about other livestreaming platforms like Rumble or YouTube. Kelly added that in its early days, Twitch was just as unmoderated and violently misogynistic as parts of Kick are today. The streaming community can\u2019t rely on platforms to operate in the best interest of their creators, she said, and instead has to hope that local governments will step in to regulate safety.\n\u201cI feel very small. There\u2019s nothing we can do and it\u2019s a fight that I think too many people are investing their lives in, and changing their careers over, their money, their income, because of something you can\u2019t change,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI\u2019m very numb. Desensitized is a great word. I feel for people, I get it. But at the same time I got to survive in this dumb world. Like, gas is up again!\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Morgan Sung, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-09-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":405}

The ball was hot, the ball was moving and everybody contributed today.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSydney only had themselves to blame for the loss as they went 10-of-37 from three-point range.\nJaylen Adams (18 points, 10 rebounds) and Jordan Hunter (16, five) couldn\u2019t lift the Kings over the line.\n\u201cSometimes you just miss shots,\u201d Kings coach Mahmoud Abdelfattah said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been practising these for the last two-and-a-half months, we got some great looks and at the end of the day that\u2019s the difference.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re missing a ton of shots you\u2019ve got to win the offensive rebounding battle and they beat us on that.\u201d\nTasmania burst out to a double-figure lead when they piled on 36 points during the opening period, and the margin blew out to 18 before halftime.\nDoyle (12 points), Deng and Jack McVeigh (both 10) all did plenty of damage on the scoreboard in the first half for the visitors, who never trailed. Galloway\u2019s huge dunk sparked Sydney early in the third period and they cut the margin to three.\nAdvertisement\nBut he and Bolden soon exited and Crawford\u2019s scintillating run gave the JackJumpers the upper hand. The Kings are hopeful Galloway will be fit for Saturday\u2019s trip to take on the Cairns Taipans.\n\u201cThe doctors may have other plans, but he\u2019s doing alright,\u201d Abdelfattah said. \u201cObviously he was out for the rest of the game and he\u2019s in pain a little bit, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nGoulding\u2019s golden touch too much for Breakers\nVeteran shooter Chris Goulding has fired a series of clutch three-pointers to pilot NBL ladder leaders Melbourne United to a 97-88 win over New Zealand.\nGoulding had a quiet first half but drove daggers into the visitors at John Cain Arena on Sunday when he found range after the main break.\nIn his 300th game for Melbourne, Goulding delivered his trademark when he twice launched crucial bombs to help his team edge ahead in the dying stages of a tight contest.\nGoulding\u2019s fade-away from the corner gave United a game-high nine-point lead with three minutes left as he finished with 4-of-5 shooting from distance.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe can\u2019t not talk about CG\u2019s couple of threes down the stretch,\u201d coach Dean Vickerman told reporters post-game. \u201cThey were pretty incredible.\u201d\nJo Lual-Acuil (16 points) and import Ian Clark (18) also came up with big plays in the final period as Melbourne outscored their opponents 33-25 with the game on the line.\nLual-Acuil shone in his second game back from a long-term wrist injury, and Clark\u2019s wide-open three restored United\u2019s nine-point buffer with 38 seconds left to play. Such was Goulding\u2019s confidence in his teammate, he turned around to celebrate the game-sealing bucket with the home crowd before Clark had even released his shot.\nMelbourne had five scorers in double figures in an even team performance in the absence of injured guard Matthew Dellavedova, who has missed two games because of his latest concussion setback.\nThe result was Melbourne\u2019s ninth consecutive home win over New Zealand and gave them a 6-1 record for the season.\nThe Breakers (1-2) led by six points midway through the third period but ran out of steam in a tough loss that ended a gruelling road trip, which included two exhibition matches against NBA opposition in the United States.\nAdvertisement\nZylan Cheatham (30 points) and Parker Jackson-Cartwright (18) threatened to drive the Breakers to a rousing victory until the guard fouled out inside the last four minutes.\nFormer NBA forward Anthony Lamb had 15 points and five rebounds on his NBL debut for New Zealand after signing as a replacement for injured import Justinian Jessup.\nBut Breakers coach Mody Maor was in no mood to look for positives in his team\u2019s performance.\n\u201cWe have very high standards for how we want to play and this isn\u2019t it,\u201d Maor said. \u201cLack of focus, missing key players, making mistakes on covers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care where we flew from, what our schedule is, what happened the day before \u2013 I care zero. This isn\u2019t the level of execution that we expect from ourselves.\u201d\nShea Ili (16 points, four assists) was important for Melbourne and Luke Travers finished with 16 points, including 15 in the first half.\nSixers, Phoenix continue to rise\nAdvertisement\nThe Adelaide 36ers have told each other some hard truths before responding in style to heap more pressure on the Perth Wildcats with their 89-78 victory.\nIn the other NBL match on Saturday, South East Melbourne Phoenix made it three straight wins, beating the Bullets 96-73 as Alan Williams led the way against a side looking lost without the suspended Aron Baynes.\nIn Adelaide, the 36ers responded to a disappointing loss on Thursday night, also at home to the Phoenix, and handed the Wildcats a third straight defeat with their 11-point win.\nSitting in bottom spot with one win from five games coming into the macth, the players got together to draw a line in the sand.\nIt certainly worked and their effort, energy and desperation was dramatically improved against Perth, but so was the execution and a focus on getting Isaac Humphries more involved inside.\nHe put up 26 points and eight rebounds in a match-winning performance but the shortening of the rotation to use just eight players from coach CJ Bruton worked too.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe met as a playing group yesterday and talked through a lot of stuff,\u201d Humphries said.\n\u201cWe just wanted to come out today and put into action everything we talked about.\n\u201cWe executed what the coaches needed from us tonight and we executed what we, as a playing group, wanted to execute as well.\u201d\nA third straight defeat for the Wildcats has them struggling at 2-4 this season.\nCoach John Rillie is focused know they aren\u2019t playing well and the improvement needs to start offensively.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing good basketball at this point in time,\u201d Rillie said.\n\u201cAn area we need to improve on is our offence. That\u2019s where we have to find some type of rhythm and we\u2019ve yet to do that in these last couple of games.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe game\u2019s played at both ends and you need to find a rhythm to generate some natural enthusiasm, and we haven\u2019t been able to do that for good stretches.\u201d\nBrisbane coach Justin Schueller always knew losing his superstar centre Baynes with a five-game suspension was going to be challenging, but that was magnified on Saturday night.\nWilliams produced 21 points and six rebounds for South East Melbourne but Brisbane will still be without Baynes for next weekend\u2019s double-header away to Perth and at home to Tasmania, and he needs to find some answers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have solutions right now for two more games without Banger (Baynes) and that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s sitting right in the front of my head, but scoring 73 points isn\u2019t enough to get it done in this league,\u201d Schueller said.\n\u201cThen giving them 96 is way too many as well so we have a lot of stuff that we still have to work on.\u201d\nJLA return lifts United to win in Wollongong\nAdvertisement\nMelbourne United have celebrated the long-awaited return of Jo Lual-Acuil but it was fellow centre Ariel Hukporti who starred in a 101-91 defeat of the lllawarra Hawks.\nNBL heavyweights United only kicked clear from last season\u2019s wooden spooners towards the end of the third quarter following a high-scoring first half at WIN Entertainment Centre on Friday.\nAgain sloppy from the field, the Hawks missed nine consecutive shots to finish the third period as United (5-1) opened up a 14-point lead that proved match-winning.\n\u201cWe just have these patches against really good basketball teams that let us down,\u201d said Hawks coach Jacob Jackomas.\n\u201cThe shots weren\u2019t disgusting today, just some little things right now. We said that before with the team is that we need to do all the little things right against this basketball team and we didn\u2019t.\u201d\nBig man Gary Clark (17 points) was one of few Hawks who got his eye in, with imports Tyler Harvey (19 points, six from 16 attempts) and Justin Robinson (nine points, two from eight) again struggling.\nRobinson was one of three Hawks to foul out, alongside big men Sam Froling and Lachlan Olbrich.\nAdvertisement\nDespite Illawarra\u2019s shooting issues, United gave up more first half points (51) than in any other of their games this season.\nThe Hawks dominated the offensive glass (18-10) and punished United with 21 points from turnovers.\nBut they finished the day shooting at 38 per cent from the field to United\u2019s 53, which made things difficult, especially when United locked the paint down in the third quarter.\n\u201cIt took us a little bit of time to wake up with their physicality and the way they got after it,\u201d said United coach Dean Vickerman.\nNBL champion Lual-Acuil returned from a wrist injury for the first minutes of his United comeback, while NBA hopeful Hukporti (21 points, 10 rebounds) shone for the visitors.\nHukporti was United\u2019s rock under the basket and a defensive board in the final minute sealed his third double-double from five games this season.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve found my role in the team now, it took me a while because I\u2019m coming off the (achilles) injury and it was a year out,\u201d Hukporti said.\nThat is vintage Tyler Harvey ????\n\nCan he pull the Hawks back into this one?\n\nCatch the last quarter live on ESPN via Kayo ????

Move on.\n\u201cIf you wanted to do something more, look after the kid.\n\u201cTalk to him, championship ceremony or whatever \u2026 but that\u2019s on them (Sydney).\n\u201cThat\u2019s not on us or me.\u201d\nVasiljevic scored 17 points in his Adelaide debut on Thursday, including 11 in a productive first quarter, but he couldn\u2019t prevent the bottom-placed Sixers from suffering a 102-85 loss to South East Melbourne Phoenix.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI thought his energy was good,\u201d Bruton said of his prized recruit.\n\u201cWith more time to settle in, the better he\u2019ll become.\u201d\n\u00a9 AAP\n\nThis article, authored by The Roar, was published by The Roar | Sports Writers Blog on 2023-10-19 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":406}

I\u2019ve always been committed to Australian rugby, want to leave it in a better place and that\u2019s still the job. \u201c\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\nHe was asked about his pre-tournament press conference where he attacked reporters\u2019 negativity \u2013 \u201cI probably need to give myself an uppercut, don\u2019t I?\u201d he joked.\nJones said he accepted that a review would be required into the World Cup flop, but his statement puts the ball firmly in Rugby Australia\u2019s court as far as his future goes.\nSo far RA have said they intend backing Jones and he said he believed he had official support. He refused to answer a question on potential break clauses in his contract with RA.\nAdvertisement\nOn whether he will see out his contract through the end of 2027, Jones said: \u201cIt\u2019s not absolutely my decision. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a review going forward and let\u2019s see what happens at the end of the review.\nHe said he was not worried about being sacked but accepted it was possible.\n\u201cI don\u2019t control those sort of things. All I can do is coach. I went to the World Cup, came in for a short period of time and had to make a decision on the team, made the decision we needed to go with youth, and whilst the results in the World Cup weren\u2019t the results we wanted, I think I\u2019ve left the Australian team in a great position to go on to 2027.\n\u201cThat judgment will be decided by the 2027 World Cup.\u201d\nHe said the team \u2013 including coaches and players \u2013 have already completed their own review of the World Cup disaster. The next one would be \u201ca formal review to be done by independent consultants\u201d and he was ready to participate.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come back to Australia to have a holiday \u2013 sit down at Coogee Beach, eat fish and chips, have a nice flat white. It was always going to be a battle. When you\u2019ve got a team that hasn\u2019t done well for a long period of time, it\u2019s always a battle.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nJones said it was crucial that Rugby Australia got alignment in the code from grassroots through to the top team as it looks to rebuild it\u2019s international standing. Australia, a two-time world champion, is currently ranked 10th in the world.\n\u201cYou just got to watch the quarterfinals at the weekend. We\u2019re not at that level. And we can\u2019t pretend to be at that level. But can we be at that level by 2027? Yes, we can,\u201d said Jones.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely off the pace but the opportunity to get better is there. I love the game. I love working with young players. I loved seeing some of the young players maturing during the World Cup and some of them struggle. And that\u2019s all part of it. But I love the game and I love coaching the Wallabies.\u201d\nJones was named Wallabies coach at the start of the year as replacement for Dave Rennie. He came in with grand statements that his team could win the Rugby Championship, Bledisloe Cup and make a smash and grab on the World Cup.\nNone of those targets were achieved and Jones changed his tune about building for the future when he named a young team for the doomed Cup campaign \u2013 where his team became the first Australians to bow out of a RWC in the pool stages.\nHe finished the year with a 2-7 win loss record \u2013 the only two victories coming against lowly Georgia and Portugal.\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday he said he no regrets with leaving experienced players such as Quade Cooper and Michael Hooper out of the side for the tournament.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their own judgment and they\u2019re allowed to have that judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cMy choice was that I decided to go with youth. And I stand by that because I think we\u2019ve got a a lot of good young players who are really going to benefit from that experience at the World Cup, and going forward to the 2027 World Cup.\u201d\nIt was reported during the campaign that Jones had an interview for the Japan head coach role but he denied that again on Tuesday, having previously also denied the story.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been speaking to anyone, mate,\u201d was all Jones would say on multiple reports of conversations with sources in Japanese rugby.\nHe said he understood why Australian fans were hurting.\n\u201cWe feel all the supporters hurt and really appreciate the great support we had in France and back in Australia for the team,\u201d said Jones.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cSometimes the change you have to have is uncomfortable. It is quite difficult. And sometimes you have to go through this to get into a better state and I believe that the problems we\u2019ve had particularly at the national team will put us in a better state going forward.\u201d\nJones clearly believes he is the right man to carry Australia on.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got the foresight to see where we need to go. I\u2019ve got the experience of being in difficult situations before,\u201d Jones said.\n\u201cThis is not an unusual situation. You\u2019ve got a team that was struggling for a period of time, you\u2019ve got underneath it a system that\u2019s not supporting it and at some stage you bottom out.\n\u201cThis is the opportunity now to change the team- as we\u2019ve started with picking younger players with bright futures \u2013 and then we\u2019ve got to look at the development system underneath as well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a simple equation that the Wallabies are bad. Let\u2019s be serious about this. The Wallabies are not where they need to be but underneath that we need to fix the system to go forward.

{"title":"World Series 2023 live score: Rangers vs. Diamondbacks updates, highlights, results from Game 4","context":"## World Series 2023 live score: Rangers vs. Diamondbacks updates, highlights, results from Game 4\n\nThe Rangers found themselves one strike away from a championship twice in 2011. They couldn't finish the job. On Wednesday night, they'll have a chance to avenge that painful finish.\nTexas found out before Tuesday's Game 4 that slugger Adolis Garcia's season was over, but a talented lineup didn't miss a beat. The Rangers erupted for five runs in the second inning and five more in the third, bludgeoning Arizona's bullpen to take a 10-0 lead in the blink of an eye.\nCorey Seager came through with his third home run of the series, while Marcus Semien drove in five of the Rangers' first 10 runs \u2014 including a three-run blast that put Texas up by double digits.\nFAGAN: Three things Diamondbacks need to flip script on World Series\nThe Diamondbacks have earned a reputation for not backing down, and to their credit, they didn't. Arizona scored six runs over the final two innings, putting together competitive at-bats despite the dramatic deficit and forcing the Rangers to go to closer Jose Leclerc for the final out.\nStill, it wasn't nearly enough. The Diamondbacks' best hope is that their late-game surge carries over to Game 5, where they will face elimination for the third time in this postseason.\nThe Rangers just need one more win to become World Series champions, and they will have the right man on the mound in Game 5 as Nathan Eovaldi makes his sixth start of the postseason. Zac Gallen, who was less than sharp in October but earned Cy Young consideration during the regular season, will start for the Diamondbacks with everything on the line for Arizona.\nMORE: How Bruce Bochy went from retirement to World Series in one year\nThe Sporting News tracked live scoring updates and highlights from Game 4 of the 2023 World Series between the Rangers and Diamondbacks.

Arizona has a little something brewing here.\n11:12 p.m. \u2014 Lawlar with a very professional plate appearance for a player who was just called up in September. He starts the inning with a walk.\n11:09 p.m. \u2014 It'll be rookie Jordan Lawlar facing Will Smith to lead off the inning.\n11:07 p.m. \u2014 Chris Stratton warmed up to start the inning, but Bruce Bochy is making a change after seeing Pavin Smith enter as a pinch-hitter.\n11:04 p.m. \u2014 Jung quickly grounds into an inning-ending double play. Now the Diamondbacks just need six runs in the bottom of the ninth to extend the game.\n11:02 p.m. \u2014 Saalfrank hits Carter, a call that is upheld after Torey Lovullo asked for a review.\n10:59 p.m. \u2014 After Garver strikes out, Andrew Saalfrank is coming in to face Evan Carter.\n10:56 p.m. \u2014 Seager leads off the ninth with a ground-rule double.\n10:54 p.m. \u2014 Thomas hits a bouncer that ends the inning.\n10:52 p.m. 3-RUN HOME RUN \u2014 Snakes alive?

That's where this game is right now.\nRangers 11, Diamondbacks 1\n10:29 p.m. HOME RUN \u2014 For the first time since the third inning, the Rangers have a run.

Gurriel grounds into an inning-ending double play to end that threat.\n10:07 p.m. \u2014 Walker and Pham put back-to-back singles on the board with one out.\n10:01 p.m. \u2014 Nelson strikes out Seager, whose World Series MVP case might be hurt by the fact he's hitting under .200 in the series. Onto the bottom of the sixth.\n9:59 p.m. \u2014 Ryne Nelson is doing his part, at least. He's retired the first eight hitters he's faced with Seager now coming to the plate.\n9:53 p.m. \u2014 The middle of the fifth inning is MLB's annual Stand Up to Cancer tribute. A fantastic moment at Chase Field.\nTonight, we come together to Stand Up To Cancer. pic.twitter.com\/uFwnMBu47t \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) November 1, 2023\n9:52 p.m. \u2014 Heaney is through five innings of one-run ball for the Rangers, who lead 10-1.\n9:51 p.m. \u2014 Marte is retired for the first time tonight on a ground ball that moves Perdomo over to second.\n9:49 p.m. \u2014 Perdomo works a one-out walk against Heaney, who's up to 76 pitches.\n9:44 p.m. \u2014 Make it 6-for-6 for Nelson, who has coasted through two scoreless innings. Let's see if Arizona can put any pressure at all on the Rangers.\n9:43 p.m. \u2014 Nelson gets the first two outs without incident. He's retired all five batters he's faced.\n9:40 p.m. \u2014 Fan on the field! At least there's some action.\n9:37 p.m. \u2014 Heaney retires Alek Thomas, so the Diamondbacks come away from that opportunity with only one run. They're going to need more.\nRangers 10, Diamondbacks 1\n9:35 p.m. SACRIFICE FLY \u2014 Gurriel hits one a long way to right field, but it's caught near the warning track. Still, it's a run.

The Diamondbacks have runners on second and third with nobody out.\n9:29 p.m. \u2014 Moreno walks to open the bottom of the fourth.\n9:27 p.m. \u2014 Nelson retires Carter and Jung, so it's a much-needed quick inning by Diamondbacks pitching. Now it's just up to Arizona's offense to put up 10 or so runs.\n9:24 p.m. \u2014 Ryne Nelson strikes out Garver to open the fourth.\n9:20 p.m. \u2014 Nathaniel Lowe makes the play to retire Carroll, and that will bring the Rangers back up to bat with a 10-0 lead.\n9:17 p.m. \u2014 At least Ketel Marte showed up for the Diamondbacks tonight. He's 2-2 after a double off of Heaney.\n9:16 p.m. \u2014 Perdomo grounds out up the middle for the second out of the inning.\n9:15 p.m. \u2014 Emmanuel Rivera opens the bottom of the third with a lineout.\nRangers 10, Diamondbacks 0\n9:09 p.m. 3-RUN HOME RUN \u2014 This is ugly, ugly, ugly for Arizona. Marcus Semien blasts a 3-run home run to put the Rangers up by double-digits, and an Arizona bullpen that has been so great in this postseason is getting bludgeoned.\nA 3-RUN HOMER FROM SEMIEN MAKES IT 10-0 @Rangers! \ud83d\ude31\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: FOX pic.twitter.com\/83qi1EGjO2 \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) November 1, 2023\nRangers 7, Diamondbacks 0\n9:08 p.m. 2-RUN DOUBLE \u2014 Who needs Adolis Garcia?

Christian Walker had a chance to turn two but couldn't hold onto the ball. The Rangers have the bases loaded with one out.\n8:59 p.m. \u2014 Lowe keeps the line moving and laces a single up the middle. The Rangers have two runners on with one out. This one could get even more out of hand for Arizona.

Leody Taveras has a two-out RBI opportunity.\n8:31 p.m. \u2014 Miguel Castro is in to face Heim with one out and Jung at second.\n8:29 p.m. \u2014 Mantiply quickly strikes out Lowe for the first out of the inning, and that will be the end of his day.\n8:27 p.m. \u2014 Keeping Mantiply in to face Josh Jung was not successful. Jung belts a double into the gap and gives Texas a leadoff runner in scoring position. Mantiply will stay in to face Nathaniel Lowe.\n8:25 p.m. \u2014 The Diamondbacks are sticking with Mantiply to start the second inning.\n8:23 p.m. \u2014 Heim nabs Marte on the stolen base attempt! That'll end the inning. A quick momentum shift back to the Rangers after the leadoff Marte single.\n8:21 p.m. \u2014 Another strikeout for Heaney, who gets Moreno.

Marcus Semien is ready. Game 4 of the World Series is underway with a strike.\n7:55 p.m. \u2014 Jon Rahm and Michael Phelps are among the stars in attendance at Chase Field.\n7:35 p.m. \u2014 For all of the Rangers' losses, a win tonight with Nathan Eovaldi and Jordan Montgomery in line to start the next two games would put Texas in a terrific position.\n7:18 p.m. \u2014 Max Scherzer is also off the World Series roster for Texas.

Make your prediction and bet here (selected territories)\nWhen was the first ODI Cricket Word Cup?\nEngland hosted the inaugural ODI World Cup back in 1975, and held the event the following three times too.\nInitially, the game was played in cricket whites and with a red ball instead of a white ball.\nEight teams were a part of that inaugural tournament \u2014 India, Pakistan, England, Australia, West Indies, New Zealand and a composite team from East Africa and Sri Lanka.\nCurrent cricketing powerhouse South Africa was banned at the time from international sport due to its policy of racial segregation under the Apartheid system, and thus did not take part in the first ODI World Cup.\nThe West Indies won the first tournament and defended the title in the second World Cup in 1979, while India's first taste of glory came when they clinched the trophy in 1983 by defeating the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.\nODI World Cup full list of winners and finals\nYear Host Winner Runner-up Result 1975 England West Indies Australia West Indies won by 17 runs 1979 England West Indies England West Indies won by 92 runs 1983 England India West Indies India won by 43 runs 1987 India & Pakistan Australia England Australia won by seven runs 1992 Australia & New Zealand Pakistan England Pakistan won by 22 runs 1996 Pakistan, India & Sri Lanka Sri Lanka Australia Sri Lanka won by seven wickets 1999 England Australia Pakistan Australia won by eight wickets 2003 South Africa Australia India Australia won by 125 runs 2007 West Indies Australia Sri Lanka Australia won by 53 runs (DLS) 2011 India, Sri Lanka & Bangladesh India Sri Lanka India won by six wickets 2015 Australia & New Zealand Australia New Zealand Australia won by seven wickets 2019 England & Wales England New Zealand England won on boundary count after a Super Over\nWho has won the most ODI Cricket World Cups?\nAustralia are the most successful nation in ODI World Cup history, with India and the West Indies chasing them.\nCountry World Cup titles Years won Australia 5 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015 India 2 1983, 2011 West Indies 2 1975, 1979 England 1 2019 Sri Lanka 1 1996 Pakistan 1 1992\nMORE: Complete ICC Cricket World Cup schedule and results from India\nA 50-over ODI Cricket World Cup\nThe 1987 tournament saw two prime changes in the way the ODI World Cups were organised \u2014 a shift of venue from England to the Indian subcontinent, and games being played in 50 overs instead of 60.\nThe change in the number of overs was attributed to shorter daylight hours in Asia in comparison to England.\nThe 1987 tournament also had a new winner in Australia, who went on to defeat England by seven runs.\nODI World Cup kits, white ball introduction\nHeld in Australia and New Zealand, the 1992 World Cup saw a number of landmark moments.\nThat tournament was the first in which teams wore coloured kits, while it also saw the introduction of the white ball, changes in fielding rules, day\/night matches and the inclusion of South Africa in the event for the first time following the end the Apartheid regime.\nAfter a slow and disappointing start to their year, Pakistan made an historic comeback in the tournament to eventually win the trophy by defeating England in the final.\nREAD: ICC sends 2023 World Cup trophy into space\nThe 1999 World Cup and a three-year gap\nThe 1996 tournament was jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka, and will go down in history as one of the most controversial episodes in the game.\nBoth the host teams met in the semi-finals at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. India's poor performance sparked an unruly crowd to protest against the home team and Sri Lanka was declared the winner by default, due to the halt in play.\nSri Lanka then went on to win the trophy that year, and they were back to try and defend it three years later in England, rather than the usual four-year cycle.\nFollowing the 1996 event the ICC opted to try and revamp the schedule, with three years between events rather than four.

{"title":"Strategizing for sustainable development","context":"## Strategizing for sustainable development\n\nPublic policies attempt to fulfill one or more of the following objectives: efficiency, equity, and stability. Efficiency and stability are necessary conditions for sustainable growth while equity helps make development inclusive.\nThis is the second article in our series following the 2nd SGV Tax Symposium, which focused on how a sustainable and effective tax ecosystem can advance the sustainability agenda for both the public and private sectors.\nIn this article, we will discuss the Philippine strategy for sustainable development.\nGROWTH THROUGH TRADE AND INVESTMENT\nThe Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028 aims for a deep economic and social transformation to reinvigorate job creation and accelerate poverty reduction by steering the economy back to a high-growth path. In this regard, two main performance indicators are identified and will be monitored by the National Government.\nThe first is for the country to graduate into upper middle-income class status within the term of the current administration. For this, the economy must grow its per capita income above the threshold set by the World Bank, which means a gross national income (GNI) per capita of at least $4,466. In 2022, the Philippines achieved a GNI per capita of $3,950.\nThe second is to lower the poverty level from 18.1% in 2021 to single digits by 2028 \u2014 the end of the term of the current administration. Both indicators require high growth rates. For the next year through 2028, the government pencils the growth rate between 6.5% and 8%.\nGrowth is expected to be investment-led with the implementation of structural changes such as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) law, which lowered the corporate income tax rate, and the amendments to the Public Service Act (PSA), Foreign Investment Act (FIA), and Retail Trade Liberalization Act (RTLA), which further liberalized the economy. The new legislation is expected to attract more local and foreign investment, especially in the liberalized sectors. For the energy sector in particular, amendments to the PSA are envisioned to help raise the capital needed to speed up the energy transition of the country to renewables.\nIn addition, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a trading bloc that encompasses the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ASEAN Plus One Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, is already in force for the Philippines, helping ease market access through trade and investment rules and supporting global and regional supply chains. The Philippines can potentially position itself as a regional manufacturing hub if the right incentives and policy measures are put in place to encourage local and foreign investors to participate. Together, trade and investment are expected to play an important role in attaining economic transformation, the second goal of the PDP.\nHUMAN CAPITAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nThe ability of people to take advantage of market opportunities arising from investment rests on human capital. To this end, the first goal of the PDP is social transformation which includes, among others, sustained expenditure on social services, mainly education, health, and social protection.\nThe first two goals of the PDP help attain the developmental objectives of efficiency and equity, which rest on the pillars of sustainability and resilience. The third fosters societal resilience: an enabling environment encompassing institutions, macroeconomic stability, and the physical and natural environment.\nInstitutions are vital to economic acceleration, which is why the government\u2019s steps to enhance the ease of doing business are most welcome. Infrastructure development also enables an economy to sustain higher levels of growth, which, in turn, catalyzes yet more investment. The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Act is up for the signature of President Marcos and, if approved, is expected to further enhance the business atmosphere in mobilizing private resources for infrastructure development.\nThe government aims to sustain its infrastructure program at 5-6% of GDP through 2028 amid a six-year medium-term fiscal framework. This plan gradually narrows the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, down from 7.3% in 2022, such that the debt-to-GDP ratio is reduced from nearly 61% in 2022 to a more sustainable level of at most 53% by 2028.\nDEBT MANAGEMENT\nThe National Government\u2019s debt was less than 40% before the pandemic struck. It expended much of its fiscal space combatting the pandemic, incurring debt and large budget deficits. While the current 61% debt-to-GDP ratio may be manageable for an emerging economy like the Philippines for some time, the country may not have the fiscal space to respond to another potential domestic or external shock. If the debt continues to rise more than the economy, risks will increase, and the government may \u201ccrowd out\u201d private investment as it competes with the private sector for funds to service its debt.\nThe planned fiscal consolidation entails harmonizing the revenue needs with the promotion of investment through the structure and administration of the reformed incentive system. The National Government plans to raise more revenue to finance the country\u2019s socio-economic needs, largely through a progressive and simplified tax system, more efficient and effective tax collection measures through digitalization and, to some extent, from policy measures such as value-added tax on digital service providers and excise tax on sweetened beverages and junk food.\nAchieving fiscal stability presupposes the sustainability of fiscal policy, and fiscal stability helps \u201ccrowd in\u201d private investment.\nPRICE STABILITY AND INFLATION\nIn his second State of the Nation Address (SONA), President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. singled out inflation as the country\u2019s most pressing problem. In the first nine months of 2023, inflation averaged 6.6% \u2014 far above the upper end of the target range of 2-4% set by the BSP. If left unchecked, inflation could undermine growth. Not only does this increase costs to organizations, but it also sets in motion second-round effects as workers start demanding higher wages, consequently increasing business costs and discouraging investments.\nInflation is partly driven by supply-side issues and the government is allocating more resources to the agriculture sector to boost production. Mr. Marcos also mentioned that the National Government had distributed 28,000 new tools and machinery to farmers. An additional 600 km of farm-to-market roads were laid down to support the 14 million hectares of farmland, enhancing farmer access to markets. In addition, he signed Executive Order No. 28 in May, forming the Inter-Agency Committee on Inflation and Market Outlook, which is tasked to keep inflation within government targets and boost the economy.\nENHANCING CLIMATE RESILIENCE\nWhile price stability and fiscal sustainability are important macroeconomic issues, environmental sustainability is increasingly gaining importance. Climate change uncertainties and challenges need to be managed and both the Philippine government and the private sector are hard-pressed to deliver their commitments to addressing them. Despite climate change risks, the Philippines has the opportunity to position itself as a prime destination of foreign investments against climate change or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments.\nThe government calls for embedding resilience, sustainability, and nature-based solutions in infrastructure planning and investment to enhance climate resilience. Likewise, investments in renewable energy are expected not only to enhance energy security but also reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nFrom an economic vantage point, GHG emissions are economic \u201cbads\u201d and are a cause of inefficiency as they get over-produced. Their effects, however, go beyond national borders, and while the Philippines contributes minimally to global GHG emissions, the World Risk Index 2022 report identifies the Philippines as the most disaster-prone country in the world.\nThe government envisions that by 2028: (1) Climate and disaster risk resilience of communities and institutions will increase (2) Ecosystem resilience will be enhanced, and (3) A low-carbon economy transition is enabled.\nTo ensure that these are realized, the government is set to safeguard cross-sectoral convergence and implement a comprehensive risk management approach to address the adverse consequences posed by climate change. It will also promote a green and blue economy coupled with improved governance to guarantee long-term climate and disaster resilience.\nBUILDING RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\nComing off from the pandemic and with the current global economic climate, it is opportune for the government to proactively drive for actionable policies and programs that focus on building the resiliency of the economy through sustainable development with greater emphasis given to addressing climate change.\nNavigating external and domestic economic headwinds will not be an easy feat for the administration, but the private sector will be an important catalyst for sustainable development. With the private sector sharing industry knowledge, resources and potentially even leading certain socio-economic programs and projects of the National Government, it is to be hoped that AmBisyon Natin 2040 of long and healthy lives for Filipinos that are strongly rooted, comfortable, and secure will be achieved.\nThis article is for general information only and is not a substitute for professional advice where the facts and circumstances warrant.

{"title":"Michigan State hires Jonathan Smith: Oregon State coach leaves alma mater to take over Spartans job","context":"## Michigan State hires Jonathan Smith: Oregon State coach leaves alma mater to take over Spartans job\n\nMichigan State has hired Jonathan Smith as its next football coach, the school announced on Saturday. Smith, 44, has spent the past six seasons as coach at Oregon State where he's guided the Beavers to 18 wins over the past two seasons, including a 10-3 mark and No. 17 finish in the AP Top 25 during a 2022 campaign that earned him Pac-12 Coach of the Year honors.\nSmith was among the initial pool of candidates linked to the Michigan State opening after the Spartans fired fourth-year coach Mel Tucker with cause midseason amid sexual harassment allegations. Smith later emerged as the leading candidate to replace Tucker during the final week of the regular season, which saw Oregon State suffer a 31-7 loss at rival Oregon.\n\"Jonathan has a proven track record of success, building the Oregon State program from the ground up by implementing a plan resulting in sustained historic success for the Beavers,\" said Michigan State athletic director Alan Haller in announcing the hire. \"He's been a part of championship staffs, coached in the College Football Playoff, and understands what's required to be successful at the highest level, learning from some of the game's most successful coaches.\n\"On the field, his teams are tough and physical, yet innovative. This year, Oregon State has controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, ranking among the nation's leaders in both rushing offense and rushing defense. He's shown not only the ability to recruit talented student-athletes who fit his system, but also to develop and maximize players once they're in the program.\"\nSmith, a former quarterback for the Beavers from 1998-2001, exits Oregon State with a 34-35 overall mark as coach, including a 1-1 record in bowl games, as he now joins the Big Ten coaching ranks.\n\"As I start this next chapter of my coaching career, I want to first thank all the players, coaches and colleagues I have worked with the last six years,\" Smith said in a statement posted to social media. \"I will cherish the memories and friendships. I also want to express my deepest gratitude to the people of OSU\/Corvallis for your support. When I first arrived as a freshman college student, I had no idea the opportunities and relationships this community would provide for me and my family. The collective impact you have made makes it impossible to thank everyone individually, but I am forever grateful.\"\nOregon State left in dust amid uncertain future\nAlthough Smith narrowly finished below. 500 in six seasons at the helm in Corvallis, Oregon, the Beavers made clear progress during the back half of his tenure. Smith guided Oregon State to seven victories in 2021 after the program went 9-22 during his first three years. The 2022 season, which marked the Beavers' first 10-win season since 2006 and highest AP Top 25 finish since 2000, resulted in a contract extension for Smith through February 2029 that bumped his annual salary to $4.85 million. Oregon State then started the 2023 season 8-2 before dropping back-to-back games against Washington and Oregon.\nEarlier in the week, Oregon State athletic director Scott Barnes called it the \"No. 1 priority\" to reach a contract extension with Smith as speculation of this move began to grow. In a statement Saturday after Smith's departure was finalized, Barnes thanked him for his efforts at Oregon State as the Beavers now embark on the search for Smith's replacement.\n\"Coach Smith and his staff worked tirelessly to rebuild the culture at Oregon State, both on the field and in the classroom,\" Barnes said. \"All of Beaver Nation should thank him for the lasting legacy he has left to his alma mater and wish him and his family nothing but the best moving forward.\"\nSmith held multiple assistant jobs from 2002-17 before returning to his alma mater as coach in 2018. Smith spent six seasons as an assistant under former college football coach Chris Petersen, first as Boise State's quarterbacks coach from 2012-13 and then as Washington's quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator from 2014-17. His time in Seattle included a Pac-12 title and College Football Playoff berth for Washington during the 2016 season.\nSmith's exit from Oregon State comes at a point where the Beavers face much uncertainty as the Pac-12 prepares to lose 10 of its 12 members ahead of the 2024 season. Oregon State and Washington State are the only schools in the conference that have not been picked up by other power leagues. Four Pac-12 members -- USC, UCLA, Washington and Oregon -- will join Smith in the Big Ten next fall.\nCan Smith turn the Michigan State program around?\nThe task now for Smith is revitalizing a Michigan State program that has struggled to field consistent success in recent seasons. After winning 10 or more games six times in a span of eight seasons under former coach Mark Dantonio from 2010-17, the Spartans have only won more than seven games in a season once since then, finishing 11-2 under Tucker's second year at the helm in 2021.\nWhat seemed to be a breakthrough season for Tucker in 2021 earned him a 10-year contract extension worth $95 million, but Tucker's remaining tenure in East Lansing was all downhill afterwards. Michigan State regressed to 5-7 in 2022 before allegations of sexual harassment surrounding Tucker against rape survivor and activist Brenda Tracy emerged just two games into the 2023 season. Tucker was promptly suspended before the school fired him with cause several weeks later. The Spartans went on to finish 4-8 with assistant Harlon Barnett serving as interim coach the rest of the way, ending the season with a 42-0 loss to Penn State on Friday.\nWhile Michigan State has found itself playing in a stacked Big Ten East division for roughly the last decade -- Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State have all been annual opponents -- that will change in Smith's debut season as the Big Ten expands and does away with divisions. Smith will also get the chance to face some familiar opponents from his time at Oregon State given that four Pac-12 schools are joining the conference. As far as the 2024 season is concerned on that front, Michigan State still faces Ohio State and Michigan (the Wolverines are a protected rival) but avoids Penn State. Oregon is the only newcomer it will face next fall, with the Spartans set to travel to Eugene, Oregon, in early October.\n\nThis article, authored by Dean Straka, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-11-25 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":411}

Talk about that whirlwind.\nKING: We started the WTA four days before Wimbledon. I won all three titles at Wimbledon, which for me was a big deal. Then equal prize money came into being, it started in 1972 with us saying we\u2019re not coming back (to the U.S. Open in 1973). Then King-Riggs. That\u2019s all in 3 months. I can appreciate it since being away from it so long. How the heck did we do that?\nYou\u2019ve said the King-Riggs match was about social change, women standing up for themselves in all areas.\nIt was really about men, too. Because men started to shift a little. Obama was 12 years old when he saw the King-Riggs match. He said it affected him a lot. Guys are much better thinking about their daughters than they used to be. All these things add up.\nYou\u2019re part of ownership groups for pro sports. How did you get involved in women\u2019s pro hockey, which will have teams in Boston, New York, Minnesota, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal?\nThe PWHL, it\u2019s really exciting. It took five years. Plus, it took all those years of the other leagues, everyone trying. (U.S. Olympic gold medalist) Kendall Coyne said, \u2018can you help us?\u2019 We need to have a league where the very best players will play. We went to Toronto and I did an opening speech about trailblazers. It was amazing because the families were crying, the players were crying, they said \u2018we\u2019ve never been treated like this, it\u2019s amazing, we feel like pros for the first time.\u2019 There were a lot of little kids there. Kids are going to have an amazing opportunity that the generations before them never had. All three of their networks had it on. It\u2019s a religion up there.\nHow is investment in women\u2019s sports changing?\nI\u2019m asking CEOs and everyone now \u2014 \u2018do you invest as much in women as you do in men?\u2019 Then it usually gets quiet. But I must say it\u2019s better than it used to be. We\u2019re really lucky to be with this investment group. The male allies we\u2019ve had through the years have made such a difference. They have the money and the power. But we\u2019re getting there, getting more and more women investors, particularly in soccer. Women\u2019s sports, we\u2019ve all been fighting for it.\nWhat would you like to see in the future for women\u2019s sports?\nMore. And make sure we get girls early in life into sports. It\u2019s really about the health issue, more than anything. More jobs, more everything. Women of color and diversity is really important.\nWe only get 5% of the media. That\u2019s where the money is. People always say, \u2018why doesn\u2019t the WTA have as much money as the ATP?\u2019 I\u2019m like, really?

{"title":"Israel's prince of public diplomacy","context":"## Israel's prince of public diplomacy\n\nAs a Jewish kid born and raised in London to parents who had moved there from Israel, Eylon Levy dreamed about serving as a spokesperson for the State of Israel. He would sit and watch the then Israeli ambassador to the UK Mark Regev on television and say to himself, \"That's what I want to do when I grow up.\"\nToday, aged 32, that is exactly what he is doing - battling day and night on screens to make the world acknowledge the atrocities and the reality forced on Israel since October 7, as a government spokesperson to the international media at the National Public Diplomacy Directorate in the Prime Minister's Office.\nHe tells \"Globes,\" \"Perhaps you won't believe it but it has always been my dream to act as a spokesperson for the state. It's a shame that it's in such painful circumstances. The legendary Mark Regev and myself have been working shifts on the TV channels worldwide and I remember how I watched him as a kid in London and wanted to do what he is doing.\"\nBack in October few people had heard of Levy. But now sitting in a caf\u00e9 in the Azrieli Mall in Tel Aviv to be interviewed by \"Globes,\" passersby clearly recognize him and some even stop to take a selfie with him.\nTo filter out the bullshit\nIn recent weeks, interviews with Levy have gained massive exposure worldwide and the Israeli public has embraced the eloquent and quick-witted spokesperson who has been articulating Israel's point of view so admirably, with his English accent. With degrees from both Oxford and Cambridge, Levy received the greatest exposure in an interview with UK Sky News presenter Kay Burley, who asked him whether the fact that Israel is willing to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for 50 Israeli hostages indicates that Israel thinks that Palestinian lives are worth less.\nLevy's spontaneous, shocked response saw his eyes open wide with surprise and his eyebrows shoot up. But within a second he had regained his composure and explained that Israel would release one Palestinian for each Jewish hostage if it could. \"We did not choose to release these prisoners who have blood on their hands. That's a disgusting accusation.\"\nThe strange question aroused anger and criticism worldwide but Kate Burley did not apologize and even justified her question on X (formerly Twitter) by saying that interviewers sometimes present one side of an argument so that those being interviewed can refute it. She claimed that she was presenting a controversial opinion that she had heard to allow the interviewee to respond.\nLevy does not accept this explanation. \"It's true that the role of the media is to challenge speakers with controversial opinions but it is also to filter out the bullshit and to know when you have been told nonsense that requires no further comment,\" he says.\nLevy posted the clip from the interview on his Twitter account and it received 16 million views and 15,000 shares (just from the Tweet). His number of followers has soared from 24,000 before the war to 140,000 after the Sky News interview. At the same time his look of astonishment and raised eyebrows have become a popular meme and WhatsApp sticker. \"If you would have told me several weeks ago that people would make memes of my face I wouldn't have believed it. But joking aside, we are here to explain the story of Israel abroad, if along the way there are amusing moments that allow people to enjoy a funny moment amid all the darkness and gloom we are experiencing, then let the joke be on me.\"\nAre you are asked many questions that smack of antisemitism, or lack of understanding and support for Israel's position?\nHow long have you got? I was asked by the BBC in a radio interview whether there is CCTV evidence that the hostages are in Shifa Hospital and what medical treatment were they receiving. I was asked by Sky News about why Yahya Sinwar was releasing hostages, even though Israel is bombing Gaza and I had to explain that it was because Israel is bombing Gaza.\n\"I was asked twice, in Ireland and by the Voice of America, why Hamas had been begging for five weeks to return hostages and we were only now bowing to US pressure to take back our children. I was interviewed by Piers Morgan in London who is very confrontational, who spoke to me about pictures from Gaza and said 'this the most shocking thing I have ever seen.' And I told him Piers, 'the most shocking thing we have seen in our lives was the slaughter on October 7.' Then he answered 'you are right.'\"\nFrom questions like these, do you get the feeling that everyone in the world hates us and they are all anti-Semites?\n\"It's not true that everyone hates us and they are all anti-Semites. We enjoy a great deal of support in the world. People understand that what happened on October 7 crossed a line with atrocities that cannot be repeated and for which there can be no excuse. This is what gives us legitimacy in this war against Hamas and the understanding that it not possible not to respond to this.\"\nWhy is it so hard for the world to understand this point of view?\n\"We are faced with difficult images coming out of Gaza. Israeli TV does not show what viewers abroad see of the destruction as a result of the military campaign to destroy the terrorist infrastructure built beneath houses, hospitals, mosques and schools. The world sees these pictures and wants to understand why we are doing this to civilians in Gaza. We are asked for how long? What's the limit? And we have to explain things that to Israelis sound self-evident, but in the world to those who do not live in our reality, they are incomprehensible. We must explain that this is a war imposed by Hamas through the most terrible massacre since the Holocaust, and it is a war that we must win because Hamas has repeated that it wants to carry out more October 7s until it murders every man, woman and child in our country.\"\nDo the explanations produce greater acceptance?\n\"Yes. There is understanding that we must end this war by destroying the capabilities of Hamas, otherwise we will be in the same situation in another six months. This is something I explain a lot to the Irish, for example. The Irish have been pressing for a ceasefire for a long time and I explain to them that if we had taken their advice and stopped firing then little Emily Hand would still be in captivity, and if we take their advice now to agree to a ceasefire then Hamas will commit more atrocities, because it will feel empowered and it will come out of this war with a feeling that the world has its back.\n\"We are being asked difficult questions about the dead on the other side and we must remind them that everyone who was killed in the Gaza Strip over the last month would be alive today if Hamas had not started the atrocities on October 7, and then decided to fight in populated areas, while preventing people from leaving despite all of Israel's efforts for over a month to evacuate civilians from the battle zones.\"\nLies continue to echo\nIn recent weeks Levy, and all Israel's spokespeople and volunteers in the National Public Diplomacy Directorate, headed by Moshe Aviv, have been working around the clock. \"We try to be available 24\/7. Last Friday I was interviewed at six in the morning and I finished with a CNN interview the following morning at 2am. There was a Saturday when I did four interviews with the BBC and it's not just me. Mark Regev is doing interviews at all hours of the night as well as Tal Heinrich in the US who is being interviewed non-stop in prime time. I am part of an amazing team of professionals.\n\"The work is being done in collaboration with Israel Police, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the IDF Spokesperson, the Israel prisons Service, the Shin Bet, the National Security Council and the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, which is responsible for producing items for digital channels. It's amazing to see every day when we all assess the situation, how all these bodies put their egos aside and I'm proud to be a part of it. If any channel wants an official spokesperson for the Israeli government, then we will be there because we cannot abandon the battlefield.\"\nThe world does not make life easy for Israel's spokespeople, to say the least, compared with the ease with which the Hamas narrative is adopted. \"I remember an interview the day after the bluff about the Al-Ahli hospital, which the Palestinians claimed had been hit by an Israeli missile, killing 800 civilians, but in the end it turned out that it was actually by a splinter group of Islamic Jihad, and that no hospital was destroyed and certainly not 800 people were killed. I explained to them in Sky News that Hamas lies and makes up numbers and the reporter asks me almost speechless with surprise, if I doubt Hamas' numbers.\"\nLevy describes these moments as intensely frustrating. He recounts, \"In a BBC interview, the interviewer told me 'Hamas denies what you are saying,' and you see the frustration on my face when I tell her that of course Hamas denies this. Hamas denies that it is even holding hostages. Hamas massacres, beheads, rapes, burns families, and then, day and night, denies that it did this.\n\"Some journalists around world see that Hamas continues to lie about the biggest things when the whole truth is in front of everyone's eyes, and they continue to echo the lies. This is not only a kinetic war in Gaza, it is also an information war.\"\nTwo months now, Levy has been fighting in this arena with the tools at his disposal. \"We are fighting to make it clear to the world that the information coming out of Gaza comes either directly from Hamas or from independent reporters and photographers that are part of the system in Gaza. Everyone knows that even if they are not affiliated with Hamas, they are not free to present the full truth, because they are not allowed to. There is not a single photo of a terrorist, there is not a single photo of a missile being launched from a densely populated area, from a mosque or a school, not even a single photo from the Hamas tunnels under Shifa. Why? Because these reporters, even if they are not explicitly on the side of Hamas, operate under a dictatorial regime and cannot provide the information even if they wanted to. And it is very important to continue reminding the world how much the information that reaches them is biased and does not reflect reality.\"\nDespite all this, Levy feels he must stress that not everyone is against us. \"I don't want to give the impression that all the interviewers are hostile and every question is delusional. Absolutely not. I have many interviews with reporters who understand what is happening here and simply want to get information and hear the Israeli side, which is completely legitimate.\"\nGeorge Galloway got up and walked out\nLevy was born and raised in England and attended a private school in North London in an area with a large Jewish population. He has always taken an interest in news and current affairs and a student was active in the world of debating, including tournaments. \"It would not be an exaggeration to say that I would sit in the bath reading The Economist. Arguing and opposing incorrect positions has always been one of my great hobbies. Alongside this, I grew up with a strong awareness of the importance of the State of Israel and its historical role in the history of our people. I have often had to explain Israel over the years.\"\nThe UK is currently in the headlines over anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations and antisemitism. Did you encounter antisemitism in your childhood there?\n\"I did not personally experience antisemitism but I was exposed to it during debates and every time there was a round of fighting I found myself defending Israel's position.\"\nOne of the most significant occasions on which Levy was defending Israel was in 2013, when he was an undergraduate at the University of Oxford, and was conducting a debate with British MP George Galloway on his remarks about Israel. \"Galloway is known as a notorious Israel hater. He arrived an hour late gave his crazy speech and sat down and then I spoke. In the middle of the speech I said 'we' referring to the State of Israel, and he stood up and asked me 'what do you mean we? Are you Israeli? When I answered yes, he said 'I don't do debates with Israelis. Goodbye' and left. It was filmed and the next morning all the UK media reported on it. It even made it into a cartoon in \"The Times.\"\nThat was a moment that reverberates for Levy when he sees what is currently happening in universities around the world. \"I look at what is happening on campuses around the world and tear my hair out, because I was there 10 years ago and tried to warn about the connection between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, how deep-rooted the hatred against Israel actually is and how many Jews are harmed by this blind hatred.\"\nIn 2014, on completing his master's degree in international relations at the University of Cambridge, Levy found himself at the crossroads that led him to Israel: \"One option was to study law and work as a lawyer in London, and the other option was to go on a Zionist adventure. That summer I was on the March of the Living and I remember myself standing wrapped in a flag and crying, realizing that a decision had been made. I decided that I was immigrating to Israel and enlisting in the army at the age of 23.\"\nThe decision was made just as Operation Protective Edge (2014) began. \"I wanted to enlist to help in the war. It was the scariest experience in my life. I remember a child who looked out the window and said, 'Dad, I think I saw a missile.'\"\nWhen I actually immigrated to Israel, the taxi driver told me that the war had finished six months previously. Even so I reported the next day to the IDF Induction Center in Tel Hashomer.\"\nLevy served in the command center of the IDF coordinator of activities in the administered territories, which is responsible for civil policies and security coordination with the Israeli government in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip. After his army service he worked as a newsreader for the English news on the Israel Broadcasting Authority and then as a newsreader for i24News. He served as foreign media advisor for President Isaac Herzog for two years until May 2023 and has translated some 30 books from Hebrew to English. He was also active in the protests against the government's judicial reform.\nSo how does that all fit together - one day you are at a demonstration against the government and the next day you are its spokesperson?\n\"Like many, I participated in the protests against the reform. It's no secret. There was Israel before October 7 and there is Israel after. Nothing will return to what it was before. There is now only one task: to win the war, and for that we must put the wars of the Jews aside and unite.\"\nThis is also the message with which Levy wants to conclude the interview. \"It's amazing to see how Israeli society has come to its senses after the traumas. One of our strengths is that everyone works for everyone,\" he says proudly. \"When I left synagogue on Yom Kippur after the concluding services and I saw what was happening in Dizengoff Square with all the shoving and the shouting, I found myself on the verge of tears. Today I miss the days when we were on the verge of a civil war because of a gender partition (in Dizengoff Square).\"\n\"It's so ridiculous what we argued about and what we pulled our hair out over for before October 7, a date that reminds us all of the big picture, why we are here, why we owe each other and in the end also love each other. It's sad that it took such a tragedy to remind us of the importance of unity in the nation, but we must maintain it.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on December 3, 2023.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023.\n\nThis article, authored by Ela Levi-Weinreb, was published by Globes English | Israel Business Arena on 2023-12-03 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":413}
{"title":"Damien Penaud leads historic rout of Italy as France confirm progress in style","context":"## Damien Penaud leads historic rout of Italy as France confirm progress in style\n\nEt voil\u00e0. France are through to the quarter-finals after the tournament\u2019s latest mismatch against a demoralised Italy. The unthinkable outcome \u2013 a pool-stage exit for Fabien Galthi\u00e9\u2019s side \u2013 had remained a possibility, but was never on the cards from the moment Damian Penaud scored the first of eight French tries in the second minute. France have beaten Italy 14 times consecutively, a run stretching back to 2014.\nIf the predatory Penaud\u2019s progress is a marker of France\u2019s hopes, their fellow title contenders should be worried. The wing has scored in seven straight matches and 14 times this year. Two tries here took him to second overall in their men\u2019s try-scorers\u2019 chart, with 35, three behind Serge Blanco. As a whole, the French machine is tuning up satisfactorily with top spot in Pool A secured. A potential last-eight collision with Ireland or South Africa, or indeed Scotland, will be a monumental affair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to congratulate Damian for his attacking performance,\u201d Galthi\u00e9 said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also easy when you have a team like that working for you. Players that become great are served by their teams; there\u2019s always a balance.\u201d The former France scrum-half added: \u201cWe\u2019re happy to qualify \u2026 We\u2019ll recuperate together, celebrate qualification, then turn to the quarter-final. For us, after a World Cup final against New Zealand [on opening night], our game next Sunday will be a second final.\u201d\nFor Kieran Crowley, Galthi\u00e9\u2019s opposite number, his Italy tenure ends in profound disappointment, although crushing defeats by the All Blacks and now the hosts are offset by victories against Namibia and Uruguay.\n\u201cI\u2019ve said before, I\u2019d like to take this team forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the next World Cup is our cycle \u2026 we\u2019ll get to the next tournament, and a lot of these players will have 60, 70 caps. But that wasn\u2019t my decision.\n\u201cWhat needs to happen is that these players need to be treated with a bit of respect off the field \u2026 They [the Italian Rugby Federation] need to get some of that stuff sorted. Quite honestly, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want to be involved unless that gets sorted. I respect these guys, these players and staff. They\u2019ve gone way beyond \u2026 and yet people will judge us on these last two games. It\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\nDamaging setbacks have arrived with regularity for France, most notably Antoine Dupont\u2019s fractured cheekbone. But the prop Cyril Baille had returned from injury in the thrashing of Namibia, along with the estimable Jonathan Danty in midfield, and both started against Italy.\nAny hint of home nerves was calmed by the try for Penaud that stemmed from the first attack. Uini Atonio and Thibaud Flament were both involved, busting through tackles and creating a huge overlap for Penaud. Thomas Ramos belted over a penalty and the pressure on Italy continued unabated, Penaud fluffing a grubber kick with another big overlap created.\nThe hosts quickly came again, and Penaud got his kick right this time, picking out Louis Bielle-Biarrey with a chip that the wing converted impeccably. Ramos flopped over after another fluent exchange with Ga\u00ebl Fickou.\nLouis Bielle-Biarrey scores France\u2019s try to again underline his potential. Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat\/AFP\/Getty Images\nAt 24-0 Italy temporarily steadied a listing ship. After Ange Capuozzo was removed for a head injury assessment, Simone Ferrari powered over, but the television match official spotted a high hit by Ferrari on Maxime Lucu and the try was chalked off. Almost immediately, Penaud went over at the other end to secure a bonus point after fielding Matthieu Jalibert\u2019s cross-kick. It was 31-0 at half-time.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Breakdown Free weekly newsletter The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The important thing is that at the end of the game, we end up ahead. We are not here to show off, or to look good. We\u2019re here to win.\u201d He added that he expects the injured Dupont and Julien Marchand to play during the knockout stages.\nWhen flanker Charles Ollivon \u2013 sitting alongside his head coach \u2013 was asked about next Sunday\u2019s opponents, Galthi\u00e9 interjected. \u201cWe can\u2019t know our opponent. Have you played tomorrow\u2019s game already? There is a Scotland v Ireland game that may modify the quarter-finals. If you are talking about our quarter-final opponents, it\u2019s quite simple.

{"title":"A timeline of Sam Altman\u2019s firing from OpenAI \u2014 and the fallout","context":"## A timeline of Sam Altman\u2019s firing from OpenAI \u2014 and the fallout\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events late Friday, ex-Y Combinator president Sam Altman was fired as CEO of AI startup OpenAI, the company behind viral AI hits like ChatGPT, GPT-4 and DALL-E 3, by OpenAI\u2019s board of directors. Then, the company\u2019s longtime president and co-founder, Greg Brockman, resigned \u2014 as did three senior OpenAI researchers. And the fallout continues.\nTip TechCrunch\nDo you work at OpenAI and know more about Sam Altman\u2019s departure?\nDo you work at OpenAI and know more about Sam Altman\u2019s departure? Get in touch with TechCrunch\nIt\u2019s a fast-moving situation that we\u2019re still trying to get to the bottom of. No doubt more will become clear as time goes on. To make it easier to follow all that\u2019s happened in the meantime, though, we\u2019ve put together a timeline; we\u2019ll do our best to keep it current.\nTimeline of Sam Altman\u2019s firing from OpenAI\nNovember 29\nMicrosoft gains a board observer\nMicrosoft will gain representation on the new initial board of directors in the form of a non-voting observer, OpenAI announced. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear who this observer might be \u2014 only that they won\u2019t have an official vote in board business.\nNovember 21\nSam Altman, OpenAI reach agreement on return as CEO and \u2018initial\u2019 new board\nIn a sudden late announcement, OpenAI revealed that it and Altman \u201chave reached an agreement in principle\u201d for him to return as the company\u2019s CEO. In addition to Altman\u2019s return, its new \u201cinitial\u201d board will include former Salesforce chief executive Bret Taylor, former US Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers and Quora founder Adam D\u2019Angelo.\nWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo. We are collaborating to figure out the details. Thank you so much for your patience through this. \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) November 22, 2023\nAltman also posted about the new deal, giving some insight into the roller coaster that we\u2019ve all been riding since his firing was revealed Friday. In his words, his decision to join Microsoft on Sunday \u201cwas the best path for me and the team.\u201d Since then, the new board\u2019s composition and Microsoft\u2019s support appear to have been enough to bring him back to the AI company he co-founded.\nAltman and board in talks\nOpenAI\u2019s board of directors is reportedly in talks with Sam Altman, ex-Y Combinator president and an OpenAI co-founder, to return to OpenAI as CEO as soon as this week. That\u2019s according to Bloomberg, which in a brief \u2014 citing sources close to the matter \u2014 said that discussions are happening between Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo, one current member of the OpenAI board, and Altman \u2014 and possibly other board members as well.\nBoard tensions boil over\nThe New York Times reports that, before his ousting, Sam Altman made a move to push out board member Helen Toner because he thought a paper she had co-written was overly critical of OpenAI. That, among other issues, led to OpenAI\u2019s current predicament. Speaking of, The Times indicates that negotiations to hire Altman back continue \u2014 but that one major sticking point remaining is \u201cguardrails\u201d meant to improve Altman\u2019s communication with the board.\n\u2014\nNovember 20\nAltman joins Microsoft\nSam Altman, Greg Brockman and colleagues announce that they\u2019ll join Microsoft to lead a new AI research team. Nadella leaves the door open to other OpenAI staffers, saying that they\u2019ll be given the resources they need should they choose to join.\nSutskever\u2019s mea culpa\nSutskever publishes a post on X suggesting that he regrets his decision to remove Altman and that he\u2019ll do everything in his power to reinstate Altman as CEO.\nI deeply regret my participation in the board's actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company. \u2014 Ilya Sutskever (@ilyasut) November 20, 2023\nEmployees threaten to resign\nNearly 500 of OpenAI\u2019s roughly 770 employees \u2014 including, remarkably, Sutskever \u2014 publish a letter saying that they might quit unless the startup\u2019s board resigns and reappoints the ousted Altman. Later Monday, that number climbed to over 650.\nAltman and Brockman considering return\nAs reported by The Verge, Altman\u2019s move to Microsoft isn\u2019t a done deal \u2014 and both Altman and Brockman are still open to returning to OpenAI. That is, if the remaining board members who initially fired him step aside.\nOpenAI board considers merger\nOpenAI\u2019s board of directors approached Dario Amodei, the co-founder and CEO of rival large-language model developer Anthropic, about a potential merger of the two companies, The Information reports. The approach was part of an effort by OpenAI to persuade Amodei to replace Altman as CEO \u2014 but Amodei quickly turned down the CEO offer.\n\u2014\nNovember 19\nAltman to meet at OpenAI HQ\nAccording to The Information, Altman is expected to meet at OpenAI\u2019s San Francisco headquarters as executives at OpenAI push to have him reinstated as CEO. Brockman was invited to join \u2014 but it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll take execs up on that invitation.\nBoard negotiations hit a snag\nBloomberg reports that Lightcap and Murati, among others, are pushing the board to reinstate Altman. But unsurprisingly, the directors are resisting. As of midday Sunday, the board hadn\u2019t resigned out of concern over who could replace them, and were vetting candidates. One possible new addition could be Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor.\nAltman out, Shear in\nAltman won\u2019t be returning as CEO, according to a report in The Information citing an internal memo sent by Sutskever. As the search for a new permanent CEO continues, OpenAI has appointed Emmett Shear, the co-founder of video streaming site Twitch, as interim CEO \u2014 replacing Murati.\n\u2014\nNovember 18\n\u201cNot \u2026 in response to malfeasance\u201d\nIn an internal memo obtained by Axios sent Saturday morning, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap said yesterday\u2019s announcement \u201ctook [the management team] by surprise\u201d and that management had had \u201cmultiple conversations with the board to try to better understand the reasons and process behind their decision.\u201d Discussions were ongoing as of Saturday morning, per the memo.\n\u201cWe can say definitively that the board\u2019s decision was not made in response to malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security\/privacy practices,\u201d Lightcap added. \u201cThis was a breakdown in communication between Sam and the board \u2026 We still share your concerns about how the process has been handled, are working to resolve the situation, and will provide updates as we\u2019re able.\u201d\nOpenAI\u2019s funding in jeopardy\nThe planned sale of OpenAI employee shares that would value the startup at about $86 billion could be in jeopardy. The Information, speaking to three sources formerly with the company, reports that they no longer expect the sale \u2014 led by Thrive Capital \u2014 to happen, or, if it does, to come with a lesser valuation because of the recent turn of events.\nAltman planning new venture\nAltman has been telling investors that he\u2019s planning to launch a new venture, according to The Information. Brockman is expected to join the effort \u2014 whatever form it takes. (Possibly an AI chip startup.)\ni love you all. today was a weird experience in many ways. but one unexpected one is that it has been sorta like reading your own eulogy while you\u2019re still alive. the outpouring of love is awesome. one takeaway: go tell your friends how great you think they are. \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 18, 2023\nInvestors pushing for Altman\u2019s return\nInvestors \u2014 furious at the turn of events \u2014 are reportedly exerting pressure on OpenAI\u2019s board to reinstate Altman, going so far as to recruit Microsoft. Nadella is said to be sympathetic.\nBoard agrees to reverse course \u2014 in principle\nThe Verge reports that the board agreed in principle to resign and to allow Altman and Brockman to return. It waffled, however, missing a deadline yesterday by which many OpenAI staffers were set to leave the company. Altman is said to be ambivalent about coming back and asking for \u201csignificant\u201d governance changes.\n\u2014\nNovember 17\nBrockman demoted\nBrockman says he got a text from Sutskever shortly after noon on Friday asking for a quick call. After sending a Google Meet link, Brockman was told that he was being removed from the board as chairman \u201cbut was vital to the company and would retain his role\u201d as president, and that Altman had been fired.\nAltman\u2019s firing publicly announced\nOpenAI published a post on its blog announcing the executive shake-up. The company\u2019s management team was aware shortly after.\ni loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what\u2019s next later. \ud83e\udee1 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 17, 2023\nAll-hands meeting\nOpenAI held an all-hands meeting Friday afternoon during which Sutskever defended Altman\u2019s ouster. He dismissed suggestions that pushing Altman out amounted to a \u201chostile takeover,\u201d and claimed that it was necessary to protect OpenAI\u2019s mission of \u201cmaking AI beneficial to humanity.\u201d\nMicrosoft releases a statement\nSatya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, a major investor in \u2014 and partner with \u2014 OpenAI, published a statement about Altman\u2019s firing:\n\u201cAs you saw at Microsoft Ignite this week, we\u2019re continuing to rapidly innovate for this era of AI, with over 100 announcements across the full tech stack from AI systems, models and tools in Azure, to Copilot. Most importantly, we\u2019re committed to delivering all of this to our customers while building for the future.

{"title":"Amidst Managerial Shake-Ups, These 5 MLB Teams Are Looking for a New Leader: Who Are the Top Candidates?","context":"## Amidst Managerial Shake-Ups, These 5 MLB Teams Are Looking for a New Leader: Who Are the Top Candidates?\n\n2023 has been a topsy-turvy year for many teams. While some have outshone others, these 5 teams are at a crossroads, with a common stifling problem. Amid the heavy restructuring that many of the MLB teams have seen of late, there are pentagonal vacancies for managers. The New York Mets, the Los Angeles Angels, the Houston Astros, the Cleveland Guardians, and the San Diego Padres are in dire need of filling up the managerial position as the year ends.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nWhile some team representatives skim through names within the MLB world, some hope to look for an outside hire. It could be a risky state for all of them. Nevertheless, there are many possibilities and roadblocks one might encounter. Be it budgetary issues, past performance, or availability of candidates, these teams have not had success in putting a pin on one candidate. That said, the skipper market is abuzz!\nStarting With The Los Angeles Angels\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nAfter Joe Maddon was relieved of his managerial duties, Phil Nevin signed up as the interim manager for the remaining 106 games of 2022. Post that, he went on to sign a one-year contract to manage the Angels in 2023, and the interim tag was lifted. Nevin\u2019s 2024 club option was rejected by the Halos, who underwent partial two seasons of 119-149 (.444) play under his supervision. Since this was a non-negotiable, the seat stands vacant.\nThe biggest challenge in this scenario is that the Angels star, Shohei Ohtani is yet to reveal which team he would be joining. In case the Angels re-sign the two-way phenom, the manager would get to head the roster with the 2021 MVP and Mike Trout. A once in a lifetime opportunity. On the flip side, if they lose Ohtani, the roster would need a solid revamp. Not to mention the Angles are infamous for their below-par farm system and playoff drought spanning 9 seasons.\nWith that out in the open, what are the possible options for the Halos? Ray Montgomery could be an option, considering that he began his tenure with the Angels. Walt Weiss could potentially be a decent fit, too. Weiss has been a part of a successful team in the Atlanta Braves recently, having been their bench coach since before the 2018 season. Additionally, among other options are Ron Washington and Clayton McCullough. Though these options are open, no solid information has been revealed yet as to who would fill up the position.\nMoving On To The Houston Astros\nAfter his fourth season with the Astros and his 26th big league managerial season, Dusty Baker announced his retirement last week. Houston won the 2022 World Series and two pennants while the 74-year-old was in charge. Despite the starry possibilities of winning, the Texas Rangers defeated the Astros in the ALCS 2023.\nWith that seat now waiting to be warmed up, the future manager would manage a seasoned roster that appears ready to make another push at winning a World Series after winning six of the previous seven AL West championships. However, given Luis Garcia\u2019s Tommy John surgery and Lance McCullers Jr.\u2019s forearm surgery, the starting pitchers are expected to be shaky.\nThat said, there are some obvious options available to replace Dusty. One of the most sensible picks for a smooth transition would be Joe Espada, age 48. Since 2018, he has been the bench coach for the Astros. Baker relied on him in the dugout throughout his productive tenure as manager of Houston.\nApart from him, Buck Showalter, former New York Mets manager, Don Mattingly, Toronto Blue Jays bench coach, and A. J. Hinch, Detroit Tigers manager could be other possibilities.\nNext Up Is Cleveland Guardians\nFollowing an 11-year tenure with Cleveland that included leading the team to a 921-757 record (.549), six playoff trips, and the 2016 AL pennant, Terry Francona announced his resignation. The record made him the winningest manager in franchise history. He had managed the Guardians till the conclusion of the 2023 season, but now, owing to health concerns, he decides to put his wellbeing first.\nSince Cleveland usually has one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, the team\u2019s lineup won\u2019t be receiving a lot of outside reinforcement. It is clear that the Guardians are not keen on getting someone from within MLB; they are open to outside hires as well. As long as the new candidate can follow Terry\u2019s principles.\nOne applicant slated for an interview was Craig Albernaz. He is the catching and bullpen coach for the San Francisco Giants, according to Paul Hoynes of Cleveland.com. Despite lacking Major League managerial experience, the 40-year-old has led two championship-winning Tampa Bay Rays teams. Another likely candidate could be Carlos Mendoza, who is the bench coach for the New York Yankees. Though he too lacks managerial experience in MLB, the 43-year-old is familiar with the Yankees system, suiting well for Cleveland.\nSpeaking Of NY, The New York Mets Are On The Lookout\nIn his first season as manager, Buck Showalter guided the Mets to a 101-61 record. With that, he earned him the 2022 NL Manager of the Year Award. However, despite having baseball\u2019s largest budget, the Mets ended their 2023 with a disastrous 75-87. Under the new president of baseball operations David Stearns, the organization is taking a fresh approach. The man who described 2023 as \u201cthe roller coaster of disappointment and hope\u201d presiding over the Mets views his limited options.\nGabe Kapler made the exit three days before the San Francisco Giants season\u2019s conclusion; he could post as a suited candidate. Another likely possibility would be Craig Counsell, who is nearing the end of his contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. Counsell is the guy to watch out for this summer because of his excellent relationship with David Stearns. This newest president of baseball operations for the Mets is a former Brewer himself.\nThe Fifth Team In The List Is San Diego Padres\nBob Melvin was said to be returning to the Padres as manager, despite the team\u2019s 82-80 record and 2023 postseason absence. But in a turn of events, the San Francisco Giants hired Melvin when San Diego gave permission to interview him for SanFran\u2019s managerial vacancy.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nNow, the Padres\u2019 vacant position is linking to former Cardinals manager Mike Shildt multiple times. Bob Nightengale of USA Today Sports reports that Shildt is the front-runner to take over. \u201cThe Padres will be hiring their sixth manager in just 10 years under (general manager) A. J. Preller. Former St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Shildt is the favorite while associate manager Ryan Flaherty is getting strong consideration,\u201d Nightengale said. With that, one has to wait and watch who serves as the best fit.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nWith the facts broken down, it is a matter of time that the teams narrow down their best options.

{"title":"Teenage Engineering's K.O. II sampler proves the company can do cost-friendly cool","context":"## Teenage Engineering's K.O. II sampler proves the company can do cost-friendly cool\n\nThere's something of a theme running through Teenage Engineering's recent products. That theme is you need more money. The Field range represents the Swedish company\u2019s most exclusive music making gear. So when its website teased a new product with a colorful countdown, the wallets of Teenies everywhere braced for impact. Once that timer hit all zeros, the big reveal turned out to be the EP-133 sampler. Or, to give it its full name, the EP-133 K.O. II 64MB Sampler Composer. The real surprise though, was that it both looked cool and, at $299, was reasonably priced.\nFadergate\nThe countdown was really just the start. Barely 24 hours after the K.O. II was revealed units started landing in buyers\u2019 hands. Within days, YouTube was awash with first look videos and tutorials. Before our review unit even showed up, several users were complaining that theirs had defective faders. Enough folks were having this problem that it quickly became known as \u201cfadergate.\u201d One brave creator even took their unit apart and, possibly, discovered the cause \u2014 the internal pins were bent and not making a connection. I asked Teenage Engineering about the issue and will update this story once I hear back.\nSome buyer\u2019s theorized that the issue might be caused by the fact that the K.O. II ships without the caps on its rotaries and fader. They come loose in the box to enable the packaging to be flatter, but the cap for the fader is unusually tight fitting. This led to speculation that the enthusiasm required to push this cap down might be putting too much pressure on components inside, opening up the cruel possibility of users breaking their own devices before they even got to play with them. I used extra caution, along with some needle-nosed tweezers to support the fader as I applied its cap and so far\u2026 so good?\nPhoto by James Trew \/ Engadget\nThe K.O. II name tells us that Teenage Engineering considers this something of a sequel to the original PO-33 K.O. Clearly the K.O. II isn\u2019t a Pocket Operator, but its retro desk calculator aesthetic does take subtle design cues from that series. At 12-inches diagonally, it\u2019s in iPad territory size-wise. The K.O. II also runs on AAA batteries (or USB power) which is another nod to the PO series. It\u2019s hard to say how long it\u2019ll run on those batteries and it\u2019ll vary from brand to brand, but I\u2019ve been using some cheap rechargeables for over a week and they seem to be going strong.\nPersonally, I was never particularly enamored with the Pocket Operators and much prefer the form factor of the K.O. II. It\u2019s still very portable, but feels a bit more \u201cserious.\u201d It\u2019s also just very nice to look at, which is something Teenage Engineering is quite good at. The model number, EP-133, indicates that we might see others in the line, so fingers crossed for giant calculator versions of other instruments, too.\nIn use\nFader fully checked and batteries in place, the K.O. II springs to life with a flourish of icons across its display. Those icons are actually fixed and not made up of pixels. Teenage Engineering calls it a \u201cSuper segment hybrid display\u201d which basically fuses the digital watch part with a bunch of colorful, cute custom icons to let you know when certain modes or features are activated. It reminds me of the old Game & Watch handhelds where you can see where all the icons are and they are simply switched on or off as needed. Some of the icons are pretty abstract but there is a guide on the website to let you know that, for example, the red umbrella means undo.\nPhoto by James Trew \/ Engadget\nSomething I like to do with music gear is to see how easy it is to use without reading the manual. This works for all gadgets of course, but with music gear there are common tasks like sequencing, timing adjustment, automation and so on. How you achieve these on a drum machine might be very different to a keys-based synth. Teenage Engineering in particular likes to do things its own way but I was pleasantly surprised with the K.O. II. Within minutes I had managed to figure out basic navigation and how things are organized (sample groups, accessing shift functions, what the fader does and when and so on).\nDuring this blind test I also got to know the K.O. II\u2019s buttons and faders. It was obvious from the launch materials that we weren\u2019t getting rubber MPC-esque pads here but I would describe the ones on the K.O. as keys rather than buttons. Fortunately they are satisfying to click and they\u2019re pressure sensitive so you can give your drum hits different velocities or play notes at different strengths, just be sure to focus on the lower part of the key as that seems to be where the sensor is.\nYou probably should read the manual though. If for no other reason than it\u2019s likely the prettiest one you\u2019ll use in a while. There\u2019s also a very cute tool for managing your samples which works via desktop browser. For the brave, you can also use this on your phone if you have Android (Chrome, Brave and Opera should all work). On iOS the same browsers can\u2019t access Web MIDI and therefore will not work. (There\u2019s the iOS Web MIDI Browser which crashes when I tried it with an iPhone but it does connect so your mileage may vary.) The K.O. II won\u2019t show up on your PC as either a drive or an audio interface, so the main uses for the USB port are power and sending\/receiving MIDI.\nThe workflow for grabbing sounds is pretty straightforward. If you want to sample from either a PC or phone or other sound-making device then as long as you can connect it to a 3.5mm cable you\u2019re golden. For everything else, you\u2019ll be using the built-in mic, which is surprisingly good. I recorded a few short vocal phrases and other found sounds and they come out well, assuming you\u2019re in a quiet environment.\nPhoto by James Trew \/ Engadget\nDon\u2019t worry though, if you don\u2019t have a bunch of samples yet, the K.O. II comes with a bunch pre-installed, and they\u2019re pretty great. There\u2019s a good mix of drums, bass pads and lead sounds \u2014 certainly enough to get you going straight away. You\u2019ll definitely want to add your own though to make your projects unique. The presets use about half of the 64MB of memory, but you can back them up, delete them and free the slots up for your own. Max sample length is 20 seconds (same as on the OP-1 Field).\nIf 64MB doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, know that it translates to about 11 minutes of samples at the 46kHz\/16bit in which the K.O. II records. You can halve that time if you sample in stereo. Even if you go all out, over five minutes of samples should be plenty enough for most songs (we hope). If there\u2019s going to be a bottleneck, it\u2019ll more likely be due to the 12-voice limit. This means the K.O. II can make 12 sounds at once, so if you have six stereo samples playing at one time, you\u2019ll hit that limit. My compositions aren\u2019t interesting enough to hit that threshold, but if you\u2019re a maximalist, then it\u2019s worth keeping in mind.\nA common technique to help avoid hitting the voice limit on other devices is resampling \u2014 basically merging separate sounds down into one new sample. This is also the technique for baking in any effects and modulation, which, given that the K.O. II can only manage one master effect at any one time makes the lack of resampling all the more obvious. Understandably, it\u2019s possibly the biggest complaint among users I\u2019ve seen so far (after fadergate of course).\nThere are ways around this, but it would involve recording out into another device and then sampling that back into the K.O. II and no one should have a sampler for their sampler, not in this economy. Teenage Engineering does have a decent track record of adding functionality via firmware updates \u2014 the company just added a new effect to the OP-1 Field as I wrote this \u2014 so fingers crossed.\nPhoto by James Trew \/ Engadget\nWhile we\u2019re on the topic of features the K.O. II doesn\u2019t have, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any kind of song mode. There are four sample \u201cgroups\u201d that you can think of as tracks (drums, bass, lead and so on). Each of these groups can hold up to 99 patterns and patterns can be up to 99 bars in length. The active patterns across the four groups can be saved as a \u201cscene\u201d and scenes can be triggered consecutively. But, importantly, there\u2019s no way for that to happen automatically right now. This means if you wanted to tease a whole recorded song out of the K.O. II you\u2019ll have to either get clever with MIDI or trigger scenes and patterns manually in real time.\nThis performative nature might be a burden for songs, but I found it to be a feature in other areas. On top of the master effects you also have 12 \u201cpunch in\u201d effects that can be applied \u2014 or punched in \u2014 by holding down the FX key and then any of the 12 black pads. Each is marked with its effect name (Level, Pitch and so on). These punch-in effects express themselves differently based on the amount of pressure you apply, making it a very expressive experience. The effects on these keys also correspond to modulation tools when used with the fader. So FX+7 adds the \u201cLevel\u201d punch-in effect (rhythmic gating) while Fader+7 will assign gain\/level to the fader until you choose another modulator such as Attack or Low Pass Filter.\nI swear, half of the things you learn about how to use the K.O. II happen by accident. Yes, it\u2019s in the manual, but I discovered you can solo groups by pressing the FX button and the corresponding group. You can also press multiple buttons to \u201csolo\u201d multiple groups or sounds at the same time. With a group or group solo\u2019d you can then apply punch-in effects to create a lot of variations in real time. With so many touches like this, I am starting to assume that Teenage Engineering envisioned the K.O. II as a playful performative device rather than a linear song-making machine.\nPhoto by James Trew \/ Engadget\nI\u2019ve talked before about the sort of \u201cmagic\u201d factor that Teenage Engineering sometimes hides into its products. Just small, cute and often a bit hidden features that aren\u2019t necessary but are tons of fun. A common one is the inclusion of FM radio on the OP1\/Field and OB 4 etc. Or the video making tool in the app for the OP-Z. There was a brief moment of excitement when I spotted \u201cloop mode from OB-4\u201d on the K.O. II\u2019s product page. The hope being the two devices would interact somehow, but it appears that\u2019s just a way of describing the looping feature that\u2019s been borrowed from the OB-4.\nAs I write these closing thoughts, the second official firmware update (v1.1.1) has just been released. There\u2019s nothing spicy in here like motion control or sampling the radio, but it\u2019s confirmation of what I mentioned earlier about Teenage Engineering adding features after a product hits the shelves \u2014 such as the OP-1 Field\u2019s vocoder synth that landed over six months after release or the fairly substantial 1.2.38 update for the OP-Z which came almost three years into its life.\nThe K.O. II represents an opportunity for Teenage Engineering to do the unthinkable and create a series of more capable instruments that don\u2019t cost Field-series levels of money. As a sampler, it\u2019s great for beginners or those who love a more performative style. It\u2019s not nearly as detailed and in-depth as something like Roland\u2019s SP 404 or Native Instruments\u2019 Maschine, but it was never going to be a rival to, well, anything really. Fadergate aside, this is a promising product from a company that has tested the loyalty of its fans more than usual in recent years.\nAll products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

{"title":"Fundamental Investing: The Art of Relative Valuation","context":"## Fundamental Investing: The Art of Relative Valuation\n\nThe PE (price to earnings ratio) of a stock is 18. Is that cheap or expensive? Well, it depends. On what? Many things! Welcome to the world of relative valuation.\nThe findings from research done a decade earlier by Aswath Damodaran indicated that around 85 per cent of valuation done by equity research analysts and 50 per cent of corporate M&A transactions were based on relative valuation. So, what exactly is this relative valuation?\nIt is the art of attempting to determine the fair value of a stock based on how it is valued relative to many factors. So, whether the PE of a stock is 15 or 18 or 30, the only way you can make an assessment of whether it is cheap or expensive is by analysing this one number \u2014 against its growth prospects, peer company multiples, industry trading range, historical average PE, the prevailing interest rates, etc.\nPortfolio podcast: The art of valuing stocks Portfolio podcast: The art of valuing stocks\nLet there be no doubt, valuation experts like Aswath Damodaran and many successful hedge fund managers believe that absolute valuation (which we discussed in the Big Story in bl.portfolio edition dated October 8) is the better way to arrive at the value of a stock.\nHowever, due to a combination of complexities involved in building appropriate models, insufficient information, time constraints and also the fact that there are hundreds of stocks you want to consider, it is just not possible to do a DCF ( discounted cash flow model) for all your stock investments, and hence relative valuation as an approach to picking stocks too is well accepted and widely prevalent.\nWhen you decide to buy or sell a stock based on its PE or P\/B or EV\/EBITDA or EV\/Revenue or even EV\/subscriber ratios, you are engaging in the art of relative valuation. And it\u2019s totally fine to be an investor relying on relative valuation to make your savings work for you, provided you approach it the right way and ensure adequate risk management. In relative valuation, the broader you assess the valuation, ie assess valuation multiple against more parameters, the better the perspective you get.\nIn simple words, one way to understand the difference between absolute valuation (explained in last week\u2019s edition) and relative valuation is this \u2013 absolute valuation is made up of an interesting story that is backed by credible and validated numbers, while relative valuation is made up of an interesting number backed by a credible and validated story.\nWhat are those numbers in relative valuation? Every number in relative valuation is the result of a number A divided by a number B. For example, PE is price of the stock divided by its earnings. These are all numbers that are used to compare against similar metrics of other stocks and assess the merits of the stock.\nBefore we proceed on using relative valuation to pick stocks, it is important to understand that you can do relative valuation using equity multiples or firm\/enterprise multiples.\nEquity multiples\nIf you check the balance sheet of any company, the liabilities side is primarily made up of two line items \u2014 shareholder funds and borrowings. To the contrary, a Profit and Loss statement has many line items \u2014 starting with revenue, followed by variable costs and then fixed costs and taxes. The only claim that equity shareholders have for distribution or for appropriation amongst themselves is what is left after paying the taxes \u2014 net profit.\nSo, if you are doing relative valuation based on equity multiples, it is important to ensure you divide the equity \u2013 ie price per share or market cap of the company by line items that apply to equity shareholders.\nBased on this, there are only 3 items that can be attributed to equity shareholders \u2014 net profit from P&L statement, book value or shareholder funds from the Balance Sheet, and the free cash flows to equity (FCFE) from the cash flow statement. Any relative valuation multiples will be linked to these three items one way or the other. Any other metric could be wrong and misleading.\nFor example, price by revenue or price by EBITDA is incorrect. Why? How do you differentiate between two companies A and B \u2014 both having same market cap of \u20b9100 and similar in all means except for debt levels \u2014 same revenue (\u20b9100) and same gross margin and same EBITDA margins of 20 per cent and thus same EBITDA of \u20b920. But A has zero debt, while B has debt of \u20b910. Since revenue or sales and EBITDA are same, if you do a market cap\/revenue or Price \/Sales, or marketcap\/EBITDA, both companies will have the same valuation.\nHowever, let\u2019s assume depreciation is \u20b910, interest cost is 10 per cent and taxes are zero. This means the net profit of A is \u20b910, while that of B is \u20b99. Thus although both companies are similar in terms of Price\/Revenue and Price\/EBITDA, A is cheaper on the PE ratio \u2013 ie PE of A is 10 and PE of B is 11.1. On a relative valuation basis, you must choose A instead of B, but you would not have spotted it if you had used incorrect metrics.\nHence it\u2019s very important to use the right multiples. When it comes to equity metrics, it always has to be price or market cap (or variations of the same) in numerator divided by line items attributable to equity holders (or variations of the same)\nThe accompanying table gives the commonly used equity multiples for relative valuation.\nOnce the metrics and importance are understood, there are, as such, no limits to how you can use them to pick stocks. You can use one or two metrics or a combination of many more metrics to assess which stocks are undervalued or overvalued.\nDepending on specific cases, you can use further variations to pick stocks. For example, during the 2003-2007 bull market, many textile stocks, for instance, Bombay Dyeing, turned out to be multibaggers. Was their textile business booming? Not really. But the stocks were zooming because there was real estate boom and many textile mills had manufacturing facilities in prime real estate locations. So the markets started to factor value of the company based on market value of their land. In such a case you can deviate from Price\/Book multiple to price\/market value of net assets (assets \u2013 net debt).\nSimilar is the case with holding companies. If you think there is a reasonable case for underlying value of assets to be unlocked and Holdco discount to shrink, like it has happened in bank holding companies in the last 2-3 years, then there is a case to move beyond book value to market value.\nEnterprise value multiples\nEnterprise value refers to total value of a company\/business. This total value as perceived by the market is represented by the sum of its market cap + net debt (includes minority interest). What works in the case of EV is that it helps in doing a capital-agnostic analysis of a company. Whether a company is funded only with equity, or a combination of equity and debt, the total value of the business is the same. Sources of funding don\u2019t matter.\nUsing EV, the value of equity (share price) is derived from the value of the business. Since the capital structure of companies varies significantly, an EV approach enables valuing them on similar terms. One can arrive at the value of the business first and then subtract net debt, to arrive at the equity value. The advantage with EV-based metrics is that you have more options to value a company.\nBear in mind, valuation accuracy is better the lower down the P&L and cash flow statement one can get to. But there are many times when company profits are low, but its operational performance ie EBITDA is not bad. In such cases, as revenue and EBITDA continue to grow, operating leverage will result in PE growing much faster than the above two line items.\nFor example, take the case of Bharti Airtel: at the start of FY22 (April \u201821) its trailing PE was negative\/invalid due to losses in FY21. The stock would have been avoided if one went by PE alone. However, on trailing EV\/EBITDA basis, it was trading at 10 times EV\/EBITDA. When this was considered against its estimated next 2 years EBITDA CAGR of over 20 per cent, the valuation, combined with qualitative factors, made it an interesting buy. Since then, net profits have improved substantially as operating leverage played out.\nAt bl.portfolio we had recommended a buy on the stock based on this in April 2021 and the stock has returned 80 per cent since. The stock would have been easily missed if PE was the metric used to spot the performers.\nHence EV-based metrics are options to consider as well when equity-based valuation multiples do not give a clear picture. Where even EBITDA multiples are not clear, as was the case with many new-age company IPOs that were reporting losses even at the EBITDA level, investors have no option but to go further up the P&L to metrics like EV\/revenue, or even outside of P&L to use metrics like EV\/subscriber.\nAs we mentioned earlier, relative valuation represents a number backed by a credible and well-validated story. Hence, you can use non-P&L multiples. So when you compare companies and invest in one based on EV\/Subscriber, there must be a credible story backing future monetisation of the subscriber in a profitable manner. But do bear in mind, the risks are higher and so may be the rewards or pain as the case may be. When the risks are higher, you must apply a higher margin of safety before choosing the stock.\nAnother thing to bear in mind when it comes to EV-based valuation \u2014 any change in EV will impact only the equity value. For example, if EV of a company is \u20b9100 and it has \u20b950 in debt, then the value of its equity is \u20b950. In this case, if you think EV can increase by 10 per cent, the value of equity will increase by 20 per cent, and the reverse is also true. The higher the leverage, more the impact of change in EV on the value of the stock (both ways).\nKeep a weather eye on Ketchup Economics\nGiven the fact that relative valuation is based on comparison with peer multiples, investors must take measures to check whether the peer multiples are reasonable as well. An overvalued peer cannot be used to justify expensive valuation in one stock. This is what economist Larry Summers termed as Ketchup economists\/economics. It was his sarcastic take on some of the highly paid economists and finance professionals who are concerned only with inter-relationships between prices of different financial assets. Based on this approach, they conclude whether the price of an asset independently is efficient or not. If two bottles of ketchup sell for twice as much as one bottle (except for minor differences traceable to transaction costs), the market is efficient.\nThe risk in this \u2013 it ignores the aspect of whether one bottle of ketchup is priced rationally. Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman once explained how the US housing bubble that precipitated the global financial crisis reminded him of ketchup economists. Before purchasing a house during the bubble, buyers carefully compared prices with \u2018prices of other houses\u2019, but ignored whether the overall level of a home price made sense.\nHow to avoid pitfalls\nSo, what can you do to avoid pitfalls while using relative valuation? Here are a few pointers.\nOne, after comparing stocks based on relative valuation, you can do more layers of comparison by assessing how their valuation fares relative to growth prospects. This apart, many other factors can justify different valuations. For example, TCS has always commanded a valuation premium to peer stocks like Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech because of its superior margins and much more consistent growth. So just because the other stocks are cheaper on PE basis does not mean they are cheap compared to TCS. So you can also do one more layer of comparison by assessing each company\u2019s valuation against its long-term (5-10 years) mean and median valuations and assess how they fare relative to their own history.\nTwo, equity valuations do not function in a silo. Investors have many options \u2014 fixed deposits, bonds, real estate, etc. When other assets get more attractive one must assess scope for valuation change in equities as well. For example, interest rates and bond yields in many developed markets, including the US, are at their highest levels since 2007. This means investors may have to assess current valuations not just against last 10 years\u2019 valuations, but of prior periods as well.\nWhy? Near zero interest rates and low bond yields made stocks with earnings yield of mere 1-2 per cent attractive for an FPI \u2014 for example stocks such as Asian Paints, Nestle India and ABB India which today trade at PE of 65, 83 and 85 times respectively. This implies earnings yield of 1.5 per cent for Asian Paints and 1.2 per cent for Nestle and ABB. Such earnings yields of these stocks were fine for FPIs to hold when compared to zero interest income in their domestic market. But now, with US bond yields offering 5 per cent, these may not be so attractive even when considering the growth prospects. While Indian interest rates were always higher, investors in equities benefited from the global investors\u2019 hunger for yields. That advantage is diminishing today. This is not a recommendation on the stocks, but pointers on factors to consider to make your relative valuation process more foolproof.\nWith discipline and experience, the process will keep getting better.\n\nThis article was published by Business Line on 2023-10-14 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":418}

Theaters nationwide brace for impact","context":"## Taylor Swift has already sold over $100 million of tickets for her concert movie. Theaters nationwide brace for impact\n\nGreg Marcus has been in the movie business for years but he never expected to be urging moviegoers to take out their phones during a film \u2014 let alone to be crafting friendship bracelets in preparation for an opening weekend.\nBut there the chief executive and chair of the Marcus Corporation is in a promotion for his theater chain headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, stringing beads together while humming \u201cShake It Off.\u201d\nMovie theaters are readying for an onslaught like they\u2019ve never seen before, beginning Friday when \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d debuts. The concert film, compiled from several Swift shows at Southern California\u2019s SoFi Stadium, is expected to launch with $100 million, or possibly more. Advance ticket sales worldwide have already surpassed $100 million.\nSwifties will descend. Dancing will be encouraged.\n\u201cThis is different,\u201d says Marcus. \u201cTake your phone out. Take selfies. Dance, sing, get up, have a good time. We want to create an atmosphere.\u201d\nConcert films, of course, aren\u2019t anything new. Just last month, the Talking Heads classic \u201cStop Making Sense\u201d returned to theaters for a decades-later encore. But \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d heralds something new and potentially game-changing in the movie industry.\nTwo of the biggest stars on the planet \u2014 Swift and , in December under a very similar arrangement, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 are heading into cinemas in first-of-their-kind deals made directly with AMC Theaters that circumvent Hollywood studios and which, for now, leave streamers waiting on the sidelines.\nBut how did the once declared-for-dead multiplex become the go-to place this fall a pair of stars previously at home on Netflix?\nWhen studios began diverting some of their titles to streaming platforms, movie theaters began thinking harder about how they could fill their screens \u2014 a question exacerbated this autumn by an actors strike that\u2019s led to the postponement of big releases like \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d\nMovie theaters are increasingly not just a marquee of movie showtimes but a big-screen stage for a variety of visual media. BTS earlier this year released a concert film, with higher ticket prices and limited showtimes. The Metropolitan Opera has for years done popular live broadcasts in theaters.\nFew acts can do what Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 can. Their expected success is unlikely to be replicated. But \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d could be the start of an expansion of what, exactly, a movie theater can be. Think the Sphere, only much cheaper and in most towns.\n\u201cYou could say we\u2019re in the movie business, but really we\u2019re in the getting-together-with-other-people business,\u201d says Marcus. \u201cThe more we do of it, the more the customers will think about it and the more talent will go: This is something I could do.\u201d\nSwift\u2019s camp was motivated to get the film out even as her stadium tour continues internationally. The tour, which is projected by Pollstar to gross some $1.4 billion, crashed Ticketmaster\u2019s site, saw sky-high resale mark-ups and left many fans priced out.\nThe movie, directed by Sam Wrench, would be a way for millions more to experience the Eras Tour. Adult tickets are being sold for $19.89, a reference to her birth year and 2014 album, a re-recording of which is due out Oct. 27. That\u2019s higher than the average movie ticket but several thousand less than many tickets to see Swift live.\nIt\u2019s arriving uncommonly fast, too, just a little over two months since the SoFi shows. Speed was one reason Swift\u2019s father, Scott Swift, is said to have sought out a direct deal with AMC. Swift produced the film, herself, and, with 274 million followers on Instagram, didn\u2019t need a studio to promote it.\nThe pop star\u2019s apparent relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has only further brightened the spotlight on the movie. According to ad tracking firm iSpot, TV ads for the film ran only a few dozen times as of Oct. 6, including several spots during NFL broadcasts. (A Marvel movie, by comparison, might run several thousand TV commercials.)\nTicket sales will be split 43% with theaters and 57% shared by Swift and AMC \u2014 with the lion\u2019s share of that going to Swift. The film will play exclusively in theaters for at least 13 weeks \u2014 longer than many Hollywood releases do now. AMC CEO Adam Aron has called the deal \u201ca coup for AMC\u201d on social media.\nBoth AMC and representatives for Swift declined to discuss the film\u2019s release.\nAfter a premiere in Los Angeles on Wednesday, there won\u2019t be any advance screenings until the movie begins playing at 6 p.m. local time Friday. Most wide-release movies open with Thursday showings and Friday daytime screenings. It\u2019s another wrinkle in a nontraditional release that\u2019s challenging Hollywood norms.\n\u201cInnovation comes out of challenging times in this business. We\u2019re seeing a lot of changes, some subtle, some not so subtle,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. \u201cIt seems like, right now, there are no rules when it comes to being successful.\u201d\nDergarabedian believes the two concert films should help lift the North American box office to more than $9 billion in 2023, up from the $7.4 billion of last year and edging closer to the $11.4 billion of 2019.\n\u201cIt really opens up the idea that other types of content can play really well in a movie theater,\u201d he says.\nSome of those changes have been facilitated by the abolishment of long-held antitrust restrictions governing movie distribution. After more than 70 years of regulating divisions between exhibition and distribution, the Paramount consent decrees were terminated in 2020 at the urging of the Department of Justice, with a two-year sunset period that ran until last year.\n\u201cInnovation had effectively been stunted,\u201d says Makan Delrahim, the former antitrust chief at the Justice Department who proposed ending the consent decrees.\nDelrahim believes \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d \u2014 as a movie distributed by a theater chain, with nontraditional ticket prices \u2014 could \u201cfuel new business models to save the exhibitors.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be more appetite to experiment different models for theatrical distribution,\u201d Delrahim says. \u201cThe industry needs it and, frankly, so do consumers.\u201d\nMeanwhile, \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d is poised to become the biggest concert film ever in about two days of release. Not accounting for inflation, 2011\u2019s \u201cJustin Bieber: Never Say Never\u201d holds that mark with $73.1 million across its entire run. Accounting for inflation, it will be harder for \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d to catch \u201cWoodstock,\u201d which grossed $50 million in 1970, a total that translates to nearly $400 million today.\nIn Marcus\u2019 theaters, like many other chains, there will be friendship bracelet stations. Sound systems have been modified for more of a concert feel. And while Marcus grants it will be strange to see an AMC logo before a film playing in his theaters, he doesn\u2019t particularly mind.\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy it\u2019s there,\u201d he says.\n\nThis article, authored by Jake Coyle, The Associated Press, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-10 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":419}
