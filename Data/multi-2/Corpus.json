{"title":"Line Shopping in Sports Betting - How to Find the Best Odds","context":"## Line Shopping in Sports Betting - How to Find the Best Odds\n\nLine shopping is the key that unlocks the best odds and lines at top sports betting sites.\nThe process is as simple as checking the lines and odds for your prospective bet at multiple online sports betting sites. The result is quite often better odds and improved lines.\nWhat is line shopping, and why is it worth your time? Find the answers below in our complete guide to line shopping.\nHow do sportsbooks set odds and lines?\nThe best sportsbooks employ oddsmakers and oddsmaking services to set their lines and odds.\nOther sports betting apps simply copy those lines. The oddsmakers and oddsmaking services use computer models and algorithms that consider analytics, statistics, injury and roster news, performance, matchup data, and more to develop the lines and odds.\nBetting lines and odds are then subject to change based on the betting public\u2019s reaction and any additional information that comes to light ahead of the game. Sportsbooks will move the line or change the odds if the public bets heavily on one side.\nEvery sportsbook\u2019s goal is to even out the betting on both sides of every bet. That allows sportsbooks to earn the profit built into the odds and lines without worrying about which side wins.\nThe betting is rarely the same at every sportsbook. While one sportsbook may be forced to move a line or change the odds because of betting, another won\u2019t. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll spot a difference between sportsbooks. This difference may allow you to book a bet at improved odds or a more favorable line.\nThe lines and odds may even be different right from the jump. Either way, the differences are why line shopping always makes sense. Shop around, and you can find opportunities to lay less, win more, and improve your chances.\nSee more: How to bet on sports in the US\nShop for the best lines at online sportsbooks\nBelow is a live odds feed that shows you the differences between lines and odds for the same bets at many of the top sportsbooks in the country. Look here for current opportunities.\nWhat\u2019s the best way to shop lines?\nThe easiest way to line-shop is to find something like the live odds feed above. It\u2019s a one-stop shop. Shopping lines here will take just seconds.\nPerforming the task manually may take longer, but you can check with more sportsbooks or the chosen few you feel consistently offer the best lines and odds. The best way to do this is to download and install more than one of the best sports betting apps on your phone.\nThen, tap around among the sportsbooks to compare lines and odds for the bets you plan.\nBest sportsbooks for line shopping\nThe biggest brands in sports betting offer competitive lines in dozens of states. Shop around at the following top online sportsbooks to find the best prices on your bets.\nCaesars Sportsbook\nCaesars' odds and lines are consistently among the best in the country, making it a must-see when shopping lines. The point spreads here can be a half-point to two points better than the competition\u2019s, and the moneyline odds may be more favorable.\nBetMGM Sportsbook\nThe lines and odds at BetMGM are consistently competitive. Plus, sports betting promos and odds boosts abound, so you'll find a better price on many bets here.\nDraftKings Sportsbook\nDraftKings has more open betting markets than most online sportsbooks, and the lines and odds are always competitive.\nFanDuel Sportsbook\nFanDuel is committed to posting competitive odds and runs so many generous promos and odds boosts that it is always worth a look.\nHow to find the best lines and odds for any bet\nShopping around lets you find the best lines and odds for any bet. That means checking the posted lines and odds for the same bets at different sportsbooks.\nYou can do this for moneylines, point spreads, totals bets, prop bets, and more. Finding the best line or better odds on any bet is like finding money.\nYou can shop around using multiple sportsbook apps on your phone or live odds feeds like the one above. Pick a side, then use the drop-down menus and tabs to find the odds and lines for that bet.\nFinally, bet when you see an opportunity at better odds or an improved line compared to the competition.\nLine shopping for futures\nPeople tend to bet futures at their favorite online sportsbook. However, shopping for better odds on any future bet is worth your time. Most game lines are similar at different sportsbooks, but the odds in futures markets can vary significantly.\nSportsbooks sometimes have higher liabilities for specific teams and offer better odds on others to lay that off. Timing is everything.\nGet it right, and you can easily take advantage of changes in different futures markets due to liability. However, the only way to find these opportunities is shopping lines.\nSee more: NFL futures bets\nCan I get a better line or odds after I\u2019ve already bet?\nWhen you bet, you lock in the odds or line as currently posted. If they change, for better or worse, you\u2019re stuck with the odds from when you wagered.\nThat\u2019s precisely why you should go line shopping before you bet. Of course, if significant changes occur, you can take more action at the improved odds or more favorable line.\nIs line shopping worth my time?\nBecause it can provide you the opportunity to lay less, win more, and improve your chances, line shopping is certainly worth your time. Plus, it doesn\u2019t have to take up all that much of it.\nUse the live odds feed above to do a basic survey. You\u2019ll find it takes just seconds to compare lines and odds. Plus, download and install multiple licensed online sportsbook apps on your phone, and you can do a more thorough shop in just a few minutes.\nGetting more points or laying fewer on a typical NFL point spread or NBA point spread might lead to winning a bet you\u2019d otherwise lose. Plus, if you find better odds on any bet, you can potentially drop fewer dollars when you lose and earn more when you win.\nShopping lines will help you consistently find the best prices on your bets. It won't help you pick more winners, but it will improve your chances and lead to bigger wins and more affordable losses. That\u2019s undoubtedly worth your time.\nFor example, you might like the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Cincinnati Bengals in a mid-season NFL game. Say you look around and see that three of four licensed online sportsbooks in your state have the Chiefs as -3 favorites, but the fourth has them at just -2.5.\nLet\u2019s say the Chiefs win by exactly three, a distinct possibility since a single field goal decides most NFL games. Bets at the first three sportsbooks would push. However, you\u2019d have a winner at the fourth. If you didn\u2019t shop around, you\u2019d never have found that half-point victory and be stuck with a push instead of a profit.\nWhat is the Vegas line?\nLas Vegas sportsbooks set the standard for lines and odds across the country. If a sportsbook is copying a line, it\u2019s usually copying the Vegas line. Most online betting sites don\u2019t stray too far from the Vegas line, using it as a foundation for setting all lines in every major sport.\nIf those lines do shift, it\u2019s usually because of increased betting on one side of a bet. Shop lines locally, and you can take advantage when sportsbooks stray from the Vegas line.\nWhy do the lines move?\nIt\u2019s worth reiterating that sportsbooks want an equal amount of money bet on each side of every bet. When that happens, they earn the small profit built into the odds without concern about who wins or loses.\nSportsbooks want even betting so much that they\u2019ll move a line or change the odds to draw more bets to the other side to get it that way.\nThat\u2019s when you\u2019ll see a difference between the lines and odds. Every sportsbook jumps on board when a line moves or odds change for a legitimate reason, like an injury or roster move. It\u2019ll be difficult for you to find value in that case.\nBut when a line moves or odds change because of betting patterns, only the sportsbook that saw the betting makes the change. That\u2019s your opportunity right there.\nLine shopping is a tool to help you spot changes due to betting patterns. Then, you can simply take advantage of movement in a line or changes in the odds.\nChoose a side, shop around at online sportsbooks, compare the lines and odds, and then pounce when you find one that has something different and more favorable to your viewpoint.\nSee more: What is a parlay bet?\n\nThis article, authored by Martin Derbyshire, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-06 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":60}
{"title":"Moneyline Betting - What is the Moneyline and How Does it Work?","context":"## Moneyline Betting - What is the Moneyline and How Does it Work?\n\nThe primary draw of the moneyline bet lies in its simplicity. Even those just dipping their toes into the world of sports betting for the first time can quickly get a handle on the basics of the moneyline.\nOn this page we'll unpack the ins and outs of moneyline betting in more detail.\nWhat is a moneyline bet?\nSo, what's the essence of a moneyline bet? In this type of bet, the sole focus is identifying the winner.\nThe victory margin and the total points scored have no bearing. It doesn't matter if your chosen team clinches a win with a score of 2-1 or a blowout of 50-0; the payout remains unchanged.\nIn this way, the moneyline distills sports to their essence: cheering for a victor.\nEvery moneyline bet has a favorite and an underdog as determined by the sportsbook. In the context of moneyline betting, \"favorites\" and \"underdogs\" refer to the perceived stronger and weaker participants, respectively.\nFavorites:\nThe favorite is the participant (be it a team or an individual) who is expected to win the event or matchup.\nIn moneyline odds, especially in American odds format, the favorite is usually represented with a minus (-) sign. For instance, if Team A is a favorite and is listed at -150, a bettor would need to wager $150 to win $100.\nUnderdogs:\nThe underdog is the participant deemed less likely to win compared to the opponent.\nUnderdogs in moneyline odds, particularly in the American odds format, are usually represented with a plus (+) sign. If Team B is an underdog and has odds of +130, a bettor would win $130 for every $100 they bet, should Team B win.\nMoneyline odds formats\nYou'll typically encounter three types of odds when researching and handicapping across various platforms\u2014decimal, fractional, and American.\nMost listings on the best online sports betting sites predominantly use American Odds.\nAmerican Odds\nYou'll usually see these displayed as either a negative (-) or positive (+) number, symbolizing different implications in the betting world.\nThe negative numbers might seem a bit perplexing at first. They point to the team, player, or option considered the favorite to win.\nThis number can also represent wagers that are less than even money. Essentially, the negative figure tells you how much you need to bet to earn a profit of $100. We'll clarify with an example shortly.\nConversely, positive odds signal the underdog in the betting scenario or bets that offer more than even money. This figure shows how much profit you'll make on a $100 wager.\nTo illustrate with a moneyline bet: Imagine on a top NFL betting site the New England Patriots are listed as -110 favorites, while the New York Jets stand at +250.\nYou decide to back the favorite and bet $110 on the Pats. The Pats win, and you end up with $210.\nThat sum comprises your initial $110 bet and the $100 profit you've earned.\nFractional Odds\nWhile you might occasionally encounter these odds, especially in contexts like horse racing, they're quite straightforward once you get the hang of them, even if they initially seem like a math problem.\nThese odds typically look like two numbers separated by a slash (\/) or a dash (-), resembling a fraction. For instance, you might see 5\/1 or 5-1.\nHere's a simple way to interpret fractions: the first number (akin to the numerator in math) represents potential profit, while the second (akin to the denominator) indicates the amount you need to stake.\nIn other words, the denominator tells you how much you need to bet to earn a profit equivalent to the numerator.\nFor example, with 2\/1 odds, you'd earn $2 for every $1 you wager. Conversely, with 4\/9 odds, a bet of $9 would yield a $4 profit.\nTo further illustrate, if you placed a bet of $9 at 4\/9 odds and won, you'd receive $13 in total: your initial $9 stake plus the $4 profit.\nDecimal Odds\nDecimals are to betting what the metric system is to measurements: straightforward and user-friendly. They present fewer intricacies compared to their American and fractional counterparts.\nHowever, just as the metric system is not universally embraced in the US, decimal odds can also be overlooked there.\nFortunately, working with decimal odds is simple. To determine a bet's payout, you multiply the decimal odds by the amount you're betting.\nFor instance, if the odds on an NHL betting site have the Edmonton Oilers at 2.53 to beat the Detroit Red Wings, a $10 bet would yield a $25.30 return. This includes your initial $10 wager, along with a profit of $15.30.\nIt's essential to note that this calculation gives you the total payout, not just your earnings. If you're keen on tracking your profits from betting, remember to subtract your original stake from the payout to get an accurate figure.\nWhy do moneyline odds change?\nLines at the best sports betting apps change quickly due to two primary reasons:\nPublic betting\nNew information\nBefore setting odds for an event, oddsmakers gather extensive data. Once they finalize the odds, they release them to the public.\nAs a bettor, you can bet immediately or wait for potential shifts in the odds, although predicting these shifts is challenging.\nFor instance, when examining odds for the next Super Bowl champion released shortly after the previous Super Bowl, these odds are based mostly on the recently concluded season.\nAs the new season approaches and teams make changes, odds adjust based on perceived championship chances. As games progress, lines continue to evolve based on team performances.\nPublic betting can also sway lines. If too many wagers favor one outcome, sportsbooks adjust the odds to balance the bets. This ensures an even distribution of bets and reduces the sportsbook's financial risk.\nMoneyline betting outcomes\nWhen you\u2019re placing a moneyline wager, several outcomes are possible. The most straightforward outcome is a win or a loss, determined by whether the team or individual you bet on is victorious or defeated.\nThere's also the possibility of a draw, which occurs if the event ends in a tie.\nMoneyline win\nWinning a moneyline bet is very straightforward. All you need to do is pick the team or individual who is going to win an event and choose correctly.\nIf you bet on a boxing match between Boxer A and Boxer B, and you've bet on Boxer B to win and he does, then your bet would be successful and you'd get paid based on the odds at the time you placed your wager.\nMoneyline loss\nWhen placing a moneyline wager, a loss simply means that the team or individual you bet on did not win the event or matchup.\nFor example, let's say on an NBA betting site you bet on a basketball game between Team A and Team B. You believe Team A will win, so you place a $100 moneyline wager on them. If Team B wins, your bet on Team A would be a loss.\nDraw\nIn some sports, notably soccer, games can end in a draw, and bettors have the option to wager on this outcome. When placing a moneyline wager in such situations, you'll typically see three sets of odds: one for each team to win and one for the game to end in a draw.\nFor instance, consider a soccer match between Team A and Team B. The moneyline odds might look something like this:\nTeam A: +150\n+150 Draw: +220\n+220 Team B: +180\nIf you believe the game will end in a tie, you could place a $100 wager on the \"Draw\" option. If the match indeed concludes with a tied score, you would win based on the +220 odds. This means you'd receive $220 in profit on top of your $100 stake, totaling $320. However, if either Team A or Team B wins, you'd lose your $100 wager.\nSee more: Best soccer betting sites\nMoneyline betting examples by sport\nBelow are some examples of typical moneyline bets you'll find for various professional sports.\nMoneyline odds in football\nNFL moneyline odds for a game between the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants might look something like this:\nDallas Cowboys: -130\n-130 New York Giants: +110\nHere, the Cowboys are the favorites, indicated by the negative odds. If you bet $130 on the Cowboys and they win, you would earn a profit of $100.\nThe New York Giants are the underdogs, as shown by the positive odds. If you wager $100 on the Giants and they pull off an upset victory, you would earn a profit of $110.\nMoneyline odds in basketball\nNBA moneyline odds for a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat might be presented as:\nLos Angeles Lakers: -150\n-150 Miami Heat: +130\nIn this scenario, the Lakers are favored to win, as indicated by the negative odds. If you back the Lakers with a bet of $150 and they win, you would earn a profit of $100.\nThe Heat are the underdogs. If you place a $100 bet on the Heat and they win, your profit would be $130.\nMoneyline odds in baseball\nMLB moneyline odds for a game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox might look like this:\nNew York Yankees: -120\n-120 Boston Red Sox: +100\nThe Yankees are slight favorites. If you bet $120 on the Yankees and they win, you'd earn a profit of $100. The Red Sox have even odds, shown by the +100. This means if you bet $100 on the Red Sox and they win, you'd also earn a profit of $100.\nMoneyline odds in hockey\nNHL moneyline odds for a game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Chicago Blackhawks might be displayed as:\nToronto Maple Leafs: -140\n-140 Chicago Blackhawks: +120\nIf you put down $140 on the Maple Leafs and they win, you would earn a profit of $100. If you bet $100 on the Blackhawks and they pull off a win, you'd receive a profit of $120.\nMoneyline odds in soccer\nSoccer moneyline odds for an MLS match between the Seattle Sounders and Atlanta United might look like this:\nSeattle Sounders: +110\n+110 Draw: +230\n+230 Atlanta United: +140\nIn this scenario, neither team is a clear favorite, but the Seattle Sounders have slightly better odds. If you bet $100 on the Sounders and they win, you'd earn a profit of $110.\nIf you believe the match might end in a tie, you could place a bet on the \"Draw\" option. A $100 bet on a draw would result in a $230 profit if the match ends tied.\nMeanwhile, if you back Atlanta United with a $100 wager and they win, you'd secure a profit of $140.\nRemember, in soccer, the possibility of a draw is a common outcome to bet on, which is different from many other major sports.\nMoneyline odds in MMA\/UFC\nUFC moneyline odds for a fight between Conor McGregor and Dustin Poirier might look like this:\nConor McGregor: -200\n-200 Dustin Poirier: +170\nIf you bet $200 on McGregor and he wins the fight, you'd earn a profit of $100. If you bet $100 on Poirier and he wins, you would earn a profit of $170.\nMoneyline odds in tennis\nTennis odds for a match between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova might be displayed as:\nSerena Williams: -150\n-150 Maria Sharapova: +130\nIn this hypothetical matchup, Serena is the favorite to win. If you bet $150 on Williams and she wins, you would earn a profit of $100. Sharapova is the underdog. If you place a $100 wager on Sharapova and she manages to win, you'll receive a profit of $130.\nMoneyline odds in golf\nLet's consider some PGA tour odds at one of the best golf betting sites where you're betting on an individual golfer to win. The moneyline odds might be presented as:\nTiger Woods: +500\n+500 Rory McIlroy: +600\nIn this hypothetical tournament scenario, neither golfer is a strong favorite, but the odds indicate their perceived chances to win. If you decide to bet $100 on Tiger Woods and he wins the tournament, you'd earn a profit of $500.\nOn the other hand, if you place a $100 wager on Rory McIlroy and he clinches the tournament victory, you'd secure a profit of $600.\nIt's important to note that in PGA and other golf tournaments, there are usually many players, so the odds can be much higher than in head-to-head sports matchups, given the broader field of competition.\nMoneyline Betting FAQ\nHow do moneyline bets work?\nMoneylines hinge on the outright winner of a game or event. They are presented with either a positive (+) or negative (-) sign:\nA positive moneyline (+) indicates the underdog and represents the amount of profit on a $100 bet.\nA negative moneyline (-) indicates the favorite and shows how much you need to bet to earn a $100 profit.\nWhat happens if there\u2019s a tie in a moneyline bet?\nIf there's a tie in a moneyline bet, it is typically referred to as a \"push.\" When a push occurs, bettors are refunded their original wager. No money is won or lost. However, sports that typically have the possibility of a tie (like soccer) often provide bettors with the option to bet on a draw.\nIf the game ends in a draw and you haven't bet on that option, you would lose your bet. It's essential to understand the specific rules of the sportsbook and the sport you're betting on to know how ties are handled.\nDoes overtime count in my moneyline bet?\nYes, in most sports and with most sportsbooks (including new betting sites), overtime (or any extra time or tiebreakers) does count in a moneyline bet.\nThat said, always check the specific rules of the sportsbook you're using to ensure you understand their policies.\nWhy do moneyline odds change?\nMoneyline odds change for several reasons.\nPublic Betting Patterns: If a significant amount of money is being placed on one team or participant, sportsbooks might adjust the odds to balance their liability. By making the odds less favorable for a heavily-bet team and more favorable for the less-bet team, they can encourage more even betting.\nIf a significant amount of money is being placed on one team or participant, sportsbooks might adjust the odds to balance their liability.

But sportsbooks are also gathering this information, and they begin to tighten the NBA Rookie of the Year lines in response.\nSo, while you can better guess which player will hoist the Wilt Chamberlain Trophy, the odds will be tighter, and your potential return on your wager will be reduced.\nPros and cons of betting early on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\nPros:\nYou have an opportunity to find better value.\nThe betting odds are fresh and haven't been adjusted.\nCons:\nThere is a much higher risk as a player's performance, health, and team dynamic can change throughout the season.\nYou\u2019ll find limited information to make an informed bet.\nPros and cons of waiting to bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\nPros:\nThere is a lot more information available to make an informed bet.\nYou don\u2019t risk betting on a player not remotely in contention.\nCons:\nThere is a reduced opportunity to find value.\nThe odds may not be as favorable.\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s always important to take into consideration your risk tolerance while you weigh the potential rewards. No matter when you decide to make your wager, always gather as much information as possible before risking your hard-earned money.\nWho are the past NBA ROTY winners?\nFor context, here is a list of the National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year winners since 2010.\nSeason Player Position Team 2023 Paolo Banchero Forward Orlando Magic 2022 Scottie Barnes Forward Toronto Raptors 2021 LaMelo Ball Guard Charlotte Hornets 2020 Ja Morant Guard Memphis Grizzlies 2019 Luka Don\u010di\u0107 Guard\/Forward Dallas Mavericks 2018 Ben Simmons Forward\/Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2017 Malcolm Brogdon Guard Milwaukee Bucks 2016 Karl-Anthony Towns Center Minnesota Timberwolves 2015 Andrew Wiggins Forward\/Guard Minnesota Timberwolves 2014 Michael Carter-Williams Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2013 Damian Lillard Guard Portland Trail Blazers 2012 Kyrie Irving Guard Cleveland Cavaliers 2011 Blake Griffin Forward Los Angeles Clippers 2010 Tyreke Evans Guard\/Forward Sacramento Kings\nWhat other NBA futures can I bet on?\nRookie of the Year is not the only form of NBA futures betting. Legal online sportsbooks have a wide selection of NBA futures you can bet on, including:\nIn addition to futures bets, you can wager on many NBA bets during the regular season and postseason. NBA game lines (moneylines, point spreads, and totals) are the most popular, but you\u2019ll also be able to bet on NBA team and player props, parlays, and more.\nThe NBA is the second-most popular odds market to bet on in the US, behind NFL betting odds.

{"title":"West Indies v England: first T20 international \u2013 live","context":"## West Indies v England: first T20 international \u2013 live\n\n13 Dec 2023 02.36 GMT James Wallace That\u2019s it from me this evening\/morning. Time to haul myself out of the OBO armchair and skulk off for some kip. That was an intriguing game and sets up this T20I series nicely. A real statement has been laid down by Rovman Powell and his men, West Indies were up against it early doors with England crunching their way to 112-2 off the first ten overs but Jos Buttler\u2019s side only managed to make 59 runs off the next ten, losing eight wickets along the way. A total of 171 was thirty or more shy of where England would have liked to have ended up and so it proved as West Indies peeled up their sleeves and showed how muscular their own batting card is \u2013 the home side cleared the ropes fourteen times compared to England\u2019s six. Andre Russell and Rovman Powell found the stands with ease at the business end of the match to get West Indies over the line with eleven balls remaining. We\u2019ll be back to cover the second match in Grenada on Thursday, do join us for that. Until then, thank you and goodnight.\nUpdated at 02.36 GMT\n13 Dec 2023 02.28 GMT Andre Russell is Player of the Match: In his first T20I in over two years he took 3-29 and smashed 29* off just 14 deliveries with the game in the balance. He seems very pleased to be back in maroon. Life is so funny. Since when I got selected for the West Indies two weeks ago I\u2019ve been dreaming of being man of the match.\u201d\n\n13 Dec 2023 02.09 GMT West Indies win by 4 wickets! Andre Russell smashes the winning runs off Sam Curran! A length ball is spanked over point for a one bounce four to give the home side the win, they go 1-0 up in the series.\nUpdated at 02.29 GMT\n13 Dec 2023 02.07 GMT 18th over: West Indies 168-6 (Powell 31, Russell 25) Adil Rashid is recalled for his final over, can he turn the game back to England? Nope. ANDRE RUSSELL SMASHES THE RASHID GOOGLY CLEAN OUT OF THE GROUND! Huge SIX! The big man even allows himself a coy smile. He enjoyed that one. A dot the next ball is followed by a powerful drive all along the baize for four! Eleven in total off the over and West Indies now just need four runs.\n\n13 Dec 2023 02.01 GMT 17th over: West Indies 157-6 (Powell 31, Russell 14) Tymal Mills is entrusted. Singles off the first two balls. Powell swipes a full ball into the deep to collect a couple. SIX! Mills goes short and Powell gets a mighty top edge for a maximum! Fortune favours the brave, the Windies skipper gave that everything and it could have gone anywhere. Mills sends one down the leg side \u2013 wide ball. Pressure on the bowler here\u2026 Shot! Short and wide from Mills and sent to the fence with Swiss clock timing by Powell. Sixteen off the over, looking terminal for Buttler and co. 15 needed from 18 balls.\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.55 GMT 16th over: West Indies 141-6 (Powell 26, Russell 4) Livingstone continues. Four singles off the first four balls keeps the pressure on the West Indies. HOLD THAT THOUGHT. Rovman Powell crunches consecutive sixes down the ground with a shrug and swagger to make it sixteen off the over. The scales tip once more, England need to do away with one or both of Powell and Russell \u2013 there\u2019s no way they don\u2019t win this for West Indies if they are there at the end. 31 needed from 24 balls.\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.51 GMT 15th over: West Indies 125-6 (Powell 12, Russell 2) Andre Russell the man to face the hattrick ball\u2026 Boo! A decent ball on the stumps is patted back by the big man. Drama in Barbados, Russell works for a couple. Ahmed takes his cap with a broad smile on his face \u2013 he hasn\u2019t had it all his own way but finishes with 3-39 from his set of four. Advantage England? 47 needed from 30 balls.\nUpdated at 01.54 GMT\n13 Dec 2023 01.47 GMT WICKET! Shepherd c Curran b Rehan Ahmed 0 (West Indies 123-6) Rehan Ahmed on a hattrick! Buttler brings Curran into slip and Shepherd pokes a leggie to him off his very first ball. Great stuff from Rehan who has turned the game England\u2019s way in the space of a minute.\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.45 GMT WICKET! Shai Hope c Brook b Rehan Ahmed 36 (West Indies 123-5) Ahmed is bunted for SIX by Shai Hope but strikes with the next ball as Hope holes out!\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.44 GMT 14th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 27, Powell 10) Liam Livingstone instead of Rashid and he does well to keep it to singles, England trying to take this as deep as possible and hope West Indies fluff their lines at the death. West Indies need 55 from 36 balls.\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.41 GMT 13th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 27, Powell 10) Rehan has two balls left to complete his over. The first ball is flayed for four by Powell behind point! Valuable runs for West Indies. Rehan\u2019s final ball is a dot, defended by Powell into the off side. West Indies need 60 from 42 balls.\nUpdated at 01.42 GMT\n13 Dec 2023 01.30 GMT Simon Burnton is our man in Barbados and he sends good news! \u201cIt\u2019s a 9.35pm restart. We haven\u2019t lost any overs.\u201d We should be underway in about eight minutes. I believe that 10.10pm local time is the cut off for the match \u2013 that\u2019ll be 2.10am here in London town. Excuse me whilst I head to the kitchen to microdose some Kenco.\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.14 GMT Promising news \u2013 the rain seems to be tailing off and a rope is being dragged around the outfield to take off any excess water. I\u2019ll bring news as soon as it wafts over from Barbados to my sofa.\n\n13 Dec 2023 01.00 GMT Rain stops play (West Indies 108-4 and require 64 runs off 44 balls) What\u2019s all this then? Out of nowhere the heavens crack like an inky br\u00fbl\u00e9e and rain starts to pour. The players scurry off as the covers are hauled on. Crucially \u2013 West Indies are six runs ahead of the Duckworth Lewis Stern rate. IF the rain doesn\u2019t abate \u2013 and it looks heavy at the moment \u2013 then the home side will take the spoils. 12.4 overs: West Indies 108-4 (Hope 27, Powell 6)\nUpdated at 01.09 GMT\n13 Dec 2023 00.58 GMT 12th over: West Indies 102-4 (Hope 26, Hetmyer 1) Just a single and the wicket off the over, Shai Hope can\u2019t break the legspin shackles. Windies skipper Rovman Powell is the new man and Buttler cranks the pressure by inserting a slip.\nUpdated at 01.04 GMT\n13 Dec 2023 00.52 GMT WICKET! Hetmyer c Duckett b Rashid 1 (West Indies 101-4) Adil Rashid takes his 100th T20I wicket! A crucial one in the context of the game too \u2013 the dangerous Hetmyer is sent on his way for just a single as England look to ramp up the pressure heading into the nub end of this match. Hetmyer danced out of his crease and got a good piece of the length ball but it flew flat and hard to Duckett on the midwicket sponge. And he does it on his 100th T20I appearance! \ud83d\udcaf#BBCCricket #WIvENG pic.twitter.com\/LYhUBtNnUj \u2014 Test Match Special (@bbctms) December 13, 2023\nUpdated at 01.02 GMT\n13 Dec 2023 00.49 GMT WICKET! Pooran c & b Rehan Ahmed 13 (West Indies 100-3) Rehan back into the attack after his first over was minced for n n n n nineteen. Got him! Pooran flicks back a full ball and Rehan takes a nifty catch tumbling away to his left. Shimron Hetymer is the new batter and he tucks a single into the leg side to open his account. The wicket has given Ahmed a confidence boost and he gets out of the over with three dots. 11th over: West Indies 101-3 (Hope 25, Hetmyer 1)\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.43 GMT 10th over: West Indies 99-2 (Hope 25, Pooran 13) Rashid is given another after his excellent first over. The googly is spotted by Pooran and driven down the ground handsomely for SIX! A glide behind point bring a single, Hope returns the favour with a flick into the leg side. A short ball is panned into the deep by Pooran for a couple to end the over. Bon Jovi O\u2019clock \u2013 West Indies need 73 from 60. Time for a quick slurp for the players and a knuckle stretch for me. Is there anybody alive out there?!\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.37 GMT 9th over: West Indies 87-2 (Hope 23, Pooran 3) Will the wickets slow the Windies as they did England? Rehan is replaced by Tymal Mills who starts with another wide. Rusty stuff so far from the southpaw seamer. That\u2019s better \u2013 a series of slower balls and back of the hand trickery restricts Pooran and Hope before the final ball is top edged over Buttler\u2019s head for a one bounce four. West Indies need 85 from 66 balls.\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.32 GMT WICKET! Kyle Mayers c Brook b Rashid 35 (West Indies 79-3) The sorcerer follows his apprentice and bags a wicket first ball! That\u2019s Rashid\u2019s 99th T20I wicket \u2013 in truth it was a bit of a drag down but from the front of the hand so it skidded onto Mayers who didn\u2019t time it and was caught by Brook in the deep. England needed that BIG TIME. A masterclass from Rashid in the rest of the over, Nicholas Pooran is the new man and his clip for one is the only run from the over. 8th over: West Indies 79-2 (Hope 19, Pooran 1)\nUpdated at 00.56 GMT\n13 Dec 2023 00.28 GMT 7th over: West Indies 78-1 (Mayers 35, Hope 19) Rehan to Kyle Mayers. First ball is dragged down and launched over the midwicket boundary for SIX. Pressure on the young leggie. What a shot! Mayers holds the pose as he lofts a supreme drive down the ground for SIX more. Brutal elegance. Rehan comes back well with two sharply turning leggies. Bosh! Shai Hope gets in on the act and smears a length ball over mid on for the third six of the over. It\u2019s a learning curve for the tyro spinner but that doesn\u2019t make it any less bruising.\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.23 GMT 6th over: West Indies 59-1 (Mayers 22, Hope 13) Curran is called back, Mills granted just the one over for the time being. Two slower balls bring two soothing dots for England. A single each to Mayers and Hope. Curran does very well to get out of the over with just three runs conceded. Powerplay complete. How long till we see some spin from Rehan? Not long at all, he\u2019s on for the next over.\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.20 GMT 5th over: West Indies 56-1 (Mayers 20, Hope 12) Woakes continues, after five balls he\u2019s gone for just three runs. Can he get out of the over cheaply? No \u2013 A length ball is clubbed down the ground for SIX with a minimum of fuss by Shai Hope. West Indies have come out of the traps as well as England did, one over of the Powerplay left.\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.16 GMT 4th over: West Indies 47-1 (Mayers 18, Hope 5) Tymal Mills comes onto bowl for England for the first time in eighteen months, he has plenty of T20 skills up his sleeve, can he showcase them here? Hmmm, a couple of wides slanted down the leg side isn\u2019t the best of starts. Mills lets out a hearty groan at the second. Two full balls are worked for singles\u2026 Kablammo! Mills to Mayers \u2013 short ball \u2013 pulled onto the roof for SIX! What a shot, new ball please! DROP! And it is Ben Duckett who shells it! It would have been even better than the first grab but the ball smashes into his palm as he leaps to his right and comes straight out. They stick or they don\u2019t. It\u2019s all happening.\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.10 GMT 3rd over: West Indies 36-1 (Mayers 10, Hope 4) Shai Hope is the new man and digs out a Woakes yorker and somehow manages to crunch it away down the ground for four. The replay of the Duckett catch is extremely enjoyable, Woakes owes him one for that as it was a poor ball outside off stump.\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.07 GMT WICKET! Brandon King c Duckett b Woakes 22 (West Indies 32-1) Chris Woakes into the attack to replace the beleaguered Sam Curran. OH. MY. LORDY. Ben Duckett flies to his left at backward point to pull off a spectacular diving catch off a full blooded cut shot from King. Stunner!\n\n13 Dec 2023 00.03 GMT 2nd over: West Indies 30-0 (King 21, Mayers 9) Will Jacks to bowl his workmanlike spin at the other end. Uh-Oh! He drops short and Kyle Mayers murders it, the ball lands on the roof of the stadium. That deserved everything it got. Mayers cuts for three behind point and then King skips jauntily out of his crease to skim the ball for four down the ground!\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.59 GMT 1st over: West Indies 16-0 (King 16, Mayers) Brandon King gets the home side off to a blistering start, sending Sam Curran down the ground for four and swiping a brace of SIXES over mid-wicket. Game on!\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.56 GMT No sooner have I sploshed some water on me teabag\u2026 the players emerge. West Indies need 172 to win!\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.48 GMT An innings of two halves for England From 77 for no loss to 171 all out with three balls to spare. England's recent white ball approach is a variable one yielding mixed...often frustrating results #WIvENG \u2014 Aatif Nawaz (@AatifNawaz) December 12, 2023\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.47 GMT Time to stick the kettle on and raid the fridge before West Indies start their chase. 3-19 for Andre Russell on his comeback for West Indies, balancing the attack perfectly.\n\nRussell at his best adds so much to West Indies's side. With him at 7, and Holder, Shepherd and Hosein to follow, West Indies bat incredibly deep \u2014 Tim Wigmore (@timwig) December 12, 2023\nUpdated at 23.48 GMT\n12 Dec 2023 23.46 GMT England all out 171! Tymal Mills gets a gossamer thin edge through to Pooran and England are all out with three deliveries to spare! What a turnaround for West Indies who were staring down the barrel with England flying 77-0 after six overs.\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.44 GMT WICKET! Rashid b Joseph 0 (England 170-9) Rashid goes to swipe Joseph in the final over and hacks the ball onto his timbers. England nine down\u2026\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.42 GMT WICKET! Ahmed c Powell b Russell 1 (England 169-8) Rehan Ahmed follows shortly after, trying to smear a length ball down the ground he can only find Powell lurking ten yards in from the sponge. Russell gets two in the over and finishes his spell and his first T20I in two years with figures of 3-19. Nicely done. 19th over: England 169-8 (Woakes 2, Rashid 0)\n\n12 Dec 2023 23.37 GMT WICKET! Livingstone b Russell 27 (England 167-7) Livingstone chops a cutter from Russell onto his stumps!\n\n\nThis article, authored by James Wallace, was published by The Guardian on 2023-12-12 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":63}

It was a fantastic bowling effort; we did well to hang in the game as long as we did. Phil Salt has had a brilliant series. We found out lots about ourselves as a team. [On the stop-clock experiment] It was only in the last game that we really noticed it. It\u2019s good to keep the game moving.\n\n6d ago 23.19 GMT England\u2019s miserable white-ball year ends with another series defeat. Plenty of good has come from this series, though, most notably the performance of Phil Salt. While there are a few slots to fill, most notably at No3, they are in reasonable shape ahead of nexr year\u2019s World Cup.\nUpdated at 23.20 GMT\n6d ago 23.16 GMT I suppose it\u2019s appropriate that it ended with a six, the 120th of the series. Hope played a gem of an innings there, calmly anchoring West Indies in an increasingly nervous chase with a run-a-ball 43. England fought admirably to defend a below-par total; but for Hope, they would probably have done it.\nUpdated at 23.17 GMT\n6d ago 23.14 GMT WEST INDIES WIN THE SERIES 3-2! 19.2 overs: West Indies 133-6 (Hope 43, Holder 4) That\u2019s it!

It would have been four but for an outstanding stop from Rehan Ahmed.\n\n6d ago 23.12 GMT 19th over; West Indies 124-6 (Hope 37, Holder 1) Holder is almost run out first ball! He took a very dodgy single to mid-off and was well short of the crease when Curran just failed to gather Rashid\u2019s throw. Nine to win from six balls, Chris Woakes to bowl them.\n\n6d ago 23.10 GMT WICKET! West Indies 123-6 (Russell c Livingstone b Curran 3) Oh my. Russell slugs a low full toss straight down the throat of Livingstone at long-on, and England \u2013 who have been behind the game throughout this innings \u2013 are again dreaming of an improbable victory. West Indies need 10 from 7 balls.\n\n6d ago 23.09 GMT 18.4 overs: West Indies 123-5 (Hope 37, Russell 3) Sam Curran concedes only one run from the first four balls of a superb penultimate over. The ball is getting very wet, though, so there\u2019s a short break in play while England call for a dry towel. West Indies need 10 from 8 balls.\n\n6d ago 23.04 GMT 18th over: West Indies 122-5 (Hope 36, Russell 3) Jos Buttler gambles by continuing with Rehan Ahmed, who has been relatively expensive. It doesn\u2019t come off: Hope skims a back cut between short third and backward point for four to move the requirement back below a run a ball. It\u2019s very hard to see how England can with this now.\n\n6d ago 23.00 GMT 17th over: West Indies 114-5 (Hope 30, Russell 1) The wicket England really need is that of Shai Hope, who is quietly guiding West Indies towards the finish line.\n\n6d ago 22.57 GMT WICKET! West Indies 113-5 (Powell c Rashid b Topley 8) England haven\u2019t given this up. Powell edges Topley to short third man, where Rashid takes a smart low catch to his left. West Indies need 20 from 21 balls. Reece Topley (right) celebrates the dismissal of Rovman Powell. Photograph: Randy Brooks\/AFP\/Getty Images\nUpdated at 23.07 GMT\n6d ago 22.54 GMT 16th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 29, Powell 8) Hope, who is playing an exemplary innings, opens the face to steer Rehan for his first boundary. Rehan has struggled as the series has progressed, an d later in the over Powell muscles him over long-on for six. West Indies are 21 runs away from a hat-trick of T20 series wins this year: South Africa away, India and England at home.\n\n6d ago 22.50 GMT 15th over: West Indies 99-4 (Hope 23, Powell 1) Rashid finishes with figures of 4-0-21-2. He\u2019s had a great series: eight wickets at 15 with an absurd economy rate of 6.26. But he\u2019s going to end on the losing side.\n\n6d ago 22.48 GMT WICKET! West Indies 95-4 (Rutherford c Curran b Rashid 30) Buttler brings back Rashid for his final over, knowing it\u2019s now or never for England, and gets an immediate reward. Rutherford smashes a drive towards short extra, where Curran dives to his left to take a superb catch. It\u2019s not the despair, Laura\u2026\n\n6d ago 22.45 GMT 14th over: West Indies 94-3 (Hope 19, Rutherford 30) West Indies are rushing towards a series victory. Rutherford hooks the new bowler Sam Curran for six more, and there are 11 from the over in total. Rutherford has 30 from 23 balls, Hope 19 from 28. They\u2019re playing their roles to perfection.\n\n6d ago 22.40 GMT 13th over: West Indies 83-3 (Hope 17, Rutherford 21) Rehan Ahmed returns, perhaps in the hope of tempting Rutherford into one big shot too many. Instead it\u2019s Shai Hope, who is happily playing the anchor role, who faces five of the six deliveries. England are running out of time.\n\n6d ago 22.37 GMT 12th over: West Indies 80-3 (Hope 15, Rutherford 20) England appeal unsuccessfully for caught behind when Rutherford misses a swipe at Rashid. There\u2019s only one review left and they decide not to risk it. A good job too; there was nothing on UltraEdge. Out of nothing Rutherford launches a full ball from Rashid down the ground for six, almost knocking himself off his feet in the process. West Indies are managing an awkward chase pretty well.\n\n6d ago 22.33 GMT 11th over: West Indies 71-3 (Hope 14, Rutherford 12) After 23 balls without a West Indian boundary, Rutherford lifts Moeen handsomely over extra cover for four. That\u2019s an excellent shot which keeps West Indies in control of the run-chase.\nUpdated at 22.33 GMT\n6d ago 22.28 GMT 10th over: West Indies 62-3 (Hope 12, Rutherford 5) West Indies know how dangerous Rashid is and are content to sit on him. I think that was Charles\u2019 plan as well, but then he saw a low full toss and his brain went rogue. Time for drinks, after which West Indies need 71 from 60 balls.\n\n6d ago 22.25 GMT Rutherford is not out! I need someone else\u2019s glasses: it was comfortably missing leg stump and England have lost a review.\n\n6d ago 22.25 GMT ENGLAND REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST RUTHERFORD! This looks really close. Rutherford pushed around a legbreak from Rashid and was hit on the pad in front of middle and leg.\n\n6d ago 22.24 GMT 9th over: West Indies 58-3 (Hope 11, Rutherford 2) Moeen replaces Rehan and rushes through a pretty good over, four singles from it. West Indies are still on top but another wicket would make things very interesting.\n\n6d ago 22.21 GMT WICKET! West Indies 54-3 (Charles c Buttler b Rashid 27) Adil Rashid strikes straight away. On this occasion it had nothing to do with his bowling, but maybe a little to do with his aura. He accidentally bowled a very wide, dipping full toss to Charles, who clunked it low to Jos Buttler at short extra cover. Adil Rashid (right) celebrates the dismissal of Johnson Charles (left).

This year marks a decade since serious complications from the flu led to a life-changing loss for the Virginia-based communications director.\nHAVE A COLD OR FLU? HERE'S HOW TO KNOW IF YOU CAN STILL WORK OUT: \u2018USE THE NECK CHECK\u2019\nAt age 33, Miller was a healthy young woman when she came down with a sore throat and headache.\nWhen her symptoms got worse, she went into urgent care for a chest X-ray, but it showed nothing alarming.\n\"It looked like it was just some sort of run-of-the-mill stuff \u2014 they gave me some prescription cough syrup and said to let them know if it got worse,\" she said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\nBack at home that night, Miller started feeling worse \u2014 and began having intense back pain .\n\"Thinking it was the flu or something I could get over, I kept waiting to turn the corner \u2014 like, this is the worst of it. It'll get better. And clearly that wasn't the case,\" she said.\nSKELETONS FROM 1918 FLU PANDEMIC REVEAL CLUES ABOUT THOSE MOST LIKELY TO DIE, STUDY FINDS\nThe next morning, when the back pain was causing her to have periodic blackouts, Miller managed to call a friend, who came over and called an ambulance.\nThat\u2019s where Miller's memory stops.\n\"I remember being loaded into the ambulance \u2014 and then I really don't remember a whole lot after that for about three weeks to a month thereafter,\" she said. \"It just escalated very quickly.\"\nAs Miller would later learn, her influenza had caused bilateral bacterial pneumonia \u2014 which affects both lungs and is more severe than viral pneumonia.\nThis led to sepsis, which quickly turned to septic shock.\n\"All of my organs were shutting down,\" Miller said. \"Within a short amount of time, I was in the ICU and they were doing everything they could. But ultimately, my last best chance was to be put on life support.\"\n\"I had missed the memo that flu vaccines were for everyone, and being 33 at the time and otherwise healthy, it didn't even register as something I should consider doing.\"\nAfter five days, Miller experienced a rare complication.\n\"A known complication of that form of life support is amputation,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Some patients lose blood circulation, and that's what happened to me.\"\nUltimately, doctors had to amputate Miller\u2019s left leg above the knee \u2014 all while she was still in a medically induced coma.\n\"By the time I came out of it, it had been three weeks. I awoke in a very hazy position \u2014 and I didn\u2019t have a left leg,\" she recalled.\nShe spent another two months in the hospital and then had to do weeks of inpatient rehabilitation.\nToday, in what Miller refers to as her \"new normal,\" she wears a prosthesis and \u2014 with the help of \"very qualified people\" \u2014 has learned to walk again and to \"navigate the world and all of its terrain.\"\nDOCTORS URGE VACCINATIONS AHEAD OF THIS YEAR'S FLU SEASON, WHICH COULD BE 'FAIRLY BAD,' EXPERTS SAY\nMiller has been able to get back to the things that she loves to do, such as traveling the world, without feeling limited by her disability.\n\"It's just different, and I have learned to adapt and adjust,\" she said.\nIn addition to the amputation, Miller still suffers from permanent lung damage and below-average heart function .\n\"There was some permanent organ damage because of the strain of the virus, as it was such a severe case of pneumonia,\" she said. \"I have a terminal lung condition that needs regular treatment.\"\nShe added, \"It's manageable, but it's something I will forever deal with.\"\nThe experience has given Miller a \"renewed sense of how quickly things could change\" \u2014 and has taught her to be as proactive as possible about her health to prevent a terrible outcome.\n\"A viral illness like influenza can set you up for something more serious further on.\"\nOverall, Miller said she thinks most people don\u2019t understand how severe the flu can be \u2014 so they don\u2019t recognize the signs that they need immediate medical attention .\n\"In my case, it was very quick \u2014 it was within 24 to 48 hours that it went from just coming on, to me being in the hot seat.\"\nNow, Miller is looking to spread awareness of the importance of getting the flu vaccine, which she did not get that year.\n\"I had missed the memo that flu vaccines were for everyone, and being 33 at the time and otherwise healthy, it didn't even register as something I should consider doing,\" she said.\n\"If there's anything you can do proactively to minimize the risk of something that severe happening to you, you absolutely should do it, I think.\"\nFLU PREVENTION TIPS FROM FLORIDA'S SURGEON GENERAL: A 'DAY-TO-DAY\u2019 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE IS KEY\nMiller acknowledges that the vaccine doesn\u2019t guarantee that someone won't get the flu, but noted that \"it's more of a continuum, rather than either you're sick or you're not.\"\nShe said, \"You still might get it, but you may not end up in the ICU like I did \u2026 Considering the benefits that you could get and what the extreme, worst outcome could be, it is an easy thing to do that is proven to make a tremendous difference for people,\" she added.\nIn addition to getting yearly vaccines, Miller takes steps to minimize her exposure and makes healthy lifestyle choices , such as eating nutritious foods and exercising.\nDr. Gregg Sylvester, chief health officer at CSL Seqirus, a New Jersey biopharmaceutical company, noted that while Miller\u2019s experience is not typical of most women in her age range, \"it probably occurs more often than we know.\"\nThe flu triggers inflammation of the respiratory tract, Sylvester said, which causes it to become irritated and can allow secondary or bacteria to enter.\nCOVID-19, FLU AND RSV VACCINES ARE ALL AVAILABLE THIS FALL: SEE WHAT SOME DOCTORS RECOMMEND AND WHY\n\"A viral illness like influenza can set you up for something more serious further on,\" he warned. \"That's why it's so important to get a vaccine.\"\nThe more severe complications of flu often are markedly reduced for those who get an influenza vaccine, according to the doctor.\n\"You still may end up getting infected , but your symptoms will be milder,\" he said. \"And hopefully, your respiratory tract will be in a little bit better shape.\"\nMid-October is the \"perfect time\" to get a flu vaccine, Sylvester said, as he noted that the U.S. is starting to see an upswing in cases.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"It's never too late, but it is important to be vaccinated before the season really gets started,\" he said.\nOverall, Miller urged, \"don't dismiss the flu as just the flu.

Listen to your body \u2014 it\u2019s better to go in proactively, rather than regret it later.\"\nSylvester agreed, stressing the need for people to be their own patient advocates.\n\"It's important to seek care early, especially if symptoms start to change dramatically,\" he said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDuring the 2021-2022 influenza season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were nine million illnesses, four million medical visits, 10,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths related to the flu.\nThe CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every season, with rare exceptions.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-10-18 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":65}
{"title":"Ozempic, Wegovy may be linked to stomach paralysis and other digestive issues in large-scale study","context":"## Ozempic, Wegovy may be linked to stomach paralysis and other digestive issues in large-scale study\n\nPopular weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic could increase the risk of stomach paralysis as well as several other serious gastrointestinal conditions , according to a study published Thursday in JAMA.\nThis was the first large epidemiological (disease-related) study to examine these adverse effects in non-diabetic patients using the drugs specifically for weight loss, per a press release from The University of British Columbia (UBC).\nThe risk was linked to all semaglutides, a class of medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists \u2014 including Ozempic (prescribed for diabetes management ), Wegovy (prescribed for weight loss), Rybelsus (type 2 diabetes) and Saxenda (weight loss).\nOZEMPIC DIABETES AND WEIGHT LOSS MEDICATION UNDER INVESTIGATION AFTER A FEW REPORTS OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS\nStomach paralysis, officially known as gastroparesis, prevents the nerves and muscles in the stomach from moving food into the small intestine, which keeps digestion from occurring, as described on Cleveland Clinic\u2019s website.\nIn addition to stomach paralysis, the drugs were linked to a greater risk of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and bowel obstruction, which prevents food from passing through the small or large intestine, the release stated.\nUBC researchers examined the health insurance claim records for approximately 16 million U.S. patients who were prescribed Ozempic, Wegovy or either semaglutide or liraglutide medications across a 14-year span (between 2006 and 2020).\nThe researchers could not assess whether the condition was temporary or permanent.\nCompared to another weight loss drug , bupropion-naltrexone, those who took a GLP-1 agonist were 3.67 times more likely to develop stomach paralysis, had a 9.09 times higher risk of pancreatitis and were 4.22 times more likely to have bowel obstruction.\nOZEMPIC, WEGOVY AND ALL THOSE CRAZY, VIVID DREAMS: IS THERE A CONNECTION?\nFor the cases of stomach paralysis, the researchers could not assess whether the condition was temporary or permanent.\n\"There are reports from other journalists where they have met patients whose symptoms have not gone away despite stopping the drugs,\" study co-author Dr. Mahyar Etminan, associate professor in the Departments of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences and Medicine at UBC, told Fox News Digital.\nThere are medications that can be used to help with the condition, he added.\nAlthough these complications were rare, the researchers found them concerning, given that millions of people are using these medications worldwide.\nThe number of people in the U.S. using GLP-1 agonists for either diabetes or obesity reached 40 million in 2022, they noted.\n\"These drugs are becoming increasingly accessible, and it is concerning that, in some cases, people can simply go online and order these kinds of medications when they may not have a full understanding of what could potentially happen,\" said first author Mohit Sodhi, a graduate of UBC\u2019s experimental medicine program, in the release.\nThe number of people in the U.S. using GLP-1 agonists for either diabetes or obesity reportedly reached 40 million in 2022.\n\"Given the wide use of these drugs, these adverse events, although rare, must be considered by patients thinking about using them for weight loss.\"\nThe researchers recommend that regulatory agencies and drugmakers consider updating the warning labels for their products, which currently don\u2019t include the risk of gastroparesis.\n\"This is critical information for patients to know so they can seek timely medical attention and avoid serious consequences,\" said Sodhi.\nThe decision about whether to take the drug in spite of these risks will depend on each patient\u2019s individual situation, the researchers said.\n\"This decision should be individually assessed,\" said Etminan. \"There are patients where the benefit of the drugs might outweigh the risks (very obese individuals), whereas in other situations (healthy individuals who just want to lose a few pounds), the risks might outweigh the benefits.\"\n\"This is critical information for patients to know so they can seek timely medical attention and avoid serious consequences.\"\nThe study did have some limitations, the researchers noted.\n\"We did not have access to medical charts to ascertain all subjects' medical histories,\" said Etminan. \"Also, we could not look at risk with individual GLP-1 drugs, but this is probably a class effect of these drugs.\"\nOZEMPIC-WEGOVY PILL MAY BE ON THE WAY: TRIAL SHOWS PROMISING RESULTS FOR NEW WEIGHT LOSS TABLET\nThe researchers also did not determine whether certain groups were at higher risk of this adverse side effect, but Etminan said he suspects that those with preexisting GI conditions might be more susceptible.\nCalifornia-based cardiologist Dr. Ernst von Schwarz, author of \"The Secrets of Immortality,\" was not involved in the study but noted that it confirmed a higher prevalence of pancreatitis, gastroparesis and bowel obstruction in patients on GLP-1 agonists.\n\"On the other hand, these drugs have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events as shown for Ozempic in 2016 in diabetics and in 2023 for Wegovy,\" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\"The achieved weight loss using GLP-1 agonists, as well as the improved glucose control, seem to have significant benefits on cardiovascular outcomes, but patients need to be informed about the relatively small incidence of abdominal side effects as seen in this cohort study,\" said von Schwarz.\n\"The benefits on cardiovascular risks , however, appear to outweigh the risks of side effects.\"\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists \"ileus\" as a potential side effect of Ozempic.\nIleus is the inability of the intestine (bowel) to contract normally and move waste out of the body, according to Mayo Clinic.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nIn August, a Louisiana woman sued Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy, and Lilly, which makes another GLP-1 agonist, Mounjaro, claiming that the companies \"downplayed the severity of gastrointestinal events caused by Ozempic and Mounjaro \u2014 never, for example, warning of the risk of gastroparesis (\u2018paralyzed stomach\u2019) or gastroenteritis.\"\nThe woman, who used Ozempic for more than a year before switching to Mounjaro last month, alleged she was \"severely injured as a result\" of using both drugs, the suit stated.\nIn a statement at the time, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk told FOX Business that gastrointestinal events \"are well-known side effects of the GLP-1 class\" and \"are mild to moderate in severity and of short duration.\"\n\"Given the wide use of these drugs, these adverse events, although rare, must be considered by patients thinking about using them for weight loss.\"\nThe company provided the below statement to Fox News Digital on Friday, Oct. 6.\n\"At Novo Nordisk, patient safety is a top priority. We work closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to continuously monitor the safety profile of our medicines. The FDA-approved product labeling for Novo Nordisk\u2019s GLP-1RA medicines indicated for use in weight management (Saxenda and Wegovy) includes information about their potential side effects, including pancreatitis, acute gallbladder disease, ileus and delayed gastric emptying.\"\n\"Similar information is included in the product labeling for our GLP-1RA medicines indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Ozempic, Rybelsus and Victoza),\" the statement went on.\n\"Novo Nordisk stands behind the safety and efficacy of all of our GLP-1RA medicines when used consistent with the product labeling and approved indications.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNovo Nordisk continued, \"With respect to the study, as the authors acknowledge, the study has limitations, including potential confounding by indication and by other factors.\"\nThe company added, \"It is also important to note that the study analyzed data collected during the period between 2006 and 2020. During this time, Wegovy was not on the market; Saxenda was first approved in December 2014. In addition, Victoza was FDA-approved in January 2010 and Ozempic was FDA-approved in December 2017.\"\nDaniella Genovese of Fox News Digital contributed to this report.\n\nThis article was published by FOX News - Health on 2023-10-07 under the category 'health'.\n\n","id":66}

And as such celebrations are better with tasty treats to hand, The White Company has a range of homeware that makes sure you\u2019re always ready for the occasion whenever food or drink are called for. We love these Ferne Twisted Stem Champagne Coupes with their hand-twisted stems twinkling under the festive lights and the hand-blown glass providing an extra touch of class to whatever sparkling drinks you serve in them.\nFor handing round the drinks, canap\u00e9s or snacks to your guests we recommend this Barton Serving Tray. Its warm, silver-tone finish has wintery good looks, setting off whatever you\u2019re serving in style, while the high-quality aluminium, crafted in India, is durable enough to survive parties or energetic family play.\nEmbrace the magic of Christmas\n(The White Company)\nFrom counting down the days with an Advent calendar, to making your own decorations, or simply digging out your favourite festive fashions, the season is full of little moments that make Christmas so unique, so give yourself time to enjoy the wonder of it all.\nThis Snowy Advent Calendar will appeal to younger members of the family \u2013 a charming penguin with 25 numbered pockets that you\u2019ll have fun filling with treats and gifts.

Find time to relax with a long bath, treat yourself to a lie-in on Sunday morning or pour yourself a glass of wine as the log fire crackles in the background.\nThis Motion Sensor Plug In Electronic Diffuser is a great little gadget that delivers the ideal amount of relaxing scent at the touch of a button. Simply add your favourite scent oil and the motion-activated sensor helps you to control when it\u2019s released, providing a tranquil atmosphere in whatever room you choose to use it.\nWhen you find time to put your feet up, give your toes some extra comfort and warmth with a pair of Cashmere Bed Socks. They come in a range of colours to suit your style and are made from pure GCS-certified yarns to take the chill off your feet. And seeing as everyone loves cosy socks at Christmas, we think they\u2019re also a great choice for gifting.\nFor even more cosiness we think you should consider this Faux Fur Throw, made from soft and silky recycled fibres, and matching Soft Fur Hot Water Bottle. They give so much cuddle comfort on chilly winter evenings that you won\u2019t mind how long spring takes to come around.\nMix old traditions with new rituals\n(The White Company)\nWe all have traditions that are handed down through generations \u2013 things like opening the sloe gin after the last day of work or a ceremonial placing of the star on top of the Christmas tree. This year, why not start a new ritual such as a designated \u2018morning in bed\u2019 or an \u2018afternoon pyjama party\u2019, to make sure that Christmas is done your way.\nThe White Company has a range of nightwear that will add a touch of luxury to any lazy days. This Jersey Piped Printed Classic Pyjama Set will keep you comfortable from top to bottom, with its soft jersey-blend fabric inviting you to curl up in bed or on the sofa. Both the collared pyjama shirt and trousers are printed with tiny stars, adding a subtle sparkle to a festive snooze.\nFor most Christmas rituals, the Christmas tree takes centre stage and The White Company has got this covered too with a spectacular Pre Lit Grand Spruce Christmas Tree. Standing at 7.5ft tall its high quality faux foliage is an impressively natural-looking shade of green and in-built lights have various settings for a choice of lighting effects. It\u2019s also quick and easy to assemble and take down, leaving more time for those fun festive rituals.\nTime for the main event\u2026\n(The White Company)\nIt\u2019s the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for and, let\u2019s be honest, not everything will go to plan. There may be squabbles and you may not have got round to making your own Christmas pudding. But there\u2019s so much more to enjoy and you\u2019ll learn to appreciate that, whatever happens, your Christmas will be wonderful just the way it is.\nOf course, it\u2019s kids that make Christmas extra special, and with The Little White Company you\u2019ll find great gifts for the youngest members of the family besides those friends with newborns. We love their Jingles Reindeer Comforter which is made from recycled fibres and has a squidgy red nose and felt antlers for an all-over soft and soothing feel.\nThe White Company also has plenty of affordable gifts for grown ups that make great stocking fillers or presents for those surprise visitors. We suspect this Scent Stories Hamper will go down well with any recipient, with candles, hand wash, diffusers and more wrapped up in a hand-woven basket. The scents of myrrh, fir tree and Nordic wood will have your lucky recipient breathing in the magic of Christmas through a swirl of seasonal aromas.\nEnjoy the in-between days\n(The White Company)\nWe all lose track of time over Christmas, not sure what day it is or questioning if it\u2019s OK to eat mince pies and brandy butter for breakfast. But there\u2019s still plenty of time for fun and relaxation \u2013 a visit to see old friends, a quiet walk in the frosty woods and, of course, the fizz and sparkle of new year parties.\nTo help you get out of the house, even on the coldest mornings, this Down Filled Oversized Puffer Coat will keep you warm and help to make you look and feel great, despite the excesses of Christmas. Made from recycled fibres, and with a detachable hood filled, this down-filled quilted puffer will embrace you in a pillowy cuddle.\nWhen it comes to New Year\u2019s celebrations, you\u2019ll want to make sure your fizz is served in peak condition, ready for those corks to pop. This Champagne Trug is a party essential. Hand-soldered in nickel-plated stainless steel just fill it with ice and it will chill your Champagne to perfection. It also makes a great statement piece, announcing that yours is the place to go back to during the festive period and beyond.\nExplore more\n\nThis article, authored by , was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-10-13 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":68}

Once the clock strikes midnight on October 31st, Mariah Carey will defrost, peppermint mochas will inevitably return, and the 2023 holiday season will have officially begun.\nThankfully for those looking to get in the festive spirit, Govee\u2019s Matter-ready LED Strip Light M1 is on sale for an all-time low of $44.99 ($15 off) at Amazon when you clip the on-page coupon. You can also buy it for $3 more direct from Govee through October 31st, which is still one of its better prices to date.\nWhile handy throughout the year, Govee\u2019s 6.56-foot (2m) light strip is particularly convenient during Halloween and other holidays. Not only can the bright, tunable LEDs flash and blink to the beat of your music, but they can also act as a festive piece of decor that adds a pop of color to your holiday parties. What\u2019s particularly great about this strip, though, is that it supports the newer Matter protocol, which allows you to control the lights with a wide array of smart home platforms.\nGovee LED Strip Light M1 Matter $ 45 $ 60 25 % off $ 45 $ 45 $ 60 25 % off The customizable Govee M1 Matter Compatible LED Strip Light is 6.56 feet long and can display millions of colors and shades of white.

We\u2019re also fans because of all the other perks they offer, like multipoint connectivity, long battery life, and a good transparency mode. They deliver even more value to Pixel phone owners as well, who can enjoy exclusive access features like head tracking spatial audio and Google\u2019s Clear Calling, which reduces background noise during calls.\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel Buds Pro $ 117 $ 200 42 % off $ 117 $ 117 $ 200 42 % off Google\u2019s Pixel Buds Pro are the company\u2019s first earbuds to include active noise cancellation.

That\u2019s not bad considering Google\u2019s first-gen smartwatch retailed for $349.99 when it first launched a little over a year ago.\nThe first-gen Pixel Watch may not be as capable as the new Google Pixel Watch 2, but they have a number of strengths in common. Both offer health and fitness-tracking features powered by Fitbit, allowing you to enjoy special features like FDA-cleared EKGs. The wearables also support Google services like Google Assistant and Google Wallet. And now, thanks to the new Wear OS 4 update, you get access to the Google Calendar app, Gmail, and the new Safety Check feature introduced with the new wearable.\nThere are some trade-offs, though. The Pixel Watch 2 offers superior battery life, whereas the last-gen model struggles to last a full day. The newer wearable also sports some new tricks, including Sleep Profiles, abnormal heart rate tracking, and nightly SpO2 features. Nevertheless, if you\u2019re comfortable with these omissions, the first-gen model is still a good wearable to buy at this price.\nGoogle Pixel Watch $ 200 $ 350 43 % off $ 200 $ 200 $ 350 43 % off Google\u2019s first in-house smartwatch has a beautiful domed display and native Fitbit integration for health tracking.

However, if you want to keep track of all the ghosties and ghoulies that\u2019ll soon pay your front door a visit on Halloween, you can pick up the Blink Video Doorbell with the latest Blink Outdoor security camera on Amazon for just $89.99 ($90 off).\nBoth of the 1080p cameras come with tech that\u2019ll allow you to clearly see trick-or-treaters even after the sun goes down, in addition to support for motion detection and two-way audio. The battery-powered Blink Outdoor 4 also covers a wider field of view and supports person detection, which wasn\u2019t the case with the prior model.\nAs budget picks, they lack some premium features, including smart alerts. You\u2019ll also have to pay extra for features like cloud-based storage, though, otherwise, they\u2019re a pair of great security devices that\u2019ll protect your home just fine for years to come.\nBlink Video Doorbell (with Blink Outdoor 4) $ 90 $ 180 50 % off $ 90 $ 90 $ 180 50 % off Blink\u2019s Video Doorbell is the best if you\u2019re looking for a budget-friendly buzzer that offers motion-activated recording and alerts, night vision, two-way audio, and up to two years of battery life. $90 at Amazon\nVerge Deals on X (formerly known as Twitter) \/ Join more than 51,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals Follow us!\nSome more deals to kickstart your weekend\n\nThis article, authored by Sheena Vasani, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-28 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":69}

Relationship experts weigh in\n\nStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nIf you\u2019re in the midst of a new relationship this holiday season, you may be faced with the opportunity to introduce your significant other to your family. However, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve found yourself mulling over an array of reasons why the holidays may not be the right time for such an introduction.\nThe holiday season is often perceived as the most wonderful time of year, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case for everyone. In a recent poll from the American Psychological Association, 41 per cent of US adults said their stress levels increased from November to January when compared to other months of the year. Nearly 50 per cent of Americans also described their stress level during the season as \u201cmoderate\u201d.\nEveryone has different concerns leading up to Christmas, Hanukkah, or New Years - from family drama at the dinner table to a small spats with your mother about decorations. With what can be stressful events, it only begs the question: do you really want to bring your partner into the mix? While it\u2019s important to eventually introduce your loved ones to your significant other, relationship experts believe there are some discussions you should have beforehand, especially during the holidays.\nSpeaking to The Independent, Rachel Zar - a licensed marriage and family therapist at Spark Chicago Therapy - acknowledged that while every family is different, there\u2019s a variety of problems that could arise during the holiday season - mainly because we put too much pressure on having a joyful holiday. \u201cI think anytime that emotions are heightened, with the holidays certainly being one of those times, our expectations are really high,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting it to be this joyful, happy, perfect occasion. So, we sometimes forget that the holidays come with a lot of stress.\u201d\nDespite tensions between relatives at the dinner table, that doesn\u2019t mean your relationship shouldn\u2019t be celebrated. Saba Lurie is a licensed marriage and family therapist at Take Root Thereapy in California. She explained to The Independent that while there isn\u2019t a right or wrong time to introduce your partner to your family, the intentions of such an introduction must be clear. Not only should you have already discussed where your relationship is headed, but you should also tell your partner everything they need to know about your family.\n\u201cI think you should tell the person why you\u2019re bringing them home for the holidays, so you\u2019re on the same page about the intentions and what\u2019s motivating the decision to include,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it can be helpful for them to know about the dynamics that they\u2019re stepping into and how they can best support you. Frankly, they should be aware if there is tension or if there is stress within your family.\u201d\n(Getty Images)\nCommunication before the holidays goes both ways, and there are things that your family should know about your significant other too. \u201cIf there\u2019s something about your partner that could be surprising to your family, or that\u2019s a notable difference from who someone you\u2019ve brought home before, tell your relatives that,\u201d Zar said. \u201cLet\u2019s set your family and partner up for success.\u201d\nBefore bringing your significant other home for the holidays, you may want to express to your family how you wish for them to feel included - such as incorporating your partner\u2019s family traditions into your own celebration. However, Zar advised against oversharing information before Christmas. You still want your family and partner to connect in person, rather than hearing about each other through the grapevine.\nWhen it comes to introducing your partner to your family, there\u2019s still some extra planning to be done ahead of time. If you\u2019re travelling this month, you may need to decide on sleeping arrangements - as opposed to residing in your parent\u2019s house - in order to minimise family stress.\n\u201cIt would be really helpful to have conversations beforehand, so it\u2019s clear what you are agreeing or not agreeing to,\u201d Lurie explained. \u201cFor example, if your family isn\u2019t comfortable with you bringing someone home and sleeping in the same bedroom, then you and your partner may stay elsewhere. But those would be conversations that you all need to have together. It really depends on your relationship with your family and with your partner.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also important to be checking in with your partner while spending time with your family. These check-ins may include some quality time together, so that any family drama that may arise isn\u2019t hurting your relationship.\n\u201cI\u2019d recommend pulling your partner aside and saying: \u2018How are we doing?\u2019 Like a temperature check,\u201d she added. \u201cThose are points where the two of you can come and remind each other: \u2018We are a team in this.\u2019 Or, the two of you could go on a walk and separate from the family, just for a little bit of time to reset within the relationship.\u201d\nDuring the holiday season, your partner may be seeing how you interact with your family for the first time. But that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, according to the relationship experts. \u201cI think introducing a significant other to family is a really vulnerable act, and that vulnerability is going to be what allows for greater intimacy,\u201d Lurie said. \u201cWhen your significant other sees you with your family, they may see another side of you that they may not have had access to before.\u201d\n(Getty Images)\nOn the other hand, your partner could learn that your relationship with your parents and extended family members is complex. That isn\u2019t necessarily a cause for concern, as long as you inform your significant other about the interworkings of your family dynamics.\n\u201cI think that we tend to be our best relational self when we\u2019ve really done the work around understanding all of our past relationships,\u201d Zar explained. \u201cYou can tell your partner: \u2018I don\u2019t have a close relationship with my brother, and here\u2019s why. Here are the intentional choices that I\u2019ve made around it.\u2019 Or you can say: \u2018Here\u2019s my chosen family. These are the people who are important to me.\u2019 Your significant other will see that you\u2019ve been introspective and have takeaways around how you\u2019ve navigated your family\u2019s origin.\u201d\nAs long as you and your partner have discussed your relationship expectations - both before and during the holidays \u2013 introducing them to your family may deepen your relationship and could be a step in the right direction. Or, it could have a simpler meaning - the holidays being an opportunity to bring two important people in your life together and get to know each other.\nRegardless of what your relationship with your family is like, deciding how and when to introduce your partner to your loved ones is entirely up to you. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever going to be a perfect time for folks,\u201d Lurie said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll depend on the relationship between the two partners and also on the family dynamics, and what feels more comfortable for all parties. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a right or wrong time for the introduction.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-12-12 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":70}

The eight-time national champions have been led by legendary coach John Calipari since 2010 and they have appeared in four Final Fours during his tenure, recording a national title in 2012. The program's 2,021-637 all-time record is the best in college basketball history. Though best known for its basketball prowess, Kentucky has also found more success on the gridiron in recent years in the SEC, including a dozen bowl appearances since 2006.\nLouisville Cardinals: The Wildcats have the historic edge, but Louisville basketball won the more recent national title, cutting down the nets in 2013. They've been to 10 Final Fours and own the 12th-best record (1,726-874) in college basketball history. Louisville has also become a bigger name in the college football world in the past couple decades. Well known for 2013 Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, Louisville transitioned to the ACC in 2014 and the Cardinals have finished in the AP Top 25 seven times since 2004.\nWestern Kentucky Hilltoppers: Though they don't have the widespread following of UK or Louisville, the Hilltoppers have a nice fanbase in the southern portion of the state and they have the overall athletic success to demand attention in the betting market. A longtime Division I-AA (now known as FCS) power, WKU fully transitioned to the FBS level in 2009 and they've had nine winning seasons since that point. In men's basketball, WKU has made the NCAA Tournament 23 times and its 1,622-720 all-time mark ranks 14th in history, just a couple spots behind Louisville.\nCincinnati Bengals: With no \"Big Four\" professional sports teams playing within state lines, many Kentucky residents look just north of the state's border to cheer on the neighboring Cincinnati Bengals. A franchise long known for its futility in the early days of existence became more of a contender under Marvin Lewis with seven playoff appearances between 2005-15. The franchise got another jolt more recently with stars such as Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase leading Cincinnati to a Super Bowl appearance in 2021 and an AFC title game appearance in 2022. The Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans are also NFL franchises located within short drives of portions of Kentucky.\nCincinnati Reds: The state's MLB allegiances are a bit more split with the St. Louis Cardinals also drawing a big following, particularly in the western portion of the state, but the Reds are largely considered the most popular team for Kentucky residents. The Reds won modern-era titles in 1975, 1976 and 1990, but haven't advanced past the NLCS since that point. They've largely struggled in recent years, but the 2023 team has pushed for a playoff spot all season, just in time to draw the attention of new Kentucky sports bettors.\nTop Kentucky betting terms for new bettors\nAgainst the spread: Instead of betting on an exact winner, the widely-popular spread bet levels the playing field by allowing you to wager on how many points a team will win by. In basketball, if Kentucky is the 7.5-point favorite against Louisville then Kentucky can cover the spread if it wins by 8 or more points. However, Louisville as the 7.5-point underdog can cover the spread by winning outright or losing by 7 or fewer points.\nMoney line: Think of this as an elevated outright bet, with odds adjusted to reflect a favored team and an underdog. If Kentucky is listed as a -200 favorite against Florida, you'd need to bet $200 to return $100 on Kentucky to win. That means that Florida as the +200 underdog would return $200 on a $100 bet if that team wins.\nOutright bet: This is the easiest wager that can be placed, and it's perfect for betting on one of Kentucky's biggest sporting events: Horse racing. With an outright bet, bettors choose one athlete -- or thoroughbred -- to win an entire sporting event.\nOver\/Under: If team sports is more your thing, placing an Over\/Under bet is the way to go. Kentucky sportsbooks will post an estimated total of both team's final scores in a game, and you wager on whether the actual final will be higher or lower than the estimate. So if the If the Over\/Under for a Kentucky vs. Louisville basketball game is 125.5, you would wager on the final total being Over 126 or Under 125.\nPlayer prop: Kentucky is one of the 18 states that allows you to place prop bets on collegiate athletes. Sportsbooks will project what a player's stat will be at the end of a game, and you will wager whether the player will end that game over or under that projection. Popular player props include how many touchdown passes a quarterback will throw or how many three-point shots a basketball player will hit.\nUnderdog: The underdog is the team deemed less likely to win the game based on the odds. A bet on an underdog typically yields a larger return than a bet on the favorite.\nFavorite: On the other hand, a favorite is the team that is deemed more likely to win the game. Bettors often pay a premium for betting on a favorite but they're also the team that more often wins the game outright.\nConsensus odds: These odds are generally defined as an average of all available betting markets. Different sportsbooks may price markets variably based on the action they've taken or their own interpretation of information.\nFutures: While money line, against the spread and over\/under bets are all single-game bets, futures markets encompass almost anything that falls outside of that spectrum. Futures bets include total regular-season wins, championship odds, MVP odds and more.\nParlay: This popular betting style is a little more complex. A parlay requires you to include two or more bets within a single wager, and all of your bets must win for the parlay to be a winner. For example, if you wager $100 on a three-leg parlay at 6 to 1 odds, you could win $600 if all three legs of the bet are winners.\nJuice: Also known as \"The Vig\" or vigorish, juice is effectively the tax that oddsmakers charge for handling a wager. If a book determines a game is a virtual coinflip, they may price both options at -110 to give themselves a 10% rake on all the action.\nPush: A push is a bet where neither the bettor or the sportsbook wins. If an over\/under for total points in a football game is set at 44 and both teams combine to score exactly 44 points, the result is a push and the principle is returned to the bettor.\nLive\/in-game betting: Many sportsbooks now offer live\/in-game wagering that allows you to make bets on several different markets in real-time. In basketball, you can bet on the outcome of a quarter, individual statistics and live-updated spreads\/totals.\nYou can bet on sports in states like Ohio, New York, and Arizona.\n\nThis article, authored by CBS Sports Staff, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-10-13 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":71}

{"title":"Psagot worth 80% less since Rani Zim bought it","context":"## Psagot worth 80% less since Rani Zim bought it\n\nIn late August 2021, Rani Zim completed one of the more surprising moves in his meteoric business career when he bought Psagot Investment House for NIS 405 million from Altshuler Shaham.\nBefore that acquisition, Zim had made his fortune in food retailing, setting up, together with his brother Adi, the Kimat Hinam supermarket chain, which was sold in an impressive exit, and in income producing real estate, with the commercial centers company that bears his name.\nBut just over two years since the deal that was meant to move him up a league, Group Psagot for Finance and Investments (TASE: GPST), which holds the investment house that was once the biggest in Israel, has a market cap of just NIS 97 million, after a 75% decline in its share price in the past year, and an 80% since the acquisition.\n\"Rani and Psagot suffered from a lot of bad luck, because sometimes it\u2019s all a matter of timing,\" a senior capital markets source told \"Globes\". \"Since he bought Psagot, three significant things happened that affected the company. First of all, interest rates rose, and if there\u2019s one thing that a financial marker doesn\u2019t like, it\u2019s interest rate hikes, particularly in the case of a leveraged deal.\"\nTo finance the acquisition, Zim took a loan of NIS 255 million from Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, which he offloaded onto the acquired investment house. NIS 120 million is still outstanding.\n\"A second factor,\" the source continued, \"is the judicial overhaul promoted by the government in the first nine months of the year, which didn\u2019t exactly contribute to the financial markets, with a great deal of money leaving Israel. Psagot doesn\u2019t specialize in long-term savings, in which most of the money is invested outside Israel, but mainly in investment in the local market, in products such as portfolio management, mutual funds, and a little brokerage. These are investment channels that are very vulnerable when Israel takes a hit. Finally, the war that broke out on October 7 was a blow to the finance industry, certainly in the short term.\"\nNow, Group Psagot is setting out to raise NIS 220 million debt, to be secured by the company\u2019s shares in subsidiary Psagot Investment House. To that end, the company\u2019s management has held meetings in the past few days with several financial institutions, to present to them the investment house\u2019s activities and business plans. The sum that Group Psagot seeks to raise is intended both to cover the balance of its debt to Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, and to replace NIS 120 million in marketable bonds due for redemption in the coming eighteen months.\nThe existing bonds (series C) are currently traded at junk yields of around 16%, which makes it difficult to recycle the debt, hence the collateral required for the bonds to be offered. Group Psagot believes that, once the move is completed, the yield on its bonds will fall to single-digit proportions, and that its share price will rise accordingly.\n\"A rapid realization that it\u2019s not for him\"\nSo far, Zim has invested nearly NIS 130 million of his own capital in buying control of Psagot, including in a rights issue that the group made last summer. The 62% stake that Zim holds in Group Psagot, the public company (formerly called Value Capital) through which he bought the investment house, is currently worth just NIS 64 million, meaning that he lost about half his investment within a short time.\nImmediately after acquiring Psagot\u2019s business (which mainly consisted of management of mutual funds and customer portfolios) Zim told \"Globes\": \"Our headline at Psagot is to restore its former glory. We haven\u2019t come to make a killing in one or two years, and I don\u2019t want to start selling the business on to other entities\u2026 we\u2019ll invest in the people, in the activity, in the organization, in the market, and we\u2019ll form collaborations with many entities in the economy. We want to bring new activities and a different aroma to the market.\"\nBut, as reported six months ago, Zim has started to look for someone to buy his entire stake in the investment house, or at least part of it. One of the names mentioned in the press is that of Group Psagot CEO Yaniv Bender, who currently holds 7.4% of the company, as someone who could participate in such an acquisition.\nPsagot recently completed the sale of one third of its mutual funds business and its entire portfolio management business to Kessem, of The Phoenix Holdings group, for NIS 200 million. The sale of the mutual funds will yield a gain to Psagot of NIS 90 million, which will be posted in it fourth quarter financials. That amount is equivalent to the entire company\u2019s current market cap, which, if you will, means that the rest of its business is valued at zero.\n\"There\u2019s a considerable difference between commercial centers and the world of finance,\" a capital market player says. \"People think that if they are good managers, they can manage anything, but that isn\u2019t necessarily so. To succeed in the capital market you have to be able to bring in the best investment managers and create DNA in the organization. There are many elements that are not similar to real estate or retailing, and the mere fact that a person has financial insight doesn\u2019t mean success on the capital market. It looks sexy and glittering from the outside, but you have to understand how this sector works.\"\nPsagot\u2019s business has been growing, but it is not managing to translate this into profits. Its mutual funds took in NIS 1.4 billion in October, and NIS 7 billion in the year to the end of October, which means that it has NIS 43 billion under management. Most of the incoming money, however, went into money market funds, a product with negligible management fees and low profits.\nPsagot posted a loss of NIS 27 million for the first half of 2023, which is largely attributed to its non-bank credit business, an activity begun before Zim acquired the company. About six weeks ago, Psagot sold control of its main holding in this area, AppliCheck, to its founder, Meny Guy, and now holds 20% of that company.\nSo what will happen now? When he put Psagot up for sale a few months ago, Zim was looking for a valuation of around NIS 400 million, similar to the valuation at which he acquired it. But in the light of the current share price, and since market conditions in Israel in general indicate that it will be hard to find a buyer who wants to do a deal at this time, it\u2019s not certain that a deal is in the offing. At any rate, Group Psagot recently announced that Rani Zim was stepping down as chairperson, to be replaced by Daniel Leventhal.\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on November 5, 2023.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023.\n\nThis article, authored by Roi Weinberger, was published by Globes English | Israel Business Arena on 2023-11-05 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":73}

Wesfarmers (down 0.2 per cent), Lottery Corporation (down 3.6 per cent) and IDP Education (down 1.3 per cent) also fell. Gold miners Evolution (down 3.4 per cent) and Northern Star (down 2.6 per cent), along with NEXTDC (down 2.9 per cent) and REA Group (down 2.7 per cent) were among the biggest large-cap decliners. Healthcare player Resmed (down 2.8 per cent) and lithium miner Liontown Resources (down 2.8 per cent) both bucked the trend among their respective sectors. The lowdown\nHotter-than-expected inflation data and the prospect of more rate rises in the world\u2019s biggest economy weighed on sentiment in the Australian sharemarket as interest-rate sensitive sectors such as IT and consumer discretionary dragged the index lower on Friday. While commodity prices boosted iron ore players, company specific news was behind some of the biggest swings. Resmed extended its losses after brokers at RBC downgraded the stock and gold miner Newcrest stepped up after investors approved its merger with US gold mining giant Newmont. US stocks slipped on Thursday as the clamps tighten on Wall Street from rising yields in the bond market. The S&P 500 was 0.7 per cent lower in afternoon trading and on track to break a four-day winning streak, its longest since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 204 points, or 0.6 per cent, as of 3pm Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.8 per cent lower.\nThe stock market has largely been taking its cue from the bond market recently, and weak results announced in the afternoon for an auction of 30-year Treasury bonds sent yields of all kinds higher. Higher yields can knock down prices for stocks and slow the economy by making borrowing more expensive. Yields had already been on the rise in the morning after a report that showed inflation at the consumer level was a touch higher last month than economists expected. That raises worries about the Federal Reserve keeping its main interest rate high for a long time, as it tries to undercut inflation by knocking down investment prices and slowing the economy. Nothing in Thursday\u2019s inflation report should sway the Fed one way or the other when it comes to what it will do on November 1. The inflation report, though, also had some encouraging nuggets for financial markets underneath the surface. After ignoring prices for food and fuel, which Fed officials see as a better predictor of where inflation is heading, prices that consumers had to pay last month were in line with expectations. They also continued to decelerate from earlier months. A second economic report from the morning likewise offered both encouragement and caution for financial markets. It said slightly fewer US workers than expected applied for unemployment benefits last week. On one hand, it indicates a job market with few lay-offs, which means strength for the overall economy. But it could also be adding fuel to keep upward pressure on inflation.\nAfter the reports, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.7 per cent from 4.56 per cent late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, climbed to 5.06 per cent from 4.99 per cent. Yields are still down slightly for the week so far. After jumping last week to their highest levels in more than a decade, yields regressed following speeches that investors saw as hints that the Fed may not raise its main overnight interest rate further. Loading The big jump for the 10-year Treasury yield since the summer has pulled mortgage rates to their highest levels since the turn of the millennium, and such moves could slow the economy without requiring more Fed hikes. Nothing in Thursday\u2019s inflation report should sway the Fed one way or the other when it comes to what it will do on November 1, when it announces its next move on interest rates, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. She called the data \u201creassuringly uneventful\u201d.\n\u201cThe question around whether or not there will be one more interest rate hike is yet to be answered,\u201d she said. Rising crude oil prices have put extra pressure on inflation since the summer, and they were volatile again on Thursday. After jumping early in the day, a barrel of benchmark US crude slipped US58\u00a2 to settle at $US82.91. Brent crude, the international standard, rose US18\u00a2 to $US86 a barrel. After jumping since the summer and then regressing a couple of weeks ago, crude prices have been shaky following the latest fighting in Gaza. The worry is the violence could lead to disruptions in the supply of petroleum. Crude prices have been shaky following the latest fighting in Gaza. Credit: Bloomberg Higher oil prices add costs across the economy, and airlines are particularly affected because fuel is one of their biggest expenses.\nDelta Air Lines fell 2.3 per cent despite reporting stronger profit for the summer than analysts expected. It also reported encouraging trends for bookings going into the holiday season. The result heads a reporting season for S&P 500 companies that could mark a return to profit growth after three straight quarters of declines. Several financial giants will report on Friday, including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, along with UnitedHealth Group. Ford Motors slumped 1.9 per cent after the United Auto Workers union escalated its walkout against Detroit automakers. In a surprise move, 8700 workers left their jobs at a Ford truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe after rising sharply in much of Asia.\nTweet of the day Quote of the day \u201cWith the continued growth of distributed work, Loom helps bridge the collaboration gaps for dispersed teams in deeply human ways,\u201d said Loom co-founder and billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes as Atlassian announced it was acquiring former tech unicorn Loom, a US-based pioneer in enterprise video chat and screen recording.

{"title":"Here\u2019s how Rainforest, a budding Stripe rival, aims to win over software companies","context":"## Here\u2019s how Rainforest, a budding Stripe rival, aims to win over software companies\n\nWelcome back to The Interchange, where we take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. If you want to receive The Interchange directly in your inbox every Sunday, head here to sign up! After a bit of a quiet period, things in the world of fintech picked up in a big way this past week. We wrote about some notable fundraises, how PayPal was hit with an antitrust lawsuit, how Bolt is trying to move on after an SEC probe, and much more.\nRainforest takes on the bigger players\nIt\u2019s not every day that we\u2019re pitched companies that feel like they are taking on bigger players in a really meaningful way. This past week, I wrote about Rainforest, an Atlanta-based startup that is taking on incumbents such as Fiserv and FIS, as well as trying to take market share from other fintechs such as Stripe with its offering. Rainforest works with software companies to help them embed financial services and payments into their platforms. In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO and co-founder Joshua Silver respectfully disagreed with a16z general partner Angela Strange about her 2019 statement that every company would become a fintech. In his view, most software companies don\u2019t actually want to be fintechs and deal with all the regulatory and compliance issues that go with that. They really just want to be able to accept payments and generate more revenue from being able to do so.\nAccel led the company\u2019s $8.5 million seed round, which included participation from Infinity Ventures, BoxGroup, The Fintech Fund, Tech Square Ventures, and Ardent Venture Partners.\nIt\u2019s always cool to see startups outside the coasts growing, and Silver\u2019s confidence that what Rainforest is building will make it a formidable player in the space feels like it has merit. Founded in 2022, the startup has seen impressive growth in a short period of time, securing client commitments representing more than $500 million in processing, with much of the volume guaranteed.\nSilver believes the company\u2019s exclusive focus on software companies only gives it an edge.\n\u201cNone of the modern processors were built specifically for software platforms. Most of them were built directly for merchants, and they\u2019ve all had to retrofit their platforms even to accommodate basic payment processing and reporting functions for software companies,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\nAs such, the startup is capturing volume as software platforms migrate from legacy processors such as Fiserv and FIS. As that happens, it competes against companies like Stripe (and its Connect product) to embed financial services and payments.\nNik Milanovi\u0107 of The Fintech Fund posted on X that he believes that one of the biggest stories of the next decade will be about Stripe, \u201cwhich looks invincible from the outside, losing market share to nimble competitors.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI think Rainforest is going to be a big part of that story.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Infinity Ventures\u2019 Jeremy Jonker and former PayPal exec said he\u2019s been in payments for 13 years and has \u201cnever before seen anything like Rainforest.\u201d He told me via email that \u201cJoshua\u2019s background as a software platform founder and then as a payments consultant is a big part of the secret sauce. He\u2019s lived the pain of payments himself, and you can\u2019t underestimate the power of being in your clients\u2019 shoes. He knew that taking on risk and compliance burdens, and offering features like data portability, would be hugely attractive to platforms. We also like that it\u2019s not just him who has a wealth of payments experience \u2014 it\u2019s the entire team he\u2019s recruited to the company. Many are longtime payments and SaaS vets who knew there was so much potential for a better provider, and now they\u2019ve built it themselves.\u201d\nListen to TC+ editor Alex Wilhelm and I talk more about how there\u2019s plenty of market share to go around in Friday\u2019s episode of the Equity podcast below. \u2014 Mary Ann\nPayPal is being sued for alleged \u201cDraconian\u201d payment policies\nOn October 5, Mary Ann broke the news that PayPal has been hit with a class action lawsuit by consumers represented by law firm Hagens Berman alleging that the fintech giant\u2019s anti-steering rules stifle competition against lower-cost payment platforms such as Stripe and Shopify. Specifically, according to an investigation conducted by the firm\u2019s consumer rights attorneys, PayPal has subjected consumers to excess charges when purchasing from online merchants that accept PayPal or Venmo.\nSomeone commented on social media that they didn\u2019t see the problem with what PayPal is doing and questioned whether or not Visa and Mastercard do the same thing. So I went back to the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, who noted that the \u201canti-steering rules\u201d are not the first of their kind. They said: \u201cVisa and MasterCard once imposed similar anti-steering rules on merchants accepting their cards but, after the Justice Department sued the networks for antitrust violations, they agreed in 2010 to eliminate their anti-steering rules as part of the settlement. With payments transitioning into the digital realm, PayPal has simply ripped a page right from the Visa and MasterCard [sic] playbook.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Patrick McGahan, a partner at Scott+Scott who focuses on antitrust litigation, had an interesting take that actually involves both of those card giants. He told TechCrunch that the case illustrates that \u201cthe tensions between merchants and the payment system providers are not over, and that litigation regarding this key cost faced by merchants is likely to continue for some time.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cPlatform companies that operate as gatekeepers in their market, such as PayPal, will continue to be the subject of antitrust litigation as a result of the significant fees they charge. PayPal\u2019s fees are, however, driven by the costs imposed upon them by the dominant card schemes, Visa, Mastercard and American Express. So, we can expect PayPal will respond to this suit by arguing that it is as much of a price taker as the merchants themselves, and that the terms imposed upon it by the card schemes drive some of its anti-steering rules.\u201d\nPayPal did not respond to requests for comment. \u2014 Mary Ann\nBolt CEO gets frank about SEC probe\nBolt Financial CEO Maju Kuruvilla told me in an interview that the one-click checkout company is putting a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe behind it and is moving on.\n\u201cIt obviously is a very, very involved process, but we\u2019re really happy to put that behind us,\u201d Kuruvilla told TechCrunch. \u201cWe look forward to focusing on the momentum for the business and how we can help the retailers, especially the big retailers who are looking to us to innovate for them, because this is a tough year for retailers.\u201d\nYou might remember that Bolt, which provides checkout technology to merchants, and its co-founder Ryan Breslow, were subpoenaed last year by the SEC to investigate whether the company violated any securities laws during fundraising in 2021 when Bolt was seeking its $355 million Series E round that valued the company at $11 billion.\nThe investigation took about 15 months, but news of that probe didn\u2019t go public until July of 2023. Shortly thereafter on August 23, the SEC said, in a letter viewed by TechCrunch, it was not recommending an enforcement action for the company.\nKuruvilla spoke with me about how, exactly, the company can put something like this behind it, what it told customers and what\u2019s next.

{"title":"How the conspiracy-fueled Epoch Times went mainstream and made millions","context":"## How the conspiracy-fueled Epoch Times went mainstream and made millions\n\nIn the runup to the 2020 election, a small news organization saw an opportunity.\nThe Epoch Times directed millions of dollars in advertising toward supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and published dozens of articles parroting his lies about the election \u2014 resulting in huge growth to its audience and its coffers.\nThe strategy garnered criticism from fact-checking groups and got it banned from advertising on Facebook, but it ultimately paid off \u2014 putting the once-fringe newspaper on a path that perhaps only its leader, who claims to have supernatural powers, could have foreseen.\nToday, The Epoch Times is one of the country\u2019s most successful and influential conservative news organizations. It\u2019s powered by Falun Gong, a religious group persecuted in China, which launched The Epoch Times as a free propaganda newsletter more than two decades ago to oppose the Chinese Communist Party.\nFunded through aggressive online and real-world marketing campaigns and big-money conservative donors, The Epoch Times now boasts to be the country\u2019s fourth-largest newspaper by subscriber count. (Unlike most major newspapers, The Epoch Times isn't audited by the two major independent collectors of circulation data.) The nonprofit has amassed a fortune, growing its revenue by a staggering 685% in two years, to $122 million in 2021, according to the group\u2019s most recent tax records.\nIts editorial vision \u2014 fueled by a right-wing slant and conspiracy theories \u2014 is on display in recent reports on how \u201cJan. 6 Capitol Hill Security Footage Challenges Key Narratives\u201d and \u201cMeteorologists, Scientists Explain Why There Is \u2018No Climate Emergency.\u2019\u201d Its video series include a documentary-style film alleging widespread vaccine injury and death and an expos\u00e9 of an alleged world government agenda to harm farmers, cull the population and force survivors to eat bugs.\nWhat The Epoch Times lacks in standards, it makes up for in style and form, mirroring the aesthetics of journalism \u2014 a feature that\u2019s attracted subscribers and big-name supporters.\nAnti-vaccine activist and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calls The Epoch Times a daily read, among his most trusted news sources. \u201cThey have a real bias against China, but on other reporting, they\u2019re very courageous and it\u2019s real journalism,\u201d Kennedy said in an interview with NBC News this summer.\nIn July, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., recited the history of The Epoch Times into the congressional record. \u201cThis is all about one word: freedom,\u201d Norman said.\nThe Epoch Times has yet to throw its weight behind a candidate for 2024, but heading into the election cycle, it is moving into new and bigger office spaces and production studios in California, hiring mainstream news veterans who are not affiliated with Falun Gong, and revving up an ad-buying blitz.\n\u201cThey achieved the goal,\u201d said Brendan Steinhauser, a Texas-based Republican strategist hired by The Epoch Times in 2018 to open doors to conservative politicians and players. Steinhauser said that a series of interviews and introductions with politicians and media figures at that year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference offered access to a wider conservative audience. The Epoch Times was a \u201csupporting sponsor\u201d for this year\u2019s conference.\n\u201cThey take advantage of every opportunity,\u201d Steinhauser, who is not currently working for The Epoch Times, continued. \u201cThey studied digital marketing. They learned how to work the system. And they did it. They're smarter than people give them credit for, and they\u2019ve got the money to back it up.\u201d\nAs a nonprofit, The Epoch Times is exempt from most federal taxes. Its mission, according to tax filings, is independent journalism, \u201coutside of political interests and the pursuit of profit, for the public benefit and to be truly responsible to society.\u201d\nNeither the chairman nor the editor-in-chief of The Epoch Times returned multiple requests for comment. Representatives for The Epoch Times have previously defended it against critical reporting, labeling reports of the paper\u2019s conservative mission, and its penchant for misinformation, \u201csmears.\u201d\nEpoch Times representatives also deny an affiliation with Falun Gong, despite the two groups\u2019 clear financial and organizational ties: The Epoch Times board members and most staff are Falun Gong practitioners. The nonprofits behind The Epoch Times and Friends of Falun Gong, the movement\u2019s advocacy organization, share executives and provide grants and services to each other, according to tax filings. And the newspaper, along with a digital production company and the heavily advertised dance troupe Shen Yun, make up a nonprofit network that the leader of the religious movement calls \u201cour media.\u201d\nLi Hongzhi during an interview in New York in 1999. Henny Ray Abrams \/ AFP via Getty Images\nIn 2009, Li Hongzhi came to speak to his followers, volunteers who worked at The Epoch Times\u2019 offices in Manhattan. Li\u2019s instructions for the group were simple. They needed to reach people outside of the Falun Gong religious community. And they needed to make money. A lot of it.\n\u201cEnsure that the paper gains a foothold in ordinary society and turns profitable,\u201d Li said.\nFalun Gong \u2014 or Falun Dafa, as some followers call it \u2014 is a kind of personal development movement started by Li in China in 1992. It combines tenets of Buddhism and Taoism, and followers practice with meditation and flowing breath and movement exercises, and by studying Li\u2019s teachings.\nTo his followers, Li is a God-like figure who can levitate, walk through walls and see into the future. His ultra-conservative and controversial teachings include a rejection of modern science, art and medicine, and a denunciation of homosexuality, feminism and general worldliness.\nIn 1999, after thousands of Li\u2019s followers silently protested its repression in Beijing, China banned it altogether. Labeling it a cult, the Chinese government confiscated Falun Gong books, blocked websites, closed teaching centers and arrested practitioners. Human rights groups reported a brutal crackdown: Some adherents were sent to labor camps; others were tortured and killed.\nFalun Gong followers meditate outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington in 1999. Joyce Naltchayan \/ AFP via Getty Images file\nInternational human rights organizations condemned China\u2019s attempted eradication. In the U.S., where Li and some of his practitioners had fled, a new collection of followers organized a campaign to raise awareness and sympathy with parades, demonstrations and pamphlets that touted the benefits of Falun Gong and the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party.\nThe Epoch Times was born out of that leafleting campaign. Started in Georgia in 2000 by John Tang, a Falun Gong practitioner who remains its CEO, in essence it was a Chinese-language public relations newsletter. The group\u2019s long-term goals were ambitious: to expose the Chinese Communist Party and to save the world in a supernatural war against communism.\nThrough the early aughts, The Epoch Times grew from an online effort to a weekly physical newspaper, with a home base in New York and a TV production company, New Tang Dynasty Television. It raised money from followers and was staffed by unpaid volunteers. It ran aggregated articles on international issues from Voice of America next to Thanksgiving Day explainers, dispatches from Falun Gong parades, and expos\u00e9s on atrocities alleged to have been committed by the Chinese Communist Party.\nBy 2019, it had gone mostly digital and was spending millions of dollars on creating a network of Facebook pages and groups and running aggressive pro-Trump ad campaigns. The move toward explicit support of Republicans, despite Li\u2019s teachings to stay away from U.S. politics, was foreshadowed by Li\u2019s comments at a Falun Gong conference a year before.\nLi said that Falun Gong\u2019s media ought to put a \u201cconstructive\u201d spin on the news, to advance the group\u2019s aims. It wasn\u2019t wrong, he said, to favorably cover a politician who shared Falun Gong\u2019s conservative values and whose goals aligned with their own.\n\u201cIf someone comes along now who can help to halt the downward spiral that the world is in, then he is truly someone extraordinary!\u201d Li said. \u201cHe would in effect be helping us! Wouldn\u2019t he be helping us to save people?\u201d\nThe Epoch Times also employed a tactic more often associated with fake news content farms and scammers than news organizations, creating a network of inspiring and cute-content pages and fake accounts to inflate The Epoch Times' reach.\nIn 2019, following reporting by NBC News, Facebook found that The Epoch Times had \u201cleveraged foreign actors posing as Americans to push political content\u201d and banned it from future advertising, citing a violation of policies, including trying to circumvent review systems.\nUndeterred, The Epoch Times pivoted to video, specifically YouTube, spending millions on internet-infamous ads featuring Roman Balmakov, a former Epoch Times delivery person who now hosts the online show Facts Matter. In the ads, Balmakov rails against the mainstream media, communism and the persecution of Trump.\nThe Epoch Times also revisited a tried-and-true strategy that the original anti-communism newspaper had been built on \u2014 free physical copies. Instead of boxes on street corners, this time The Epoch Times printed and distributed unsolicited special editions of the paper from California to the Carolinas to the U.K. In Philadelphia alone in 2020, the company mailed 280,000 free copies of its newspaper, \u201cto increase subscription,\u201d according to tax documents.\nThe aggressive online and real-life marketing campaigns paid off. The group reported $76 million in subscription revenue in 2021, compared to nearly $7 million in 2019. A former employee of a regional Epoch Times operation who asked not to be identified because he feared retribution said that in order to send the papers to the most likely customers, they bought lists of addresses from data brokers, specifically for conservatives aged 60 and over. And many of the new subscribers are seniors, according to an employee\u2019s account shared at a Falun Gong conference.\nBut hundreds of online complaints suggest that not all of the new customers are satisfied.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the terrible misfortune of being subscribed to the Epoch Times without my consent,\u201d one reads. Another says: \u201cI want to stop receiving Epoch Times emails. That is all I want.\u201d\nThe Epoch Times print newspaper in Augusta, Ga., in 2020. Elijah Nouvelage \/ Bloomberg via Getty Images file\nAs The Epoch Times\u2019 marketing strategy shifted, so did the content \u2014 and by 2020, it became a megaphone for the U.S.\u2019s most extreme right-wing stories.\nThere was plenty to write about: An election marred by disinformation, the bubbling culture wars and, most helpful for a media company missioned with ending the Chinese Communist Party, a pandemic originating from China provided endless opportunities for takes that aligned with hawkish conservatives and conspiracy theorists.\nThe Epoch Times was early to lay blame on China for Covid \u2014 labeling it the \u201cCCP Virus\u201d in its coverage. (The origin of the outbreak is unknown; the best evidence still points to natural transmission from an animal market.) China\u2019s documented handling of the virus, including withholding information from researchers, a crackdown on whistleblowers and an authoritarian public health response, added credibility to The Epoch Times\u2019 unproven claims.\n\u201cThe dynamic for The Epoch Times changed in 2020, partly because of their criticism of China around Covid,\u201d said A.J. Bauer, an assistant journalism professor at the University of Alabama who studies conservative media. \u201cAn entire new kind of ecosystem of Covid deniers and skeptics overlapped with right-wing media and were citing and drawing heavily upon The Epoch Times.\u201d\nThe Epoch Times\u2019 subscription page began hosting glowing testimonials from Steve Bannon, Glenn Beck and the far-right Arizona congressman Paul Gosar. The organization became a reliable source for misinformation around Covid, its treatments and the vaccines.\nThe Epoch Times was also an early and aggressive promoter of election misinformation, according to the Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of researchers that documented misinformation and the 2020 vote. The group cited the news organization as a \u201crepeat spreader\u201d of false and misleading voter fraud stories as well as a major promoter of debunked conspiracy theories around Dominion voting machines and the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement, aimed at overturning the election results. Months after the election, The Epoch Times refused to acknowledge the results.\nWith the new bedfellows came a new revenue stream. Though Falun Gong practitioners had been a reliable source of small donations in previous years, in 2020 the group started to receive gifts and grants from big money conservative donors.\nWhile The Epoch Times is not required to list its donors, it reported $8.4 million in revenue from contributions and grants in 2020 and 2021. Tax documents from that period filed by scores of donors, accessed through ProPublica\u2019s nonprofit explorer, show some of those funds came from conservative donors and foundations.\nIn 2021, The Epoch Times received $55,750 from the National Christian Charitable Foundation, which connects anonymous donors with Christian causes, and $31,000 from Donors Trust, a fund for conservative and libertarian donors. Smaller donations came from individuals \u2014 real estate agents, investors and surgeons among them \u2014 and small family foundations, most of which support right-wing causes, including evangelical Christian groups, anti-vaccine groups and far-right media organizations.\nMost of the donors contacted by NBC News did not respond to interview requests; two declined.\nThe Epoch Times is pouring its revenue back into its own organization and others connected to the Falun Gong religious movement.\nIn the first half of this year, The Epoch Times spent 65% more on ads than in the first six months of 2022, with about half of its budget going to the X platform, formerly Twitter, according to the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Other recent ad buys were made on the right-wing sites Drudge Report, Breitbart and Rumble.\nThe Epoch Times paid a company called Data Managing Corporation $2.7 million for advertising services in 2021, according to tax documents. The company\u2019s listed address is a single-family home in New Jersey owned by a reporter for The Epoch Times, who did not return requests for comment.\nIn addition to running its business, The Epoch Times provided about $30 million in grants to its own affiliates and connected organizations in 2021, including $10.4 million to the dance troupe Shen Yun, and $8.3 million to New Tang Dynasty, which produces videos.\nThe three groups, united under the Falun Gong religious movement, made up a nearly quarter-billion dollar industry in 2021, according to tax documents. Li holds that the Falun Gong messages, shared in articles, videos and dance performances, will result in the salvation of humankind as the end of the world nears.\n\nThis article was published by Hacker News on 2023-10-16 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":76}
{"title":"Super Mario Bros. Wonder review: The joy of pure imagination","context":"## Super Mario Bros. Wonder review: The joy of pure imagination\n\nMario has been stomping Goombas, smashing blocks and running from left to right for damn near 40 years. How is Nintendo supposed to keep its classic side scroller feeling fresh after all this time? First, you shift the location to a brand new kingdom. Next, you introduce a bunch of new enemies and power-ups. But what really pushes things over the top is the introduction of a new mechanic that turns everything you think you know about Mario games on its head. What you get is Super Mario Bros. Wonder, a game that dazzles and delights while living up to its name in a variety of ways.\nWarning: This review includes some light spoilers, including the number of worlds and descriptions of some hidden levels.\nThe game starts simply enough with Mario and crew (Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Nabbit and, for the first time, Daisy) visiting Prince Florian of the Flower Kingdom. But then Bowser barges in and steals a Wonder Flower, which somehow allows him to merge with Prince Florian\u2019s castle to create a floating mecha fortress of doom. From there, your job is to collect Wonder Seeds (this game\u2019s version of stars and shines) as you help the Florians restore order to their troubled land.\nScreenshot by Sam Rutherford\/Engadget\nRight away, this has some subtle but important implications for the rest of the game. The first is that you immediately Wonder Flowers have wild and unpredictable effects. The second is that, because you\u2019re not simply recusing a princess trapped in a castle, the whole Flower Kingdom is working with you to take down Bowser. Sometimes that means you might be rescuing some trapped miners. But other times the Florians are the ones helping Mario (who also has a new voice actor for the first time) by rebuilding a bridge or donating a Wonder Seed at the beginning of a new world. The friendly little flowers scattered across each level will even shout words of encouragement or funny quips as you run by. But the impressive part is that, even in a relatively straightforward platformer like this, there\u2019s a sense of community that makes this world feel more lived in than a lot of epic RPGs.\nYou\u2019ll find a number of familiar baddies along with some new foes across an incredible range of environments and levels. Wonder features six main worlds each with a distinctive theme. But within those, you\u2019ll still run into reimagined haunted houses, pirate ships, underwater stages and more. One twist for this game is the addition of badges, which are earned by completing specific levels and some may even be required to find secrets or reveal alternate exits. Some allow you to jump farther or float, while others make extra coins appear. There are even protective badges, like the one that automatically saves you if you fall into lava or poison. It\u2019s a mechanic that feels inspired by recent roguelikes, such as Hades, and it does a great job of adding customizability and replayability.\nHave you ever thought about what it would be like to hear Piranha Plants serenade you? Screenshot by Sam Rutherford\/Engadget\nHowever, the biggest twist in the game is the Wonder Flowers themselves. In addition to the one Bowser stole, there\u2019s also one hidden in almost every stage. And if you find it, you better be prepared for the unexpected. Touching them transports you to an alternate dimension where the rules of the Marioverse have been completely rewritten. In one level Super Stars rain down from the sky, while in another you might be transformed into a giant slime. You may also run into Wonder Flowers which converts the game from a side scroller into a top-down 2D maze or suddenly find yourself the target in a shooting gallery.\nAlmost every flower is different and the possibilities are seemingly endless. In a recent volume of Nintendo\u2019s Ask the Developer, I learned that the team had a wall of sticky notes with over 2,000 ideas, and after playing Wonder, I believe it. Wonder Flowers feel like they add an extra half a level to every stage; they\u2019re a delicious dessert on top of an already bountiful meal.\nToad ain't scared of some stormy skies. Screenshot by Sam Rutherford\/Engadget\nEven without the aid of a Wonder Flower, the sheer variety of level types is impressive. Alongside classic stages that are capped off by grabbing a flag, there are also races, badge challenges, puzzle levels and more. There are KO Arenas that let you pick your power-up of choice (Fire Flower, Elephant Suit, Bubble Mushroom or the Drill Hat) before taking down waves of enemies, while Break Time levels provide quick 30-second bursts of excitement. You\u2019ll never be bored, even if you want a change from standard platform jumping.\nI also have to say that this might be the best Mario and friends have ever looked, and that includes recent 3D titles like Odyssey. There is just so much detail packed into every level and character. From the determined face Mario makes when he runs around, to the little flames that sprout from your feet every time you jump.\nWonder\u2019s map is also surprisingly engaging. In the beginning, I wasn\u2019t sure if the ability to freely roam around added all that much. But as I progressed, I found a number of secret nooks and crannies that wouldn\u2019t have fit if the game was locked to a handful of paths. And with Wonder Flowers giving Nintendo the freedom to mix and match mechanics and enemies, there\u2019s just so much to see.\nDon't let Wiggler beat you. Screenshot by Sam Rutherford\/Engadget\nNintendo even managed to address a gripe I had about the pacing of previous 2D Marios. Since they\u2019re meant for both experienced gamers and children who might be new to the franchise, they often locked more challenging levels behind the story\u2019s completion. This meant the beginning of the game could be a slog as you rushed through easier levels to get to the more challenging bits. But with the addition of difficulty ratings and hidden paths that lead to 5-star levels long before you finish the game, there isn\u2019t the same rush to get to the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d And I should say that 4- and particularly 5-star levels are balanced just right. Completing one feels like a rewarding challenge, without crossing over into punishing.\nI do have some very minor complaints about things like mummy enemies (pulling their wraps feels a bit tedious) and I fear the Elephant Suit might be a bit overpowered in comparison to the Drill Hat. The 5-star levels and rhythm stages are also so good I wish there were more of them, I just can\u2019t get enough. And I\u2019m slightly disappointed the adorable penguins from the movie didn\u2019t make an appearance somewhere in Wonder\u2019s ice levels.\nHave you ever seen a Boo this big? Screenshot by Sam Rutherford\/Engadget\nBut on the whole, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a marvelous game. Its art and animations have a level of polish that\u2019s practically unmatched by rival titles, and the addition of Wonder Seeds subverts your expectations and keeps this 40-year franchise feeling new and innovative. In a lot of ways, Wonder reminds me of my favorite 2D Mario game: Super Mario World. While I wish it didn\u2019t take more than 10 years for Nintendo to create a proper sequel to its last mainline platformer, if that\u2019s what it takes to get a game like this, I\u2019m happy to sit and wonder what\u2019s next for Mario.\n\nThis article, authored by Sam Rutherford, was published by Engadget on 2023-10-20 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":77}
{"title":"Israel's defense undone by reliance on technology","context":"## Israel's defense undone by reliance on technology\n\nThe Berlin Wall was built in 1961 as a standard wire and concrete fence to make it difficult for East German residents to escape to freedom in the West. By the end of the 1970s, its fourth generation already included a 127 km long electrified fence, a strip of land made of sharp metal nails, a closely-packed row of watchtowers, a patrol road, an intrusion-tracking dirt road, guard dogs, deep trenches anti-vehicle trenches, and two layers of concrete walls. \"The fence was initially quite weak, so it was decided to place guards every few meters on top of the wall,\" Dr. Avner Barnea, a former Shin Bet senior officer and lecturer on intelligence and national security, and business intelligence at Bar-Ilan University, tells \"Globes.\" \"But until they mined the area, they didn't really succeed in preventing escapees. These low-tech solutions made all the difference. None of the authorities ever took the risk of relying on advanced technologies.\"\nThe fence that, until October 7, separated Israel and the Gaza Strip was completed in December 2021, 60 years after construction of the Berlin Wall began. It was intended to protect against a major security threat, but in practice it was much leaner than that. The fence was almost unmanned by soldiers, and relied mainly on sensors, above and below ground, surveillance cameras, and vehicle patrols. And, of course, there was no surrounding minefield.\nAfter Operation Protective Edge in 2014 revealed that Hamas forces were able to penetrate the Gaza border settlements at several points via underground tunnels, it was decided in 2016 to build a defense line focused on this threat called \"the anti-tunnel barrier\" that would replace the existing fence. The upper section of the barrier was based mainly on a fence called the \"sand clock,\" which had only proved itself in stopping illegal immigrants on the Israel-Egypt border - the same fence that then-US President Donald Trump enthused over, and wanted to duplicate on the US southern border.\nThe cost of the barriers was NIS 3.5 billion, mostly for the below-ground section. It was presented as a high-tech project and as a great technological achievement that would be an additional layer of protection from the Gazan threat, along with the Iron Dome. The Ministry of Defense (MOD) boasted that \"the amount of concrete invested in it could pave a road from Israel to Bulgaria, and the amount of iron and steel could equal an iron bar from here to Australia\". At that time, the Ministry of Defense claimed it would be integrated into the \"Smart and Lethal Border\" project that was being tested along the northern border of the Gaza Strip which, the Ministry of Defense stated, included mobile robots and military drones for carrying out defense missions, without endangering soldiers' lives.\nAt the time of the completion of the fence, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then in the opposition, referred mainly to the below-ground aspect, saying that \"Any time Hamas terrorists have tried to penetrate the border settlements through the tunnels, they were terminated underground. The below-ground barrier surrounding the Gaza Strip has already saved many lives.\" Then-Minister of Defense Benny Gantz said, \"The barrier, which is a superior initial technological and inventive project that sets an iron wall, sensors and concrete between it and the residents of the south. It provides a sense of personal security that will allow this beautiful region to continue to grow.\"\n\"The concept underlying the construction of an advanced technology fence relates to the Second Lebanon War, when Hezbollah surmounted a high fence with a ladder,\" says Yehoshua Kalisky , senior researcher at Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). \"This was the reference scenario. There was no thought that they would use aircraft here to cross it or that they would come with a heavy machinery, and simply breach it.\"\nThe illusion of superiority\nOn the morning of Saturday, October 7, the above-ground section of the barrier turned out to be completely insubstantial, as was its fundamental concept of defense. Using drones easily purchased on the Internet, Hamas disabled both the cameras transmitting images to control room monitors in real time, and the (See and Fire) long distance stationary remote controlled weapon stations (RCWS). There had been a second line of defense, observation balloons, but for unknown reasons, all three had stopped working some weeks before the attack, and repairs were postponed until \"after the holidays.\"\nIsrael\u2019s drone warfare fleet, which is capable of jamming signals of a hostile drone, and the attack drone fleet, known for warfare against incendiary balloons, also did not work for unknown reasons, and dozens of Hamas drones operated without interruption. The IDF's Iron Beam high energy laser (HEL) interception system, which was developed for such cases, among other things, has not yet entered into operational activity after many years of development. All allowed the Hamas terrorists to quickly reach the IDF bases along the Gaza border, disable the information and communications technology (ICT) systems, neutralizing the ability to call reinforcements without arousing much suspicion at IDF Kirya headquarters in Tel Aviv.\nAbove all there was a sense of security and belief in technology and the sophisticated barrier\u2019s ability to prevent any form of intrusion. With the fence as protection, manned deployment for Gaza border settlements was cancelled, (in any case, these had been reduced immediately after Operation Protective Edge), units deployed in the area were reduced, replaced with cameras and other electronic means.\n\"When relying on technology, the expectation is that it will warn of the dangers and threats,\" Barnea says. \"When the thinking is that you don't need soldiers because there are monitors, you expect in advance that you will receive the warning about the threat via the technological means and no one imagines a situation in which the observation array would be neutralized. On the contrary, it is seen as invulnerable. The problem begins when the enemy is also exposed to these means: RCWS are great, they are important and cost millions, but they are visible to everyone, and everyone knows where they are. Once you begin believing that the fence will stop all the relevant threats, you think even half a battalion on standby is enough. Technology greatly influences our way of thinking and is seen as the answer to everything - only no one ever asks themselves what the vulnerabilities are, and what is the backup plan for the doomsday scenario when the technology layer collapses.\"\nBarnea compares Israel\u2019s sense of technological superiority with US activity during the Vietnam War between 1965 and 1968. \"The Americans relied on massive aerial bombardment with precision bombs and napalm bombs that burned huge areas, and advocated the \"scorched earth\" concept. They convinced themselves that the Vietcong could not withstand it. In practice, the North Vietnamese army studied the American activity. It dug tunnels, moved equipment and people between bombings, eventually enabling it to reach the important bases in the south of the country, and overwhelm the Americans. In fact, the US military so believed in the damage it was causing that they reported a far greater number of casualties on the other side than the actual number, which in turn created an illusion of victory. They told themselves, we have B-52 bombers, there's no way we can't win.\"\nTechnological sophistication and the massive investment in intelligence means have greatly increased the IDF's visual intelligence gathering capabilities, according to former IDF Intelligence Directorate head General (ret.) Aharon Ze'evi-Farkash. \"I'm sure it doesn't come at the expense of human sources, but as time goes by, gathering visual intelligence is easier than human sources and they bring better results. It's hard to bring in a Palestinian 'Ashraf Marwan,' the agent who passed the information to Israel before the Egyptian attack in 1973. It\u2019s a problem because the human source is essential to provide an interpretation of the rest of the information that\u2019s received, and to make decisions. Golda knew who Marwan was and expected to hear what he would say about the Egyptian deployment in the south.\" At the same time, according to \"The New York Times\" a year before the attack, the IDF stopped monitoring Hamas' radio communications last year. The US had put stock in Israeli intelligence regarding Hamas in recent years and hadn\u2019t monitored it independently.\nThe human factor\nThe technological concept is, of course, not limited to the border fence, or to intelligence, and is not just a product of Operation Protective Edge. For years, the IDF has been praising the ethos of a small and smart army, implicitly if not explicitly. In recent years, it has publicized countless technological projects and present itself as a high-tech army: establishing a technological division, called Shiloh, to coordinate the development of technologies for all branches of the army, and with the Directorate of Defense Research & Development (IMOD DDR&D or MAFAT). Shiloh, which is currently subordinate to the Ministry of Defense, was established following State Comptroller reports about the lack of coordination and synchronization between the Ministry of Defense and the IDF units; and lead a new border defense concept based on sensors and other technologies for gathering intelligence and thwarting infiltration; strengthening the Air Force in the form of additional aircraft and armaments; and strengthening the operational end of the regular front units.\nAll this, while at the same time closing down armored battalions and consolidating helicopter squadrons. Ground force technological capabilities were also addressed, such as improved coordination between the infantry and air forces in air-to-ground actions, or identifying terrorists and weapons in an urban environment. However, there is a problem at the outset, says, Prof. Eviatar Matania of Tel Aviv University School of Political Sciences, Government and International Affairs, and founder and first director general of the Israel National Cyber Directorate: a large gap between the technology and the officers expected to implement it as part of the security concept.\nMatania explains that the IDF has always advocated technological advancement as part of a concept that values quality over quantity. \"This existed even during [Israel\u2019s first Prime Minster David] Ben-Gurion\u2019s time, because it was clear that we could not defeat the enemy in terms of quantity, and it also integrated well with saving human lives - an important pillar in the security concept - but at that time, innovation was expressed in tactical issues. After the Yom Kippur War, Israel pulled strongly in the direction of building military technological superiority, and this integrated well with the Israeli economy, which was gradually opening up to the world, and the computer revolution.\nThis effort bore fruit as early as 1982, when we proved to the whole world that we could destroy most of the Syrian surface-to-air missile array using precision-guided weaponry. Israel's security concept was updated by Dan Meridor and Lt. Col. Ron Eldadi, with the addition of a fourth component, defense, to the three components of Israel\u2019s traditional national security doctrine as determined by Ben-Gurion: deterrence, warning, and decisive victory, leading to the development of systems such as the Iron Dome, and David's Sling (formerly called Magic Wand).\"\nBut, emphasizes Matania, \"The IDF senior officers aren\u2019t technologically savvy as a whole, some see these systems as black boxes, and don't always understand their advantages and disadvantages. At the West Point or Annapolis military academies, it's customary to teach technological subjects as well, because they understand that the military profession today requires a basic understanding of the field. The correct way to integrate technology with security is to implement it as part of an operational concept, not as a single component, and to assume that it is not perfect, but has vulnerabilities, and may suffer from system failures. Therefore, such systems always need what\u2019s known as 'redundancy', i.e. backup systems, to make sure there isn\u2019t a single point of vulnerability through which everything could collapse. The Air Force, for example, has several different models of aircraft just for this. Every plane also has several systems to back it up.\"\nThe Iron Dome paradox\nPerhaps more than anything else, the Iron Dome system is representative as the technological response to the threat from Gaza. Matania explains, \"The Iron Dome was built with the strategic vision of giving decision-makers breathing room, to allow them not to react immediately to the rockets, but to have the flexibility to react at the right time, and in the right place, in a range of ways. But some say its success was paradoxical. Iron Dome was so successful it not only supported the decision-making process but fundamentally changed it. Up until October 7, it served as a very successful plaster to threats to a sovereign state, because what legitimacy would a state leader have for going to war when no citizens were harmed?\"\nBrigadier General Eran Ortal, until recently the commander of The Dado Center for Interdisciplinary Military Studies, a military research center subordinate to the Operations Directorate, also believes that various technological measures such as the Iron Dome, and the barrier, influenced decision-making in Israel. In his estimation, these helped the political echelon conduct a policy of military restraint towards the Gaza Strip, which in turn allowed Hamas to strengthen and gain offensive capabilities.\nIn an article five years ago, Ortal, currently in active military service an unavailable for interview, wrote, \"Israeli restraint as regards proactive thwarting of offensive capabilities in the Gaza Strip stems from a clear Israeli strategy that strives to reduce the influence of the enemy on the current routine of life in Israel, even at the price of worsening of the threat in the future.\" Ortal pointed out that this policy was natural and that \"a Western nation cannot lead its life in an endless state of emergency. But alongside the understanding of the need for a containment policy, it must be recognized that the risks are high, as evidenced by the steeply worsening intensity of conflicts between Israel and the terrorist organizations in Gaza.\"\nAccording to Ortal, in recent decades, Hamas and Hezbollah developed ballistic missiles and terror tunnels in response to Israeli policy that sought minimal friction with the enemy through separation and withdrawal from the security zone in southern Lebanon, and the Gaza Strip. Ortal points out that between Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 and Operation Protective Edge in 2014, Israel significantly reduced targeted countermeasures against terrorist operatives, and none focused on Hamas operatives. According to his analysis, this was because, prior to the Iron Dome coming into use in 2011, the most dangerous threat posed by Gaza developed in the period preceding Operation Protective Edge. The understandings that Israel reached with Hamas in 2012 were made \"to stop the fighting\", Ortal says, and to get life back to normal as quickly as possible. This, after air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem for the first time since the Yom Kippur War, and the education system shut down for more than a week.\nEven after Iron Dome, Israel found it difficult to stand up against the significant disruption of daily life on the home front. \"Despite the clear threat posed by Gaza, the decision makers preferred to avoid a policy that would mean returning a large part of the country's population to the reality of air raids and disrupted daily routines. The bottom line: the Iron Dome did not change the essential strategic situation; as firepower from the Gaza Strip developed, so did the terrorist organizations\u2019 ability to control daily life in Israel\u2019s hinterland, hold it hostage, and restrain Israel from taking proactive measures against them.\"\n\"Why didn't the relative success of the Iron Dome translate into the even more important strategic achievement of restoring Israel's freedom of action against Hamas in the Strip?\" asks Ortal rhetorically, and names several factors. \"The first, like any other operational system, Iron Dome is also not perfect. The enemy studies it and develops its own challenges against it, and the decision makers recognized the fact that the State of Israel is not hermetically protected. Second, the enormous cost involved in deploying and operating [Iron Dome] batteries significantly impedes a policy based on continuous rounds of violence. Thirdly, as long as the rockets are intercepted in the skies over Israel, and not the skies over Gaza, the Israeli home front is forced to experience sirens, security rooms and shelters, and disrupted routine living. In other words, even the complete success of the Iron Dome left daily life on the home front in the hands of the terrorist organizations.\"\nIn 2018, Ortal wrote about \"the barrier\" that, \"it would be wrong to assume it will turn out to be more immune than its predecessors. The longer as we delay cutting the direct connection between the Hamas rockets and those of our other enemies, who make extensive use of this method of operation, and the idea of attacking our territory, the longer we will be condemned to watch from the sidelines and look at their constant enhancement.\"\nA strategic surprise\nIn the months leading up to October 7, the former head of the Planning Division, Major General (Res.) Giora Eiland, held a series of lectures for senior officers on the reasons for the strategic surprise that fell on the IDF in the Yom Kippur War. \"Not one of the officers imagined that 50 years after that mistake, it would repeat itself in exactly the same way,\" he tells Globes.\nThe strategic surprise that hit the State of Israel about four weeks ago bears similar characteristics to the Japanese attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in 1941; to the Argentine surprise attack on Britain's Falkland Islands in 1982; the Al-Qaeda attack on the United States on September 11, 2001; and to the spread of ISIS throughout the Middle East in 2014.\nIn fact, Barnea claims, despite the technological progress and sophistication, intelligence officials are questioning whether there really is a trend towards improvement of early detection and thwarting of strategic threats. A comprehensive study conducted on intelligence failures in the national arena, from the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 to 2010, showed no improvement in providing or thwarting warnings about strategic surprises, even if the means of gathering information had improved. Four years after signing the study, former US President Barack Obama admitted that US intelligence had not correctly assessed the severity of the threat of large parts of Iraq and Syria being occupied by ISIS.\n\"No matter how technologically advanced your army or how effective your intelligence gathering system, identifying strategic surprises is a human process that depends on analyzing what is called, in the intelligence community, 'weak signals,'\" Barnea says. \"These are pieces of relevant information that have been conveyed to the organization, but because they are low-key, or because of the information overload around them, the organization fails to identify and interpret them correctly.\"\nOn Saturday, October 7, for example, suspicious movement in Gaza convinced the Shin Bet head to send a special team to the southern border, but he was unable to convince the top IDF echelons to prepare accordingly. To handle those weak signals, Eiland claims, one must use \"scenario theory\", meaning, taking into account scenarios that have a low probability of occurring, but with devastating results should they occur, and the simple way to prepare for them.\nEiland explains: \"You detect certain noises on Friday night, but conclude that the probability of an attack is low, let's say only 10%. Those who act only on the probability do not consider the question: if this attack happens - will you be able to live with yourself for eliminating this threat? There\u2019s also a third consideration, which is ease of effort: what is the effort required of me to prepare for this unlikely but dangerous scenario? It may be a relatively simple effort, like waking the troops up at 4:00 am, placing them position, and putting an aircraft in the air for a few hours. You don\u2019t even need pilots - unmanned aircraft operators are enough. There\u2019s no need to mobilize reserves or convene a cabinet. Every commander is allowed to give instructions to those under him - if that would have happened, everything would be different.\n\"This is exactly the same type of failure that was at the basis of Israeli thinking at the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War,\" Eiland continues. \"After information was gathered that indicated the intentions of the Egyptians and Syrians to launch an attack, they decided not to mobilize reserves because the cost was high. But why didn't they order the regular army to get ready? They thought the chance of war breaking out was low, they thought it was an exercise, but they didn't calculate the potential damage, they didn't imagine how serious the extreme scenario could be.\"\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on November 5, 2023.\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023.\n\nThis article, authored by Assaf Gilead, was published by Globes English | Israel Business Arena on 2023-11-05 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":78}
{"title":"Michigan sign-stealing scandal winners and losers, from Jim Harbaugh to Tony Petitti","context":"## Michigan sign-stealing scandal winners and losers, from Jim Harbaugh to Tony Petitti\n\nThe Big Ten announced Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh will be prohibited from coaching on the sideline for the remainder of the regular season.\nAt least, in theory. The Friday ruling is the next chapter in an NCAA investigation into Michigan for in-person scouting and sign stealing in a scandal that led to the resignation of staffer Connor Stallions on Nov. 3. Harbaugh will be allowed to coach during the week but will not be able to be on the sideline. Michigan did not get a ruling on a temporary restraining order ahead of the showdown against No. 10 Penn State.\nThe Wolverines still won 24-15 under interim coach Sherrone Moore, but the fallout from the scandal continues to have a far-reaching impact on the Big Ten, Michigan and college football beyond this year's College Football Playoff race.\nA look at the winners and losers from the scandal to date:\nMichigan scandal winners and losers\nWinners\nTony Petitti\nPetitti certainly did not hit Michigan with a \"slap on the wrist.\" That ruling showed Petitti is not afraid to take on one of the Big Two within the conference. In a letter to Michigan, Petitti tried to dispel those notions. Via The Athletic's Nicole Auerbach:\n\u201cThe Conference does not play favorites among its members, nor does it take actions towards its members based on prejudgment or bias. Failing to act under the extraordinary circumstances here could lead other Conference members to reasonably conclude that the conference has chosen to favor the University over all other members.\u201d\nTony Petitti, in letter to Michigan, says that the school initially refused to consent to the Big Ten obtaining the spreadsheet and other documents from the NCAA related to its investigation.\n\nAlso makes point to say he's not playing favorites. pic.twitter.com\/OgTvTNY1QI \u2014 Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) November 10, 2023\nMost speculation pinned a potential Harbaugh suspension at two games knowing that the regular-season finale against No. 1 Ohio State is a huge television draw and Petitti has a background in TV with the MLB Network. Petitti went heavy-handed instead, maybe a little too heavy considering the pending legal response from Michigan.\nThis no doubt is risky on several fronts. The Big Ten made it clear that they still have not linked Harbaugh to any wrongdoing and that this an institutional penalty based on the findings. The NCAA also will continue its investigation into the Wolverines. The timing of Friday's announcement also was poor \u2013 less than 24 hours before the game against Penn State. Petitti upheld sportsmanship within the conference, but it could lead to a long-term rift with Michigan.\nRegardless, Petitti did the right thing.\nDECOURCY: Michigan got off easy with Harbaugh suspension\nOhio State-Michigan TV ratings\nWith or without Harbaugh, The Game will draw ridiculous television ratings.\nAccording to Sports Media Watch, three college football games have drew a Nielsen rating of 5.0 or better this season. Penn State-Ohio State (5.3), Colorado-Oregon (5.2) and Ohio State-Notre Dame (5.1) make up that list. Michigan-Penn State should join that list on Saturday, but the intrigue around The Game this year could double all of those games.\nLast year's matchup drew an 8.05 with 17.1 million viewers. Michigan won the last two meetings and has a chance to win three in a row in the rivalry for the first time since 1995-97. Ohio State is No. 1 in the College Football Playoff rankings. Harbaugh (2-5) and Day (1-2) both have losing records in this rivalry matchup, and the Big Ten East, CFP and perhaps national championship are on the line.\nWill this game draw a 10 Nielsen rating and 20 million viewers? It's not out of the question, and there will be enough WWE-like promos leading up to this game to get both fan-bases frothing.\nHelmet technology\nCBSSports.com reported on Oct. 20 that the NCAA rules committee is giving teams the option of coach-to-player helmet communication to relay plays from the sideline during bowl season this year. Tablets will inevitably follow, and here is the sliver of good that will come from this scandal.\nIt's about damn time. Death to sandwich-board playcalling, please. Bring on those playsheets where coaches simply have to cover their mouth. This is one instance where emulating the NFL game is overdue.\nSherrone Moore\nIf Moore is going to be a head coach, then Saturday\u2019s victory against the Nittany Lions was a fitting audition. The Wolverines rushed for 227 yards \u2013 including 32 straight run plays \u2013 in grinding out a top-10 victory at one of the toughest environments in the FBS at Beaver Stadium.\nMoore was emotional - complete with NSFW language \u2013 in the aftermath.\nSherrone Moore filled in for Jim Harbaugh as Michigan's coach today.\n\nHe was emotional after defeating Penn State.\n\n\"I want to thank Coach Harbaugh. ... I love the s\u2014 out of you man.\"\n\n\ud83c\udfa5: @CFBONFOX pic.twitter.com\/NmXZWrGxCM \u2014 The Sporting News (@sportingnews) November 11, 2023\nMoore, however, will emerge as a leading candidate for some jobs as a result, and that is a huge victory for one of the nation\u2019s top assistants.\nLosers\nConnor Stalions\nStalions made a name for himself. He will be remembered as the Michigan staffer as the center of this sign-stealing scandal. Stalions resigned on Nov. 3. The NCAA investigation whether Michigan was involved with in-person scouting, which is prohibited by the NCAA, put Stalions into the college football consciousness. According to ESPN.com, Stalions allegedly purchased tickets to more than 35 games involving Big Ten and potential CFP opponents.\nPhotos also surfaced os a person who resembles Stalions on the Central Michigan sideline during the Chippewas' opener against Michigan State on Sept. 1. Central Michigan has yet to confirm who that person was, another layer to a wild Stalions story that has supplied endless meme and conspiracy material on social media.\nStalions might be the fall guy who saved Michigan from further wrath from the Big Ten and NCAA or the reason the Wolverines' national championship season unraveled. That fate is yet to be determined, but at minimum he will be one of those controversial names we'll never forget, like Harvey Updyke and Nevin Shapiro.\nJim Harbaugh\nOn one hand, Harbaugh could serve his second suspension within one season and further NCAA punishment could be coming down the line. On the other, he could emerge as a martyr for Michigan fans given there is reportedly no proof yet he knew of Stalion's rule-breaking.\nHarbaugh will have a temporary restraining order hearing on Nov. 17, according to ESPN.com. That will determine whether he returns to the field for the final two games against Maryland and No. 1 Ohio State.\nIt's an inescapable fact that Harbaugh is 31-3 \u2013 and Michigan is 35-3 \u2013 since the program bottomed out at the end of the 2020 season. While it is almost impossible to quantify how much the alleged in-person scouting and sign-stealing would have helped the Wolverines over the past two seasons, it will be a tough stain to erase knowing those violations are now on the Big Ten record.\nWhat will Harbaugh do now? That is almost impossible to predict given his combative personality. Would he sign a contract extension and continue to fight the NCAA? Will Harbaugh finally take the parachute to the NFL? Those are questions bound to come up at the end of the 2023 season.\nBENDER: Michigan will need Jim Harbaugh against Ohio State\nBig Ten\nThis is the fourth football scandal in less than a calendar year.\nThree former Iowa football players and a student manager were charged in an illegal sports wagering scandal. Several student-athletes face allegations of placing bets on games in which they played in. Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald was fired on July 10 after a hazing investigation into the program. Fitzgerald is suing the university for wrongful termination. Michigan State fired Mel Tucker on Sept. 27 after allegations of sexual misconduct from Brenda Tracy, a speaker on sexual assault awareness.\nNow, Michigan has a scandal on the field, and they countered with allegations that Ohio State and Rutgers leaked Michigan's signs to Purdue in last year's Big Ten championship game. ESPN reported that Big Ten coaches and athletic directors encouraged Big Ten commissioner Petitti to act last week, but that resulted in action before the NCAA investigation concluded.\nDo you wonder what the SEC and commissioner Greg Sankey privately think about all this? For the Big Ten, it is an ugly run of bad behavior on and off the field for a conference that is welcoming four new members next season in Oregon, UCLA, USC and Washington.\nTo be determined\nMichigan\nMichigan is 10-0 and on track to meet No. 1 Ohio State for another blockbuster matchup in college football\u2019s best rivalry. On the field, the Wolverines remain on track for a third straight Big Ten championship and shot at the College Football Playoff.\nBut this is about more than football.\nWill more penalties come from the Big Ten and NCAA as a result of the in-person scouting scandal that has not left the college football consciousness this month? Will the Harbaugh-Petitti battle lead to an unsettling end for Michigan? President Santa Ono and athletic director Warde Manuel have voiced their support for Harbaugh, but that has been more about due process than admitting to any wrongdoing.\nIt has thrust the Wolverines \u2013 a talented team led by J.J. McCarthy, Blake Corum and a defense that allows 7.5 points per game \u2013 into a villain role, complete with visits from Ric Flair. That only works when you are winning. One loss, and all this could unravel, and the Terps and Buckeyes still remain on the schedule.\nWill a national championship outweigh the stain on their reputation? The answer is almost always yes for the fans, but the program might feel a different long-term result.\n\nThis article, authored by Bill Bender, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-11 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":79}
{"title":"Browns survive Bears Hail Mary on wild, near-catch by Darnell Mooney: 'Damn near s\u2014 myself'","context":"## Browns survive Bears Hail Mary on wild, near-catch by Darnell Mooney: 'Damn near s\u2014 myself'\n\nThe Bears' prayers were nearly answered on a game-ending Hail Mary. Instead, Cleveland fans exhaled as their team came away with an improbable win against Chicago.\nJustin Fields and the Bears had the ball at the Cleveland 45 trailing by three with five seconds left on the clock. There was no time for a play and a field goal without any timeouts to try for a shorter kick.\nChicago's only hope of winning the game \u2014 and keeping its surging playoff trending up \u2014 would rest on a Hail Mary, a play so dubbed because it takes a miracle to succeed.\nThe Bears nearly had their miracle. The ball had the distance and it was tipped in the air several times and began to fall into the arms of Bears receiver Darnell Mooney, who was falling toward the endzone turf. He had his hands on it as it began to fall into his chest.\nThe ball deflected off his hands and legs and ultimately into the waiting hands of safety D'Anthony Bell, who made the catch and slid to the ground to end the game and seal the Browns' 20-17 win.\n\"It would've been crazy,\" Mooney said after the game. \"I mean, how many times you see a Hail Mary work and actually fall into, being able to make the catch? It's tough. I wish I could've had it, but I mean it is what it is.\"\nMORE: Jets' offensive line issues, playoff elimination could end Rodgers' comeback attempt\nThe balance of the game was suspended in the air as the ball deflected from Bear to Brown. Cleveland tight end David Njoku had the same reaction as likely just about any fan watching the game in the stands or at home.\n\"I damn near s\u2014 myself, dog,\" Njoku said, per The Athletic's Zac Jackson.\nThe Bears' sideline appeared convinced it had won. Fields said that as the ball began to fall into Mooney's hands, the Chicago sideline began to erupt before realizing the ball would not be ending in Bears' hands.\nFields' counterpart, Joe Flacco, could only watch on the jumbotron as the play unfolded. He had just driven the Browns to the go-ahead score the drive before. In his 16 years in the NFL, he's seen a lot, and he knew to hold off on any celebration until the game was official.\n\"When you watch and or are a part of all the games that go on every week, you know not to get excited until that clock hits zero,\" Flacco said. \"There's so many things that can happen, whether we've been a part of it or whether like I said you've seen it on Sundays just watching TV so believe me I was over there and guys want to come up and congratulate and things like that and I'm just sitting there waiting for that clock to hit zero.\"\nMORE: Updated NFL playoff picture in Week 15\nBrowns edge rusher Myles Garrett was on the field as one of the few players at the line of scrimmage, focusing more on pressuring Fields than picking him off. And when Fields got the throw off, he, too, became a spectator.\n\"Shoot, too good of a view,\" Garrett said. \"He kinda looked at me just made sure I was far enough and then tossed it up and I was like, 'Please, Lord, don't let us be on one of these YouTube compilations.'\"\nIt had been a wild ending to the game. Chicago had led 17-7 heading into the fourth quarter, but on successive drives, the Browns scored a field goal to open the fourth quarter, scored a game-tying touchdown with 3:08 left in the contest. Cleveland forced a three-and-out, then drove down the field in eight plays to kick a go-ahead field goal with 32 seconds left, burning all of Chicago's timeouts in the process.\nThe Bears got a bit of life when Tyler Scott caught a short pass from Fields and raced up the right sideline 30 yards to move up to Cleveland's 45. But after back-to-back incompletions, the Bears were forced to try for the Hail Mary rather than kick the long field goal.\n\"At the end of the game, I loved the way our guys battled at the end,\" Bears coach Matt Eberflus said. \"And what a nice play by T Scott to put us in position and, again, we were just too far back. We ended up throwing the Hail Mary at the end and we had a chance there too, that's just about focus and concentration at the very end and making a really good play.\"\nChicago had plenty of other issues that contributed to coming up short to the Browns. The Bears' only touchdowns came when an interception spotted Chicago at the Browns' 1-yard line and another on a pick-six. The offense went three-and-out eight times. And rather than try for a go-ahead, 54-yard field goal, the Bears opted for a Hail Mary from the Browns' 37 with no time left in the first half, leading to Fields' first interception. The only two Chicago turnovers came on Fields' Hail Mary tries.\nThe loss was also particularly crushing for a team that had won back-to-back games, with a pair of wild-card contenders in the Vikings and Packers losing this weekend. But dropping to 5-9 is a crushing blow to Chicago's playoff hopes and solidifies it will be another season of a sub-.500 record in the Windy City.\n\nThis article, authored by Edward Sutelan, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-17 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":80}
{"title":"The future of DC movies in 2022 and beyond","context":"## The future of DC movies in 2022 and beyond\n\nThe DC Extended Universe, as DC Comics\u2019 movie and TV line was originally called, has gone through some major growing pains since it launched with Zack Snyder\u2019s Man of Steel in 2013. Looking for ways to compete with Marvel Comics\u2019 massively popular Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC has repeatedly switched tracks and tactics on the DCEU, sometimes steering toward a single interconnected universe, then backtracking into a more director-driven plan where movies like Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker could be made without fitting into any specific previous continuity.\nIn 2023, the Snyderverse is coming to an end, slowly rolling to a halt with movies like Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, and Blue Beetle, all leading up to the grand finale of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Once the last bits of the DCEU make their way to theaters, it will be time to usher in a new era of DC movies.\nGuardians of the Galaxy and Suicide Squad director James Gunn and producer Peter Safran are taking the reins of the newly branded DC Studios, and they\u2019re bringing a long-term plan to DC with them. The new projects on the DC docket are meant to reboot or reshape DC\u2019s best-known heroes, while reaching into some deeper corners of the DC canon for more obscure characters. And it\u2019s wrapping up the DCEU era, replacing it with just \u201cthe DCU,\u201d a mainline continuity that will exist alongside other DC film and TV universes. Here\u2019s everything DC is currently planning to put in theaters and on TV screens, in 2023 and well into the future.\n[Ed. note: This story only covers Warner Bros.\u2019 DC projects and doesn\u2019t include The CW\u2019s Arrowverse, which is effectively ending in 2023.]\n2023\nAquaman and The Lost Kingdom: Dec. 20\nExpect online fandom debates to go ballistic again as we get closer to the sequel to James Wan\u2019s joyously goofy 2018 under-the-sea extravaganza, Aquaman. Jason Momoa is back as the titular superhero\/sea king, with Nicole Kidman returning as his mother, Atlanna. Ben Affleck is reprising his role as Bruce Wayne\/Batman, Patrick Wilson is back as undersea usurper Orm the Ocean Master, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is back as the villain Black Manta, and Wan is back at the helm. But most of the early noise about Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has been about the return of Amber Heard as Aquaman\u2019s love interest, Mera \u2014 after the long, contentious legal battle between Heard and Johnny Depp, expect the lead-up conversation about this one to be noisy.\n2024\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux: Oct. 4\nTodd Phillips\u2019 acerbic 2019 drama Joker \u2014 effectively a DC-themed riff on Martin Scorsese\u2019s King of Comedy \u2014 didn\u2019t necessarily call for a sequel. It ends in a wide-open place that invites viewers to write their own next chapter. But nothing breeds sequels like success, and the first Joker was a billion-dollar hit for DC during a period where it was struggling to find that kind of payday from any of its properties. It feels like DC may have handed Phillips a blank check and a free rein \u2014 at least, that seems like the best way to explain why the Joker sequel is reportedly a musical thriller with \u200b\u200bJoaquin Phoenix reprising his role as Arthur Fleck\/the Joker, and Lady Gaga taking on the role of Harley Quinn. Zazie Beetz will be back as Arthur\u2019s neighbor and entirely unwitting love interest, Sophie.\nCreature Commandos\nJames Gunn is listed as the writer for this seven-episode adult animated series, which will also include Suicide Squad head Amanda Waller. This time, she \u201ccreates a black ops team out of monstrous prisoners.\u201d The team will include Frankenstein\u2019s monster (here called Eric Frankenstein and voiced by David Harbour), who has a long, complicated DC history of his own. The series is set to star Frank Grillo (Prison Break) as Rick Flag Sr., Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as Princess Ilana Rostovic, Indira Varma (Game of Thrones) as the Bride of Frankenstein, and Alan Tudyk (Harley Quinn) as Doctor Phosphorus.\nWaller\nGunn\u2019s hilarious, heartfelt Suicide Squad spinoff series Peacemaker was greenlit for a second season in February 2022, but Gunn has now said he\u2019s going to have to put that project on hold for a bit to concentrate on other things \u2014 including Waller, the previously untitled Peacemaker spinoff centered on Viola Davis as no-nonsense supervillain resource broker Amanda Waller. The character, introduced to DC\u2019s movie continuity in David Ayer\u2019s little-loved 2016 version of Suicide Squad (though she\u2019s been part of the comics continuity since 1986), is one of the few elements of Ayer\u2019s movie that was held over in Gunn\u2019s 2021 reboot\/reshuffle movie, called The Suicide Squad. She also turned up for a quick cameo in Black Adam. Now she\u2019s getting her own show \u2014 which \u201cfeatures Team Peacemaker,\u201d so it may feel like a stealth season 2, depending on who from the team winds up on the series.\n2025\nSuperman: Legacy: July 11\nThe first of the new Gunn\/Safran projects to actually get a release date, Superman: Legacy seems expressly designed to break the DCEU mold. Henry Cavill is moving on from the Superman role, and Gunn, who plans to script the film himself, made several pointed references to this film being a break from past visions of Superman: He called the film \u201cthe true foundation of [their] creative vision for the DC Universe,\u201d and said he \u201ccan\u2019t wait to introduce [their] version of Superman.\u201d The advance description for this one currently just says it\u2019ll feature the character \u201cbalancing his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing.\u201d\nThe Batman Part II: Oct. 3\nThe long, contentious history behind 2022\u2019s The Batman didn\u2019t leave much room for hope: As one of those movies that got bounced from team to team for years, changing shape at every bounce, it looked like a project that was destined to be driven more by market calculation than by a specific vision. But director and co-writer Matt Reeves found an effective take on the Dark Knight that resonated with audiences and landed solidly at the box office, and DC immediately greenlit a sequel, again with Robert Pattinson as the Caped Crusader. No plot details are clear yet, though Pattinson and Reeves have been blue-skying about a lot of things they\u2019d like to do: The Court of Owls storyline, maybe? Mr. Freeze? Calendar Man, for god\u2019s sake?\nUndated\nThe Penguin\nHBO Max\u2019s TV spinoff of Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman is meant to bridge the gap between that movie and Reeves\u2019 sequel, as Penguin (Colin Farrell) solidifies power in the Gotham underworld immediately after the death of Carmine Falcone (John Turturro) in the movie. The eight-episode series, produced by Reeves and overseen by Agents of SHIELD writer-producer Lauren LeFranc, is meant as a lead-in for The Batman Part II, so even though it\u2019s currently undated, expect it before the movie hits.\nArkham Asylum\nThe actual title for the second of Reeves\u2019 two HBO Max The Batman spinoffs hasn\u2019t been revealed yet, but this one is meant to be a prequel to the movie. Previously planned as a series about the workings of the Gotham police department, the series mutated in the development stage, and Boardwalk Empire creator Terence Winter, originally in charge of the series, departed the project. Reeves has described this series as an origin story for characters seen in Arkham in The Batman, with more of a horror movie or \u201chaunted house\u201d feel. The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos is now the showrunner for the series.\nA \u2018Black Superman\u2019 movie\nDC announced in early 2021 that writer Ta-Nehisi Coates would reboot Superman with a movie that would put a Black man in the title role. Details have been thin regarding whether this film would tie into an existing DC comics story \u2014 for instance, whether this might be a movie outing for temporary Superman successor Steel or a complete reimagining of the character \u2014 but the film was meant to be produced by J.J. Abrams under his Bad Robot imprint. Reportedly the project is still going forward in the wake of Gunn and Safran\u2019s new slate, but no release date has been announced.\nBrave and the Bold\nTaking its title from a silver age DC Comic, Brave and the Bold will introduce Batman\u2019s biological son Damian to the DCU \u2014 he\u2019s the fifth of Batman\u2019s many Robins \u2014 with a story inspired by Grant Morrison\u2019s interpretation of the character in the Batman and Son run of the Batman comic. This will be Damian\u2019s first appearance in a live-action film, though the character has appeared in animated form in TV and movies. The continuity of this film will be separate from Matt Reeves\u2019 planned The Batman trilogy; it\u2019s meant to establish the new DCU continuity for Batman and Robin.\nThe Authority\nThe WildStorm imprint \u2014 founded as an independent company in 1992 and bought up by DC in 1999 \u2014 maintained its own superhero universe separate from DC\u2019s, until DC shut it down in preparation for its characters to join the mainline DC Universe in the company\u2019s 2011 reboot. In its day, Wildstorm published independent and creator-owned comics, alongside superhero series like Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch\u2019s The Authority, about a group of seven heroes with high-concept superpowers, like the Engineer, a woman with nanotech blood, and Jack Hawksmoor, a man who psychically bonds to cities. This will be the first appearance of WildStorm canon in live-action film.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow\nJust as Superman: Legacy is meant to present a new view of Superman for the DCU, Woman of Tomorrow is being billed as \u201ca science fiction adventure\u201d that \u201cpresents a Supergirl viewers are not used to seeing.\u201d The movie will be based on Tom King\u2019s celebrated Supergirl comics, and will presumably not touch on anything from the six-year run of Supergirl on The CW starring \u200b\u200bMelissa Benoist.\nSwamp Thing\nThe recent appearance of Man-Thing in Marvel\u2019s black-and-white special Werewolf by Night suggested there can be space for mainstream superhero comics\u2019 occasional forays into EC Comics-style \u201cweird horror\u201d territory. But it\u2019ll be a while before we get to see what that looks like on the DC side. Swamp Thing, a plant-elemental hero who (depending on which comics you\u2019re reading) might or might not be a mutated version of scientist Alec Holland, dates back to 1971, and was successfully rebooted by Watchmen author Alan Moore in 1984. He\u2019s had several previous screen incarnations, including Wes Craven\u2019s 1982 movie Swamp Thing, a three-season USA Network Swamp Thing series starting in 1990, and a little-watched, quietly dropped one-season series in 2019. DC Studios says this movie \u201cwill investigate the dark origins of Swamp Thing.\u201d\nBooster Gold\nDC hasn\u2019t said much about this TV series, which brings the comics\u2019 fan-favorite comic-relief character to the screen for his own adventures. The company\u2019s logline for the show is just \u201cBooster Gold uses basic technology from the future to pretend to be a superhero in present day\u201d \u2014 which is pretty much Booster Gold\u2019s traditional comics depiction as well.\nLanterns\nThe 2011 live-action Green Lantern movie (starring Ryan Reynolds as original Green Lantern Hal Jordan) was such a legendary flop it scuttled DC\u2019s plans at the time for a new interconnected superhero universe, and Reynolds keeps finding new ways to publicly mock the film, especially in his Deadpool movies. This intergalactic-cop TV series will attempt to revive Hal Jordan for the screen, teaming him up with later Green Lantern John Stewart to \u201cuncover a dark mystery.\u201d\nParadise Lost\nThis series is set in Wonder Woman\u2019s home island of Themyscira, and DC\u2019s press release says it \u201cfocuses on the genesis and political intrigue of an island of all women.\u201d Sounds a bit like The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, in terms of turning a familiar fantasy story into a political origin story. It\u2019s unclear as of yet whether Wonder Woman herself will have a role in the story, and whether the series will connect with Patty Jenkins\u2019 Wonder Woman movies.\nSandman season 2\nNetflix announced in November 2022 that its live-action series Sandman, based on Neil Gaiman\u2019s seminal horror-fantasy comic, had been greenlit for a second season. No date has been announced yet, and given the scale of the visual effects involved in the first season, it\u2019s a fair bet that we won\u2019t see the second season until late 2024 or early 2025 at the earliest. Given that the first season covered the arcs of the first two Sandman graphic novels, Preludes and Nocturnes and The Doll\u2019s House (with side stories from the third volume, Dream Country), it\u2019s a fair bet that season 2 will continue with book four, Season of Mists, the heavily foreshadowed confrontation between Morpheus (Tom Sturridge) and Lucifer (Gwendoline Christie).\nDead Boy Detectives\nIn spite of a series of cancellations and shake-ups at Max, Neil Gaiman confirmed in January 2023 that the streamer\u2019s Sandman comics spinoff Dead Boy Detectives was actively in production. But that February, the news broke that Max had sold the series to Netflix, because it doesn\u2019t fit with James Gunn\u2019s plans for Warner Bros. DC content. The series is based on a pair of ghost boys, Charles Rowland and Edwin Paine, who were introduced in Sandman\u2019s Season of Mists storyline and later got their own 2001 comics miniseries. They also turned up in season 3 of Max\u2019s Doom Patrol series. The initial press release on Dead Boy Detectives said it would have an eight-episode first season, described as \u201ca fresh take on a ghost story that explores loss, grief, and death through the lens of Edwin Payne (George Rexstrew) and Charles Rowland (Jayden Revri), two dead British teenagers, and their very alive friend, Crystal Palace (Kassius Nelson).\u201d\nPeacemaker season 2\nAlongside everything else in this universe with his name on it, Gunn hasn\u2019t forgotten Peacemaker. According to the director, Christopher Smith will be making his return for season 2, sometime after Gunn wraps production on Superman: Legacy. This likely means that season 2 won\u2019t be coming along until sometime in 2025 or even later, but hey, at least we know it\u2019s out there.\n\nThis article, authored by Tasha Robinson, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-24 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":81}
{"title":"Mary Jane in Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 Is a Disguised Superhero, in a Good Way","context":"## Mary Jane in Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 Is a Disguised Superhero, in a Good Way\n\nWith the recent release of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has witnessed a huge appreciation from fans for delivering a memorable sequel. Not to mention the epic portrayal of Peter Parker and Miles Morales fighting against some of the strongest villains. But then, there\u2019s MJ as well who has made a comeback from the first installment. And it\u2019s her arc that has actually received an impressive elevation this time. Especially when considering the poorly received missions featuring Mary Jane in the original game from 2018.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nSo what\u2019s actually changed in 2023 that has created a vast difference? There are certain key reasons making Mary Jane in Spider-Man 2 a treat to watch. Not just from the perspective of her relationship with Peter, but her own missions showcasing a different side this time. One can even call her the third unofficial superhero in the latest PS5 exclusive.\nA refreshing take on Mary Jane\u2019s stealth missions makes her a strong character in Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIn the first title, stepping into MJ\u2019s shoes was a great concept, but the devs somehow couldn\u2019t execute the plan flawlessly. As a result, missions featuring her as a playable character were heavily criticized by most of the fans. There was nothing too special about those quests whatsoever.\nNow, looking at Mary Jane in Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2, there\u2019s a very clear difference one can make out. In short, it feels comparing night and day. Being a journalist at The Daily Bugle, her character is bound to go places in order to investigate mysteries. The first game had such situations, but the sequel improved on them. It gives MJ a lot more strength instead of being someone who always needs to be rescued in the last moment. But how?\nCompared to the lack of interactivity in 2018\u2019s Spider-Man, MJ is now capable of tackling the enemies around her. In the first title, all she could do was to move from one point to the other. Now, she\u2019s able to do more than that \u2013 make pretty good and lethal moves. To be precise, the devs have given MJ a little firepower, if not in too much capacity. Now, she\u2019s got weapons instead of being clueless in moments of being vulnerable against armed enemies. Yes, she hasn\u2019t got any superpowers, but she\u2019s got other means to help herself out.\nDue to such involvement, players have now got a reason to be more invested into a given mission focusing on MJ. It wasn\u2019t the case at all taking into consideration her previous iteration in Insomniac\u2019s original game. Mary Jane can now handle the circumstances in her own manner, thus breaking free from the linear approach of just trying to hide and escape.\nMJ in Spider-Man 2 vs. MJ from Insomniac\u2019s 2018 installment\nWhile there are similarities between the character\u2019s iterations in two titles, a lot of drastic differences are also present. Speaking of similar aspects, the first game had a mission where Mary gets to use a taser to shock the guards. Well there\u2019s no taser in Spider-Man 2, she\u2019s got a stun gun now.\nThen, there are moments of hiding and sneaking past the enemies. In the original game, there were missions like the one in Grand Central Station where MJ had to stay hidden from a number of Mr. Negative\u2019s demons to defuse a bomb. Similarly, in Spider-Man 2, MJ is seen hiding from the hunters during the \u2018Wake Up\u2019 quest. But what\u2019s actually changed?\nWell, the very difference lies in the lack of MJ\u2019s abilities in the first game and how she\u2019s evolved in the second. Coming back to the \u2018Wake Up\u2019 mission, she\u2019s seen sneaking past the hunters but she\u2019s also capable of performing Takedowns on them. It wasn\u2019t the case in the previous title. Her missions have become better now with the devs actually spending time on giving her a chance to fight.\nComing back to the stun gun part, MJ is pretty skilled in using it, during missions like \u2018Good Men\u2019, thanks to her training with Sable. Also, now she\u2019s got the option to even run away and hide when spotted by enemies. The playability factor around her has increased a lot compared to being just an observer, for the most part, in the first game. That\u2019s the biggest and most visible difference.\nMary Jane and her missions in Spider-Man 2 allow the story to proceed without causing a problem for the central protagonists\nThe best thing about going through the quests showcasing Mary Jane is that they never try to overpower the ongoing story itself. The game\u2019s narrative remains intact, no matter what. There never occurs a feeling of the devs trying too hard to make it seem like her missions are stretching out of their boundaries.\nAlthough they are designed well this time but one has to commend Insomniac\u2019s team to keep a limit on not making MJ\u2019s gameplay moments seem forced or going beyond a certain point. They serve their purpose without affecting the main plot of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 or overlapping with Peter or Miles\u2019 stories. In a way, each character has been given a good amount of time to shine. At times, it may feel like MJ\u2019s playable sequences should have been extended. But it\u2019s nice to see that the devs decided to not do that; sometimes less is more and fine.\nDespite Spider-Man 2 being more of a Peter\u2019s story (in its entirety), MJ\u2019s role has been given equal significance too. There\u2019s a visible growth in her arc especially considering her profession as a journalist. Yes, she\u2019s Peter\u2019s love interest, but that\u2019s not everything she\u2019s there for. Players can easily see it happening throughout the game\u2019s duration.\nThe verdict?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nIt\u2019s obvious to expect that a lot of fans who didn\u2019t like MJ\u2019s missions in the first installment won\u2019t like her this time as well. But considering how she was before and how she\u2019s in Spider-Man 2, the overall change is quite praiseworthy. Things are different this time, thankfully.\nMJ\u2019s missions are now having some actual meaning attached to them rather than acting like fillers. Players who want to have a few interesting moments aside from the main quests featuring Miles and Peter can have a sense of finishing well-designed stealth quests. Mary\u2019s gameplay missions end up increasing the overall quality of Spider-Man 2. All things considered, it is great to see Insomniac improving on this aspect instead of removing it completely.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 is now available on PlayStation 5 worldwide.\nWatch This Story: The Console Wars Are Heating Head-to-Head: Xbox and PlayStation Fans Battle Over Which Custom Controller is Better, Starfield or Spider-Man 2?\n\nThis article, authored by Mintu Tomar, was published by Essentially Sports on 2023-11-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":82}
{"title":"Sam Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t ask where the $8 billion went","context":"## Sam Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t ask where the $8 billion went\n\nLet\u2019s say I am the owner of a hedge fund, and one fine June day, my employees come to me and say, \u201cHey, Liz, we have an accounting problem. We are missing several billion dollars.\u201d How would I react?\nI have been wondering this since Danielle Sassoon walked Sam Bankman-Fried through his reaction to the FTX software bug fixed by Adam Yedidia. In my case, there would probably be shouting? Like, a lot of shouting. I would also probably have my assistant figure out which law enforcement agency to call immediately. Misplacing $900 million is a five-alarm fire even for Citibank; misplacing several billion is kicking over a lantern in Chicago in 1871.\nObviously, this is not how Bankman-Fried reacted to the software bug that overestimated the amount Alameda owed to FTX by about $8 billion. Nor is it how he reacted to finding out that even after fixing the bug, Alameda still owed FTX about $8 billion. Instead, Bankman-Fried directed alleged co-conspirator Caroline Ellison to repay third-party loans and went on making investments.\nBankman-Fried said that he found out about the fiat@ftx account \u2014 that\u2019s the one that tracked how much Alameda owed FTX \u2014 in June 2022 while his senior staff was focused on fixing the software bug. He did not, however, discover what the account was for until October. I know this sounds unbelievable, but this is his actual testimony.\nHis employees told him \u201cthey were busy and I should stop asking questions because it was distracting.\u201d\nSimple questions nailed Bankman-Fried to the wall. Had he given his employees at Alameda the direction not to spend FTX customer deposits? Had he put in any policies to prevent Alameda employees from spending FTX customer money? Did he put in place any measures at Alameda to protect the FTX customer money? No, no, and no. Oh, but he was testifying to Congress about keeping customer funds safe.\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\nWho was making decisions to spend $8 billion of customer funds? Bankman-Fried couldn\u2019t recall knowing anything about it. Were there rules or requirements for how money borrowed from FTX would be returned? Were there rules for risk management? \u201cI was concerned with overall risk management,\u201d Bankman-Fried said.\nBut it was the testimony about June 2022 that resonated the most to me. Didn\u2019t Bankman-Fried ask what \u201cfiat@ftx\u201d was? He did. But \u2014 I did hear these words uttered aloud in a court of law this morning, I am not creative enough to make this kind of thing up \u2014 his employees told him \u201cthey were busy and I should stop asking questions because it was distracting.\u201d\nYedidia \u2014 Bankman-Fried\u2019s college friend, Bahamas roommate, and employee at FTX \u2014 had testified that he\u2019d asked Bankman-Fried about the $8 billion hole on a padel tennis court in their luxury complex in June or July. Today, in testimony, Bankman-Fried seemed to be trying to deny that conversation had ever taken place. It was not until Judge Lewis Kaplan intervened to ask if Bankman-Fried had ever been told by Yedidia about that money, in words or in substance, that Bankman-Fried admitted he\u2019d been told.\nI have come to believe that if you know the meaning of the word \u201cepistemology,\u201d you absolutely should not testify in your own defense\n\u201cSo it\u2019s your testimony that your supervisees told you to stop asking questions?\u201d Sassoon asked. She could have been filing her nails, her tone was so level. Had Bankman-Fried called anyone in to ask who spent $8 billion? \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to build out blame for it,\u201d he said. He was focused on solutions! Did he fire anyone? Nope!\nWe also saw an Alameda balance sheet from June 13th, 2022, that included the money it was borrowing from FTX as \u201cftx borrows.\u201d Bankman-Fried seemed pretty hazy on this, too.\nIf you are wondering how Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents reacted to this, I can\u2019t tell you \u2014 they weren\u2019t there. I couldn\u2019t really blame them. I wouldn\u2019t want to watch my child be vivisected, either. The jurors, however, watched the operation attentively. I suppose for most of us, $8 billion has a way of focusing the mind.\nLook, uttering phrases like \u201chole isn\u2019t really the word I would use\u201d and responding to a question by saying you wanted \u201ca few more qualifiers and scoping on it\u201d do not, as a general rule, bode well for your believability. Yes, this will win certain kinds of nerd arguments. But this is a courtroom, and I have come to believe that if you know the meaning of the word \u201cepistemology,\u201d you absolutely should not testify in your own defense.\n\u201cHis name is Ryan Salame :p\u201d\nBankman-Fried, like Theranos\u2019 Elizabeth Holmes before him, got on the stand to speak directly to his state of mind in a way no other witness can. But telling your side of the story opens you to a great many questions you might not want to answer on cross-examination. I have watched a lot of crosses. This was the nastiest I think I\u2019ve ever seen.\nThe charges in this case hinge on conspiracy and intentional deceit. Just losing $8 billion is not a crime, though it is very embarrassing. (Even losing $900 million is very embarrassing because people will make jokes about it forever!) But if Bankman-Fried lied to customers and lenders about what he was doing and how safe FTX was, that\u2019s a crime.\nEstablishing that would have been enough, but Sassoon also managed to get in some flourishes about Bankman-Fried\u2019s relationships to Bahamian power. For instance, she asked him if he\u2019d made comments about paying off the Bahamian national debt. (You will be shocked, shocked to discover he didn\u2019t recall.) We then saw an internal FTX group chat called \u201cProject Chinchilla Chatter\u201d in which another member asked who in the Bahamian government they needed to talk to for the project. \u201cHis name is Ryan Salame :p,\u201d Bankman-Fried replied. Salame was one of FTX\u2019s executives.\nIn another part of the chat, Bankman-Fried noted that the Bahamian prime minister was at the FTX arena in FTX seats with his wife.\nWe then saw a November 9th email from Bankman-Fried to Ryan Pinder, attorney general of the Bahamas, that said \u201cwe are deeply grateful\u201d for what the Bahamas had done for FTX. As a token of that gratitude, Bankman-Fried wrote:\nWe would be more than happy to open up withdrawals for all Bahamian customers on FTX, so that they can, tomorrow, fully withdraw all of their assets, making them fully whole. It\u2019s your call whether you want us to do this, but we are more than happy to and would consider it the very least of our duty to the country, and could open it up immediately if you reply saying you want us to. If we don\u2019t hear back from you, we are going to go ahead and do it tomorrow.\nBankman-Fried did indeed open withdrawals for Bahamian customers. The upshot of this testimony seemed to be that Bankman-Fried had a cozy, perhaps even inappropriately cozy, relationship with the Bahamian government \u2014 which isn\u2019t what he\u2019s on trial for but probably doesn\u2019t make him look any better to a jury.\nSassoon successfully established yesterday that Bankman-Fried has a long history of dishonesty. Today, through a set of questions about what Bankman-Fried did and didn\u2019t do, she established that the story he told on direct examination was absurd. After a brief redirect examination by Bankman-Fried\u2019s own lawyers, which was resplendent with word salad, Bankman-Fried stepped down, and the defense rested their case.\n\nThis article, authored by Elizabeth Lopatto, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-31 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":83}
{"title":"La desigualdad del estr\u00e9s por calor","context":"## La desigualdad del estr\u00e9s por calor\n\nThis is an authorized translation of an Eos article. Esta es una traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol autorizada de un art\u00edculo de Eos.\nCuando cada verano temperaturas r\u00e9cord y domos de calor envuelven amplias zonas de los Estados Unidos, las personas experimentan estos eventos de calor extremo de manera diferente. Aquellos que viven en vecindarios hist\u00f3ricamente marginalizados, donde el uso de la tierra y las pol\u00edticas de vivienda discriminatorias hicieron que la segregaci\u00f3n y el racismo florecieran, al d\u00eda de hoy a\u00fan presentan mayor riesgo por las temperaturas altas y los efectos del estr\u00e9s por calor en la salud.\nEn un nuevo estudio publicado por One Earth, investigadores demostraron que en 481 ciudades estadounidenses el estr\u00e9s por calor afecta a las personas pobres y de color desproporcionalmente. \u201cEncontramos que la disparidad actual era bastante consistente entre las ciudades: en m\u00e1s del 90% de las ciudades que consideramos, encontramos desigualdades a la exposici\u00f3n al calor relacionadas tanto en los ingresos como en la raza\u201d, dijo TC Chakraborty, cient\u00edfico de la Tierra en el Laboratorio Nacional del Noroeste Pac\u00edfico y autor principal del estudio. Este tipo de informaci\u00f3n puede ayudar a los l\u00edderes de ciudad a usar mejores medidas de las disparidades del calor, as\u00ed como proteger a las poblaciones en mayor riesgo de exposici\u00f3n al calor.\nEl peligro del calor implacable\nLas islas de calor urbano, zonas calientes de la ciudad donde el asfalto, alta densidad de edificios e infraestructura causan que la temperatura aumente m\u00e1s que en las \u00e1reas circundantes, albergan millones de personas que no son capaces de escapar de los efectos del implacable calor del verano.\nLa exposici\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica al calor excesivo tiene un impacto en la salud cardiovascular, respiratoria y mental.\n\u201cLas personas que viven en zonas urbanas suelen caminar para hacer sus tareas diarias. Una de las ventajas de vivir en una ciudad es que las cosas est\u00e1n cerca y puedes utilizar el transporte p\u00fablico, pero eso tambi\u00e9n significa que tienes que pasar m\u00e1s tiempo al aire libre\u201d, dijo Neelima Tummala, m\u00e9dico y co-directora del Instituto de Salud Ambiental en la Universidad George Washington, quien no estuvo involucrada en el estudio.\nEn vecindarios sin parques ni \u00e1rboles grandes, donde el asfalto y los edificios absorben e irradian el calor del verano, a los residentes les puede resultar dif\u00edcil escapar de las temperaturas extremas tanto en interiores como en el exterior. Este tipo de exposici\u00f3n continua puede ser muy peligrosa. El cuerpo se vuelve incapaz de enfriarse adecuadamente mediante la sudoraci\u00f3n. La exposici\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica al calor excesivo tiene un impacto en la salud cardiovascular, respiratoria y mental, dijo Tummala. \u201cLa exposici\u00f3n prolongada a temperaturas nocturnas elevadas puede afectar la calidad del sue\u00f1o y la salud mental y cardiaca,\u201d dijo. \u201cEst\u00e1s constantemente a una temperatura elevada con la que tu cuerpo tiene que lidiar\u201d.\nMapeando la disparidad de calor\nEstudios previos sobre el calor urbano han utilizado datos satelitales para estimar temperaturas de la superficie terrestre. En cambio, Chackraborty y sus colegas evaluaron el estr\u00e9s por calor utilizando el \u00edndice de calor del Servicio Nacional Meteorol\u00f3gico de los E.E. U.U. y el \u00edndice de humedad del Servicio Nacional Meteorol\u00f3gico de Canad\u00e1 (humidex), combinando la temperatura del aire y la humedad para describir mejor c\u00f3mo se siente el calor. Utilizar modelos que combinan estas variables fue una manera m\u00e1s certera de catalogar el estr\u00e9s por calor de las ciudades estadounidenses entre 2014 y 2018.\nLa correlaci\u00f3n de los \u00edndices de calor mapeados con los datos del censo revel\u00f3 que los vecindarios de bajos ingresos y los residentes de color experimentaron temperaturas m\u00e1s altas y mayor humedad, lo que en conjunto amplifica el estr\u00e9s por calor. Las zonas censales con mayores ingresos sufrieron menos estr\u00e9s por calor. El estr\u00e9s por calor tambi\u00e9n fue generalmente mayor en las zonas con un mayor porcentaje de residentes negros y afroamericanos.\n\u00c1reas censales de Baltimore coloreadas seg\u00fan el \u00edndice de calor y el porcentaje de residentes negros. Una comparaci\u00f3n indica que donde una mayor proporci\u00f3n de residentes son negros, el estr\u00e9s por calor es mayor. Cr\u00e9dito: TC Chakraborty\/PNNL\nUn mapa de 1938 de Brooklyn, Nueva York, del Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation muestra vecindarios codificados por colores seg\u00fan el valor del pr\u00e9stamo. Las \u00e1reas en rojo (barrios marginalizados) indican \u00e1reas donde los bancos y otros prestamistas generalmente consideraban que los residentes no eran dignos de ser incluidos en los programas de pr\u00e9stamos y propiedad de vivienda. Los barrios marginalizados ten\u00edan un n\u00famero desproporcionado de residentes negros. Cr\u00e9dito: Corporaci\u00f3n de Pr\u00e9stamos para Propietarios de Vivienda, Dominio P\u00fablico\nLos investigadores compararon estos hallazgos con datos hist\u00f3ricos de 177 ciudades para observar m\u00e1s a fondo esta disparidad de ingresos y raza a trav\u00e9s del tiempo. En la d\u00e9cada de 1930, el gobierno de los Estados Unidos calific\u00f3 a los vecindarios seg\u00fan su capacidad de inversi\u00f3n. Muchos de los vecindarios que albergaban poblaciones pobres y minoritarias, especialmente de residentes negros y afroamericanos, fueron considerados inversiones mas riesgosas y, por lo tanto, recibieron menos fondos para desarrollo y programas de vivienda. Hoy d\u00eda, estos vecindarios marginalizados sufren condiciones ambientales mucho peores que otras partes de sus respectivas ciudades. Tienen menos cubierta de \u00e1rboles y experimentan temperaturas superficiales mayores que vecindarios que originalmente no fueron marginalizados.\nLas disparidades eran penetrantes, dijo Chakraborty. Los vecindarios marginalizados, generalmente calificados con una \u201cD\u201d por prestamistas, ten\u00edan un \u00edndice de calor mayor comparado con aquellos que eran calificados con una \u201cA\u201d. \u201cEste resultado fue muy interesante \u2013 que este nivel de desigualdad y segregaci\u00f3n se correlacionara tan fuertemente con los niveles de disparidad de calor,\u201d dijo.\nProteger a los m\u00e1s vulnerables\n\u201cEstudios como este, que buscan comprender m\u00e1s a fondo las disparidades existentes en la exposici\u00f3n al calor, son importantes para identificar qu\u00e9 comunidades corren mayor riesgo de sufrir cambios ambientales relacionados al cambio clim\u00e1tico, como el calor extremo que cada vez empeora m\u00e1s\u201d, dijo Tummala. Se necesitan medidas de salud p\u00fablica y estrategias de mitigaci\u00f3n para proteger a los ciudadanos con mayor riesgo de sufrir calor \u2013 especialmente cuando el aumento de las temperaturas se vuelve m\u00e1s com\u00fan.\n\u201cZonas con menos \u00e1rboles en las calles, menos acceso a espacios verdes\u2014All\u00ed es donde se comienza a ver el legado de la desinversi\u00f3n y el racismo institucional que ha entrado en juego\u201d.\n\u201cZonas con menos \u00e1rboles en las calles, menos acceso a espacios verdes\u2014All\u00ed es donde se comienza a ver el legado de la desinversi\u00f3n y el racismo institucional que ha entrado en juego\u201d, dijo Lara Whitely Binder, gerente del programa de preparaci\u00f3n clim\u00e1tica del condado de King County, Washington, quien no estuvo involucrada en la investigaci\u00f3n.\nDebido a que el clima est\u00e1 cambiando y avanzando, de ahora en adelante las ciudades deben prepararse para veranos m\u00e1s calientes y olas de calor mortales m\u00e1s frecuentes usando distintos medios, tanto en los interiores como al aire libre. \u201cNo solo necesitamos entender mejor d\u00f3nde hace calor, sino tambi\u00e9n cu\u00e1les son los factores socioecon\u00f3micos para los habitantes de esas zonas\u201d, dijo Whitely Binder. \u201cPodemos comenzar a analizar lo que hay en las islas de calor y utilizarlo para comenzar a informar las decisiones pol\u00edticas que vamos a tomar\u201d.\n\u2014Rebecca Owen (@beccapox), Escritora de ciencia\nThis translation by Nel Rodriguez Sepulveda was made possible by a partnership with Planeteando.

This time, we speak to Abdul Karim Abdullah, Co-Founder and CEO of Ghana-based cultural entertainment platform AfroFuture. Trailblazers is supported by TuneCore.\nThe spotlight continues to shine on Africa\u2019s music business.\nSub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was the world\u2019s fastest-growing recorded music region in 2022, seeing 34.7% YoY growth (IFPI) last year, and the growth opportunity for subscription music streaming in the SSA region is becoming significantly clearer.\nAfrica-focused music streaming service Mdundo, for example, recently reported a 239% YoY jump in revenue from paid subscriptions, with the company recording a 23.2% YoY increase in monthly active users (MAUs). Geographically, the streaming company\u2019s focus is on five key SSA markets: Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana and South Africa.\nAccording to a 2022 report from GSMA, 615 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are expected to sign up for mobile services by 2025, on top of the roughly 500 million that were already subscribed as of 2020.\nIn Ghana, live music brand AfroFuture is tapping into what co-founder Abdul Karim Abdullah says is \u201clargely upwardly mobile, tech-forward Gen Z and millennial consumers\u201d to pursue its ambitions of becoming the \u201cstoryteller for the African narrative\u201d.\nThe music, art, and culture festival (formerly known as Afrochella) was launched in Accra in 2017, and in addition to the core music festival, it offers travel experiences and runs various non-profit initiatives. This year\u2019s edition, in December, will be headlined by superstars like Afrobeats star Davido and British rapper and singer J-Hus.\nAbdullah, (also AfroFuture\u2019s CEO) explains in our interview below that the AfroFuture brand \u201chas grown tremendously since its inception\u201d.\nThe inaugural festival took place on December 29, 2017, at the Accra Polo Court, attracting 4,600 attendees. \u201cWe knew we had something special,\u201d says Abdullah.\n\u201cFrom there, we chose to expand our team support and in 2018, we looked to formalize our partnership with media agency, BBnZ Live, for digital content generation and event management support.\u201d\nBy 2022, the event had morphed into a two-day festival under the AfroFuture banner with superstars Burna Boy and Stonebwoy as headliners, and sponsors ranging from Hennessy and Diageo, to Fenty Beauty, and TuneCore.\nHeld at the end of December last year, the sixth annual AfroFuture festival (now held at the at EL Wak Stadium) attracted 31,000 attendees over two days.\n\u201cWe realized that there was an opportunity for us to bring the community and the diaspora together in a way that hadn\u2019t been done before in the country.\u201d Abdul Karim Abdullah, AfroFuture\nAbdullah, who grew up in the Bronx, explains that he decided to launch the event after one of his first visits to Ghana with co-founder Kenny Agyapong.\n\u201cWe realized that there was an opportunity for us to bring the community and the diaspora together in a way that hadn\u2019t been done before in the country,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWith our influence, we had the opportunity to stimulate conversation, elevate our people, and tell authentic stories from the continent. As a result, AfroFuture, formally known as Afrochella, was born and planted its roots in Accra, Ghana.\u201d\nHere, we speak with AfroFuture\u2019s CEO about the event\u2019s origins, its growth trajectory, and his ambitions for the event in the coming years\u2026\nHow did you first get into the music business?\nMy first experience in the music industry was when a member of my fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc., booked Big Sean at my alma mater, Syracuse University.\nI remember how much I enjoyed the experience because I was fascinated by how everything came together and the process of creating and managing an event. From that experience, I got my big break as a stage manager for a concert I pitched to W&R Productions for El and Joey B, two major Ghanaian artists, at the Gramercy Theatre\nFrom those early experiences, I found the confidence I needed to create, plan, and execute my own event. The only thing left was figuring out how to fund my big ideas. From my first event to then establishing AfroFuture, I\u2019ve gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and it has been the driving force behind everything that I do to create sustainable change for not only Ghana but for Africa at large.\nTell us about your journey from there and how and why you decided to launch Afrofuture?\nAfter one of my visits to Ghana with my co-founder Kenny Agyapong, we realized that there was an opportunity for us to bring the community and the diaspora together in a way that hadn\u2019t been done before in the country. With our influence, we had the opportunity to stimulate conversation, elevate our people, and tell authentic stories from the continent. As a result, AfroFuture, formally known as Afrochella, was born and planted its roots in Accra, Ghana.\nOnce Kenny and I agreed on the vision, we looked to build a small but mighty team to create our vision: To bring African art, cuisine, fashion, and music to a global audience, paving the way for additional opportunities that are for us, by us, and celebrate us. Once we established our vision, we mapped our north star \u2013 a mission(s) that would guide all that we do and will do for the continent:\nPromote networking and ownership within the Ghanaian community and Pan-African Diaspora.\nEnsure that Africans living around the world understand the importance of celebrating their native cultures and investing in it.\nServe as an informational vessel connecting the African Diaspora with current news, fashion, art, music, and business opportunities in Africa.\nUtilize community influence to ensure educational support for Ghanaian and African students worldwide.\nOnce we had our foundation in place, we set out to launch our inaugural festival held at the Accra Polo Court On December 29, 2017.\nWho is AfroFuture\u2019s target audience, and where are they from geographically?\nAfroFuture is a global platform that invites people from all over the world, and is an event for those who enjoy the intersection of music, food, fashion, and art.\nOur brand resonates with the global Black diaspora, and we\u2019ve received significant support from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Caribbean and neighboring African countries. Our attendees are largely upwardly mobile, tech-forward Gen Z and millennial consumers who are committed to the culture and represent over 40 countries across the globe.\nAbout 45% of our audience attends the Festival from North America, 13% from Europe and Asia and about 12% come from African countries outside of Ghana and South Africa.\nCan you tell us more about the Rising Star Challenge?\nOur annual \u2018Rising Star Challenge\u2019 is one of our flagship competitions for unsigned and emerging artists in Africa. The \u2018Rising Star Challenge\u2019 is our way of supporting live music not only in Ghana, but throughout Africa. To enter into the contest, artists upload an original song to Audiomack and create an Instagram Reel that includes an introduction about the artist, their approach to music and the music-making process, and what they want their potential audience to know about their style of music.\nAs an exciting lead-up to the festival, 10 musicians are chosen from a shortlist of 25 unsigned and emerging artists. From there, five finalists are chosen to perform on AfroFuture\u2019s Rising Star Stage alongside the festival\u2019s headliners.\n\u201cOur annual \u2018Rising Star Challenge\u2019 is one of our flagship competitions for unsigned and emerging artists in Africa.\u201d\nFor the grand finale, one artist from the \u201cRising Star Challenge\u201d is selected for the ultimate prize \u2013 an exclusive recording agreement with Sony Music Africa for a single release. In addition, winners receive global distribution for their new single, marketing support such as a music video and more, free access to AfroFuture\u2019s recording studio and mentoring and training from industry executives and leading musicians and producers.\nIn 2022, we took things up a notch by introducing an expansion to the \u201cRising Star Challenge\u201d with the addition of the \u201cRising Star DJ Challenge,\u201d a call for DJs from across the diaspora to share their talents with our audience and to have the chance to grace the stage at our AfroFuture festival.\nIn partnership with TuneCore, this initiative was created in an effort to amplify the next generation of African superstars and to find the next breakout DJ from the continent.\nTo roll out the contest, the top ten entries were selected by a panel of industry experts composed of TuneCore executives and AfroFuture DJs. Once announced, fans across the world voted on social media to narrow the group down to three DJs. From there, the top three finalists battled it out at the AfroFuture Music Museum in Accra, Ghana on December 27 and the contest winner performed at AfroFuture 2022 and walked away with a cash prize.\nTell us about the impact that Afrofuture has had on the country\u2019s local tourism industry\u2026\nThe local impact of AfroFuture is significant. Every year, we make an effort to employ Ghanians to aid our festival and surrounding activities to support the local community.\nIn 2019 alone, AfroFuture helped bring in $2.1 billion in tourism revenue for \u201cYear of Return\u201d and the festival is expected to generate approximately 16% of the country\u2019s tourism [this year].\nMost international visitors associate Ghana with our festival and every year, we try to make a more sustainable impact on the country to ensure that opportunities continue to exist outside of December [when the event takes place].\nAs a result of our incredible impact on Ghana and the African continent, myself and [AfroFuture\u2019s] co-founders were named Goodwill Ambassador of Tourism to Ghana to help promote the country\u2019s tourism globally.\nAs one of the flagship events hosted in Ghana, we had the exciting challenge of bringing 20,000 visitors to the country and establishing Ghana as the premier destination for all travelers worldwide.\nWhat are your ambitions for AfroFuture over the coming years?\nWe\u2019re seeking to continue to strengthen our narrative within our primary pillars of food, art, fashion, and music as well as striving towards a united diaspora. Our future is bright and is currently manifesting itself through our extended global activities like \u2018Road to AfroFuture.\u2019\nAs we previously shared, in 2022, we launched our \u2018Road to AfroFuture\u2019 experiential popup activation to catapult our brand into the Sub-Saharan market. Since the launch of this initiative in 2022, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to expand our presence to the UK, South Africa, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and France.\nAs we continue to gain momentum and garner more popularity around our \u201cRoad to Afrofuture\u201d events, we\u2019ll aim to explore additional locations and expand our reach to more diverse markets.\nWhat is the AfroFuture Foundation?\nThe AfroFuture Foundation is a program we established to give back to the local Ghanaian community in a long-term and meaningful way. Through our philanthropy efforts, we\u2019re able to connect with local groups and international charities to educate and feed students and families in Accra. Our foundation goals are strategically aligned with the United Nations\u2019 17 sustainable development goals.\nIn 2017, we had the opportunity to collaborate with local schools within Madina Zongo, Greater Accra, and Kumasi Ashanti Region, to provide $5,000 in school supplies (notebooks, pads, pencils, pens, erasers, textbooks) and bookbags. This initiative was our initial commitment to the 4th sustainable development goal of quality education. The following year, we partnered with the Water Aid Foundation and raised 10,500 Ghana Cedis (over $2,000) to provide clean water to families in need in the Northern Region of Ghana.\nIn 2018, we partnered with Twitter Blackbirds (ERG) and AirBnB for two initiatives: AfroFuture Reads and AfroFuture Feeds. Through this partnership, we raised $10,500 to renovate and remodel the Genesis School of Orphans In Jamestown, Greater Accra Region. The school was recently demolished, and the land sold, leaving students to study under tents for the remainder of their last term. AfroFuture invited the African diaspora to aid students with school supplies and a stable learning environment through monetary donations to help us collectivity reach our goal fostering the importance of \u201cQuality Education.\u201d\nThrough our AfroFuture Feeds initiative, our mission is to bring awareness to and eradicate hunger in Ghana. Through Ghana\u2019s SDG, \u201cZero Hunger,\u201d we aid the nation by providing meals via food trucks and direct donations to various Ghanaian communities during volunteer opportunities with both [AfroFuture] staff and participants. We\u2019ve raised over $5,000 to feed 500 families within five impoverished neighborhoods in Ghana.\nIn 2021, AfroFuture Feeds welcomed 72 volunteers to help hand out 500 packaged meals and water. In 2022, we welcomed over 250 volunteers and delivered groceries to families across Accra and to surrounding communities.\nYou are running events in South Africa and in New York \u2013 are there plans to expand the brand into other markets?\nYes, we intend to expand the AfroFuture brand and events to additional Francophone African nations and other markets in order to attract more partnership opportunities and reach a wider, more diverse audience.\nWe\u2019ve seen incredible success with our South Africa events with over 1,000 attendees in 2022 and in 2023. In New York, we\u2019ve partnered with some incredible brands like Positive Vibes Only (PVO) and Days Like This (DLT) to create fresh and fun events for our dedicated audiences to enjoy in the States.\nIf there was one thing you could change about the music industry, what would it be and why?\nThe one thing I would change about the music industry is to focus on the product rather than the profit. Profit as a metric has lowered the caliber of the content we consume. I feel like it has diluted the purity of music.\nWhat advice would you give to an aspiring entrepreneur in the music industry?\nMy advice to an aspiring entrepreneur would be to remain true to your purpose and to always be authentic. With discipline and a solid foundation around you, you can reach your desired level of success \u2013 even when you meet adversity or when doors continue to close \u2013 you must never give up.\nTrailblazers is supported by TuneCore.

{"title":"Sam Bankman-Fried was a terrible boyfriend","context":"## Sam Bankman-Fried was a terrible boyfriend\n\nI\u2019ve got some shitty ex-boyfriends, but none of them made me the CEO of their sin-eater hedge fund while refusing to give me equity and bragging about how there was a 5 percent chance they\u2019d become the president of the United States, you know? Absolutely counting my blessings after Caroline Ellison\u2019s first day on the stand. I wonder how many of the nine women on the jury are doing the same.\nEllison was the head of Alameda Research, the aforementioned hedge fund, during the implosion of it and FTX. She\u2019s already pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from one of the worst romantic relationships I\u2019ve ever heard of, and her testimony was widely anticipated before the trial. Today, that took the form of discussing a damning spreadsheet \u2014 one she prepared for her ex and boss Sam Bankman-Fried, now the defendant in a criminal fraud trial.\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\nThe day started off promisingly for the defense as it cross-examined Gary Wang, the chief technology officer of FTX and co-owner of both FTX and Alameda. Christian Everdell, one of Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense attorneys, couldn\u2019t undo the damage of last week\u2019s code review. But he managed to shake the rust off long enough to make Wang sound less reliable, drowning the jury in confusing technicalities.\nLast week, Wang testified that Alameda got access to a special credit line and an option to take its balance into the negative without triggering liquidation \u2014 something he alleged other accounts at FTX didn\u2019t get. Everdell tried to undermine this claim by talking about the spot margin program, which let users lend each other assets for margin trading. In those cases, it was possible to have a negative balance in a specific coin. It was not, however, possible for those accounts to avoid liquidation, as Wang testified Alameda could do \u2014 or to have an overall negative balance. But I\u2019m betting the defense is hoping the jurors will throw up their hands in confusion thinking about this.\n\u201cWe ultimately took about $14 billion, some of which we were not able to pay back.\u201d\nWang didn\u2019t exactly help himself out, either. Apparently, what Wang said in court contradicted something he\u2019d said in earlier interviews with the government about market making. I say \u201capparently\u201d because Everdell was probably giving him his previous testimony to refresh his recollection, but Wang was insisting he didn\u2019t remember. In any event, whatever Wang was shown wasn\u2019t submitted as evidence or shown to the court. I got the gist, though, and I bet the jury did, too \u2014 probably the strongest work the defense has done so far.\nBut by the end of the day, that all seemed like a sideshow. Bankman-Fried had been vibrating slightly during Wang\u2019s testimony. During Ellison\u2019s testimony, his bouncing became more noticeable.\nEllison was hunched in on herself as she walked into the courtroom, wearing a dusty rose dress with a gray blazer over it, looking less like an executive than like a girl who\u2019s borrowed her boyfriend\u2019s coat because she\u2019s cold. When the prosecution asked her to identify Bankman-Fried, she had trouble finding him and gazed around the courtroom for more than 20 seconds \u2014 apparently he was incognito with his new haircut. After she did spot him, she was asked to identify him, which she did by identifying him as wearing a suit. This got chuckles from the rest of the defense table, also all in suits.\nShe listed off the crimes she\u2019d already pleaded guilty to and added that Bankman-Fried \u201cdirected me to commit these crimes,\u201d Ellison said. (Fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, and money laundering, in case you were wondering.) \u201cWe ultimately took about $14 billion, some of which we were not able to pay back.\u201d She tilted her head down to answer the questions, then lifted her head when she\u2019d finished her answer.\nBankman-Fried called this being \u201crisk-neutral,\u201d which seems like a fancy way of saying he was a gambling addict\nIn Ellison\u2019s telling, Alameda was troubled from her earliest time there in 2018. \u201cShortly after I started, I learned the company was in worse shape than I realized,\u201d Ellison said. Alameda had initially been funded with loans \u201cfrom acquaintances,\u201d she said, and those loans were recalled a few weeks after she arrived. (There was a staff revolt within Alameda Research over lost millions and general financial chaos, according to Michael Lewis\u2019 Going Infinite.) Ellison asked Bankman-Fried why he hadn\u2019t shared the company\u2019s shaky circumstances in the job offer. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t known how to tell me,\u201d she said.\nEllison was also, of course, in a more personal relationship with Bankman-Fried. (A juror who\u2019d been asleep for a discussion of the FTT token woke up when she started discussing it.) The two started sleeping together in the fall of 2018, on and off. At the time, she was a trader and Bankman-Fried was the CEO. They didn\u2019t date until later \u2014 twice. Their first relationship stretched from the summer of 2020 through the summer of 2021; they agreed to keep it secret. (Some people found out, as they usually do.) The second time, from the fall of 2021 until the spring of 2022, they lived together.\nThat gave Ellison an unusual view of his character. \u201cHe was very ambitious,\u201d she said. Besides telling her about his presidential chances, he also told her that if there was a coin flip where tails destroyed the world and heads made the world twice as good, he\u2019d flip the coin. He called this being \u201crisk-neutral,\u201d which seems like a fancy way of saying he was a gambling addict.\nShe was named co-CEO of Alameda with Sam Trabucco in 2021, while she and Bankman-Fried were broken up, and CEO in 2022. The goal, Bankman-Fried told her, was to \u201coptically\u201d separate Alameda Research and FTX. \u201cThe whole time we were dating, he was my boss at work,\u201d she said. They broke up because she wanted more from the relationship; Bankman-Fried was distant and not paying enough attention to her.\nUsing the effectively unlimited funds \u201callowed us to make profitable trades we couldn\u2019t have made otherwise\u201d\nBankman-Fried didn\u2019t grant Ellison equity, even though she asked; he told her it would be too complicated. Instead, she got a $200,000 salary, even as CEO, and bonuses twice a year, which ranged from $100,000 to $20 million.\nInitially, Alameda and FTX were \u201cvery integrated,\u201d Ellison said. They were run by the same team, from the same office. And when Alameda was scrounging for funds, Bankman-Fried told Ellison that FTX would be a good source of capital. The $65 billion line of credit Alameda Research had meant that it did not have to post collateral. There was no contract and no written terms, she testified. It also wasn\u2019t visible to FTX\u2019s auditors \u2014 she\u2019d raised the question with Bankman-Fried, and he told her not to worry about it.\nAlameda\u2019s credit line \u2014 which was taken in increments of $100,000 to $10 million at a time \u2014 was used for trading. Using the effectively unlimited funds \u201callowed us to make profitable trades we couldn\u2019t have made otherwise,\u201d Ellison testified.\nCustomer funds were also used when Bankman-Fried bought back FTX shares from Binance, an early investor, in the summer of 2021. Bankman-Fried told Ellison it was \u201creally important,\u201d otherwise \u201cBinance would do things to mess with FTX.\u201d Ellison says she told him Alameda didn\u2019t have the money. So Bankman-Fried took $1 billion of FTX customer funds to buy out Binance, the first time Ellison recalled an amount that large. It was Bankman-Fried\u2019s decision, she said, as he was the CEO of FTX.\nFTT was one of several \u201cSam coins\u201d\nThere was also the FTT token, which was created by Bankman-Fried and Wang. Alameda got its war chest \u2014 60 percent to 70 percent of the initial supply \u2014 for free, while seed investors got FTT at 10 cents a coin, and FTT first listed at $1 a coin. Bankman-Fried felt that $1 per coin was psychologically important, Ellison said, and he directed her to buy up FTT using Alameda if its price fell below a dollar.\nFTT was one of several \u201cSam coins,\u201d a nickname for tokens that Bankman-Fried was heavily involved in and owned a lot of, either personally or through Alameda. Those coins were almost certainly worth less than the value displayed on the balance sheet because trying to sell them all at once would crater the prices. Bankman-Fried directed her to put those coins on the balance sheets Alameda showed to lenders, even though she felt it was \u201csomewhat misleading.\u201d\nAlameda was also getting loans from outside lenders, such as Genesis, because when FTX started, there weren\u2019t a lot of customer funds to borrow, Ellison testified. That was the basis of the worst of her testimony \u2014 and the spreadsheet from hell.\nEllison said she\u2019d prepared the spreadsheet at Bankman-Fried\u2019s request in the fall of 2021 and shared it with him. The point was risk analysis around paying back Alameda\u2019s loans if they were abruptly recalled by Genesis, their lender. Bankman-Fried wanted to use $3 billion for venture investments, so Ellison was ballparking what that would do to Alameda\u2019s risk. In the as-is scenario, if things went south, she figured there was a 30 percent chance they wouldn\u2019t be able to meet the loan recalls. If Bankman-Fried used $3 billion to make investments, there was a 100 percent chance they couldn\u2019t meet the recalls, even with FTX customer funds.\nEchoing Bankman-Fried and Ellison\u2019s romantic relationship, FTX was keeping cozy private ties with Alameda yet publicly holding it at arm\u2019s length\nThe problem here wasn\u2019t really the math, which seemed pretty arbitrary. It was that Ellison\u2019s calculations assumed Alameda could borrow $1.8 billion in normal dollars and $1.5 billion in crypto from FTX. The spreadsheet makes this clear with a row labeled \u201cFTX borrows,\u201d which Ellison said were customer funds.\nMeanwhile, echoing Bankman-Fried and Ellison\u2019s romantic relationship, FTX was keeping cozy private ties with Alameda yet publicly holding it at arm\u2019s length. On January 14th, 2022, Bankman-Fried tweeted, \u201cWe\u2019re launching a $2b venture fund: FTX Ventures!\u201d Those funds came from Alameda, Ellison testified. But Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t want to go public with the source of the funds. He said he thought Alameda\u2019s brand was less good, and he didn\u2019t want his name associated with it. Alameda also bought Robinhood shares for Bankman-Fried, who moved them to a vehicle called \u201cEmergent Fidelity Technologies\u201d to avoid association with Alameda.\nThe day ended with a document that had been shared between Ellison and Bankman-Fried \u2014 with his comments appearing in bubbles along the main text. Ellison wrote she was worried about \u201cboth actual leverage and presenting on our balance sheet.\u201d Bankman-Fried responded with a note: \u201cYup, and could also get worse.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Elizabeth Lopatto, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-10 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":86}
{"title":"ASX set to open lower as Wall Street closes September with more losses","context":"## ASX set to open lower as Wall Street closes September with more losses\n\nTreasury Wine Estates (down 1.9 per cent) and Woolworths (down 1.2 per cent) dragged the consumer staples sector (down 1.1 per cent) lower. Pilbara Minerals (down 2.1 per cent) and Qantas (down 1.5 per cent) were also among the biggest large-cap decliners. The lowdown Stronger iron ore prices helped to bolster the local bourse on Monday but not enough to offset the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates ahead of the Reserve Bank\u2019s meeting on Tuesday. Iron ore heavyweights advanced after the iron ore price increased 1.4 per cent overnight with lithium miner Liontown resisting the downward momentum of lithium prices, which dropped to the lowest level in two years.\nMost sectors traded lower but interest-rate sensitive sectors including healthcare and consumer companies were among the weakest amid expectations that the RBA will keep rates on hold in October. The National Australia Bank has forecast another rate hike to 4.35 per cent in November. Elsewhere, Wall Street closed out its worst month and quarter of the year with more losses on Friday. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent and the majority of stocks within the index sank. The Dow Jones fell 0.5 per cent and the Nasdaq composite edged 0.1 per cent higher. The Australian sharemarket is set to retreat, with futures pointing to a fall of 38 points, or 0.5 per cent, at the open. Solid gains for stocks early on faded as pressure built from within the bond market. After easing earlier in the day on encouraging signals about inflation, Treasury yields got back to rising as the day progressed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield returned to 4.58 per cent, where it was late Thursday, after dipping to 4.52 per cent. It\u2019s again near its highest level since 2007.\nLoading Treasury bonds are seen as some of the safest investments possible, and when they pay higher yields, investors are less likely to pay high prices for stocks and other riskier investments. That\u2019s a big reason why the S&P 500 dropped 4.9 per cent in September to drag what had been a big gain for the year down to 11.7 per cent. Treasury yields have been climbing sharply as Wall Street accepts a new normal where the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates high for longer. The Fed is trying to push still-high inflation down to its target, and its main tool of high interest rates does that by trying to slow the economy and hurting prices for investments. The Fed\u2019s main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001, and the central bank indicated last week it may cut interest rates next year by less than it earlier expected. Friday\u2019s economic data shows that not only was inflation a touch cooler than expected in August, so was growth in spending by US consumers. That can be a positive for inflation because it means not as many dollars are pouring into purchases. That in turn could give companies less encouragement to try to raise prices further. But it may also dent what\u2019s been a big driver keeping the US economy out of a recession.\n\u201cIt came to a boil during a hot summer, and the temperature is really starting to come down,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, of spending growth by US consumers. \u201cHigher energy prices, student loan debt repayments and real disposable incomes that have been on a declining trajectory since June doesn\u2019t bode well.\u201d Oil prices have jumped to their highest level in more than a year, which is pressuring the economy by raising fuel costs for everyone. A barrel of US crude sank 92\u00a2 Friday to settle at $US90.79, but it\u2019s still up sharply from $US70 in June. Brent crude, the international standard, also weakened. The resumption of US student-loan repayments, meanwhile, may funnel more dollars away from the spending by consumers that has helped to keep the economy afloat. The latest monthly update on the US jobs market is due next week, with a couple of important reports on inflation coming the following week. Postponements of such reports could complicate things for the Fed, which has insisted it will make upcoming decisions on interest rates based on what incoming data say about the economy. The Fed\u2019s next meeting on rates ends on November 1. On Wall Street, Nike jumped 6.7 per cent after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Inter Miami utterly dominated the first half, but could not find the breakthrough, instead hitting the woodwork three separate times in the opening half-hour and four overall in the match. On the other end, Drake Callender was nothing short of sensational in goal, but even his heroics were just not enough to stymie the electric counter-attack that FC Cincinnati possess.\nMessi, who had missed the last four games due to injury, returned to play 35 minutes off the bench, but by the time he stepped on the pitch, Inter Miami\u2019s early dominance in the match had come and gone. Messi played a part, but he was unable to fully change the tide of the game.\nEventually, Alvaro Barreal\u2019s 78th-minute goal ended any hope that Inter Miami had to complete a stunning playoff charge, and the defeat coupled with CF Montreal\u2019s big 4-1 victory over Portland means Inter Miami are officially out of the postseason running.\nThe Sporting News followed the Inter Miami vs. FC Cincinnati match live, providing score updates, commentary and highlights as they happened.\nMORE: Inter Miami playoff scenarios before potential do-or-die match against FC Cincinnati\nInter Miami vs FC Cincinnati final score\nScore Goal scorers Inter Miami 0 \u2013 FC Cincinnati 1 Barreal (78')\nKickoff: 7:39 p.m. ET \/ 4:39 p.m. PT\nLocation: DRV PNK Stadium (Ft.

It's just outside the penalty area from a central position, and Messi stands over it yet again.\nHis effort on goal is close to finding the top-left corner, but it's just high, clipping off the very top of the crossbar. Officially the fourth time they've hit the woodwork, although this one wasn't quite as dramatic.\n89th min: Lionel Messi draws a very contentious foul by Yuya Kubo whose tackle from behind looked clean but draws a whistle regardless. Messi's delivery from a deep central position is floated in and headed out by Matt Miazga for a corner.\nThe ensuing set-piece is played short and eventually comes to Messi whose deep delivery is seeking the far corner but nervously tapped wide by Roman Celentano. Eventually, a foul by Messi ends the chance and leaves Santiago Arias rolling around on the ground.\n88th min: Two more changes for FC Cincinnati as Dominique Badji enters for Luciano Acosta, whose night is done a few minutes early despite trailing by a goal in the Golden Boot race. Malik Pinto also comes on for Brandon Vazquez.\nTeammates Acosta and Aaron Boupendza are jawing at each other as the change is made, which might be an alarming sign for FC Cincinnati with the playoffs on the horizon.\n84th min: Roman Celentano absorbs a yellow card for time wasting as he stands over a goal kick, much to the delight of the home crowd.\n79th min: GOAL! FC CINCINNATI! Drake Callender makes another sensational save, but this time he can't keep Inter Miami level! Callender parries Yuya Kubo's initial effort, but he drives it right into the path of Alvaro Barreal, and he buries the follow-up low into the far corner, and now Inter Miami are in very hot water!\nCF Montreal are leading the Portland Timbers 3-0, and therefore Inter Miami must win or they are officially OUT of the playoff race!\n\u00c1lvaro Barreal off the rebound to give @fccincinnati the lead late against Inter Miami. pic.twitter.com\/DpZEQ2O01H \u2014 Major League Soccer (@MLS) October 8, 2023\n76th min: Two more changes for Inter Miami, as Josef Martinez is curiously withdrawn, replaced by Nick Stefanelli. Robert Taylor also enters for DeAndre Yedlin. They have to win to stay alive in the MLS playoff race.\n67th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! ANOTHER BONKERS SAVE BY DRAKE CALLENDER! HE'S UNBEATABLE TONIGHT! Aaron Boupendza crosses to Brandon Vazquez on the counter, and while the latter is clean through on goal, Callender comes across his goal to make a sensational stop!\nThe flag goes up, meaning it won't count as a save, but the replay looked incredibly close, so Callender's stop means that VAR does not have a chance to intervene.\n65th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! Inter Miami have hit the post three times, but now it's FC Cincinnati who have struck the woodwork! Brandon Vazquez gets his head to a corner but it comes off the post.\n64th min: Inter Miami have to remain wary of the vicious FC Cincinnati counter-attack, and here a lovely Luciano Acosta switch laterally across the top of the penalty area finds Alvaro Barreal in space, but his hit is blocked.\nPat Noonan makes his second change of the match, bringing Yuya Kubo on for Junior Moreno in midfield.\n58th min: Lionel Messi's influence has been immediate, and he earns a dangerous free-kick just outside the penalty area, well within his range. Messi appears to be struggling to get good footing on this field, but it's the shirt pull from Miazga which brings him down.\nMessi takes it but puts it way over the crossbar. A bit rusty?\n57th min: Jean Mota has a shot from distance, and it looks to be a vicious knuckler with some dip, but it goes just wide.\n55th min: HERE COMES LIONEL MESSI! He will enter with around 35 minutes to save Inter Miami's season, replacing Tomas Aviles in a very attacking change. Jean Mota also comes on to replace David Ruiz, which is harsh as the young midfielder had been very good.\n50th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! DRAKE CALLENDER MAKES A MASSIVE DOUBLE SAVE! FC Cincinnati are RIGHT on the doorstep, but he comes up huge twice! Aaron Boupendza is the most aggrieved, as his follow-up came from directly in front of the goal but he was stymied by Callender's outstretched right foot!\n47th min: Luciano Acosta is fouled on the edge of the attacking third, and it gives FC Cincinnati a free-kick early in the second half. Alvaro Barreal's delivery is floated way high in the air and falls to the far post, but after a nervy moment it's cleared.\nLionel Messi begins to warm up on the touchline, and he may be brought on soon to help Inter Miami save their postseason chances.\nKickoff: The second half is underway, and there are no changes from Inter Miami, which means Lionel Messi remains on the bench for now. With their playoff hopes now squarely on the line, it's a huge call from Gerardo Martino not to bring Messi on now, and it could speak to how fit he truly is.\nFC Cincinnati make one change, as Sergio Santos comes off, replaced by Aaron Boupendza up front.\nHALFTIME: Inter Miami 0-0 FC Cincinnati\nNeeding victory in this match to ensure they remain in the MLS playoff picture, Inter Miami completely dominated the confirmed 2023 regular season champs but somehow did not manage to capitalize on their overwhelming pressure. Inter Miami were so unlucky not to cash in on multiple occasions, hitting the woodwork an insane three times, all in the first 30 minutes. Lionel Messi may yet have a job to do tonight, currently available off the bench.\nFC Cincinnati had one really good look that they missed as well but otherwise were on their heels the entire 45 minutes. Head coach Pat Noonan tells the broadcast he feels FC Cincinnati had \"a lack of courage on the ball\" that half, \"as bad as its been all year.\"\nElsewhere, Inter Miami will be nervous about other results from around the league. Most painful is the 2-0 lead for CF Montreal over Portland, which would be a big blow to Inter Miami, meaning they would be eliminated with anything less than a win tonight.\nInter Miami vs FC Cincinnati: First Half\n43rd min: There's a goal mouth scrap that sees Roman Celentano scrambling wildly on the doorstep as the ball bounces around awkwardly, but nobody can get on the end of it for Inter Miami.\n38th min: While Inter Miami haven't generated any clear-cut chances since the Celentano save on the half-hour mark, they've remained in complete control of this match. The broadcast shows Lionel Messi on the bench, and he looks very antsy, like he wants to enter the game badly.\nSome Inter Miami players are called off the touchline to warm up, but Messi isn't one of them.\n30th min: Chance, Inter Miami! Facundo Farias forces Roman Celentano into a full-stretch save! A right-footed blast sees the FC Cincinnati goalkeeper make his first big stop. It's an utter siege from Inter Miami through the opening half-hour! Supporters' Shield winners FC Cincinnati have barely survived thus far!\n28th min: Obinna Nwobodo is booked for a very late tackle on Facundo Farias in transition. He has to watch himself, as he gives the referee a sarcastic applause, which is a good way to draw the official's ire and get sent off.\n26th min: Inter Miami have another good set-piece opportunity as the rain begins to fall hard at Inter Miami. It's really coming down in South Florida, and more could be on the way. Sergio Busquets takes it and blasts it straight into the wall.\nInter Miami fans chant \"Mess, Messi\" as they have a free kick! pic.twitter.com\/VkyvULPUHp \u2014 Mundo Albiceleste \u2b50\ud83c\udf1f\u2b50\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 (@MundoAlbicelest) October 8, 2023\n24th min: Chance, Inter Miami! THEY'VE HIT THE WOODWORK AGAIN! Benja Cremaschi is fed through on a one-two with Josef Martinez, and with the outside of his right foot, he bends it around Matt Miazga but clatters the near post. The THIRD time Inter Miami have hit the bar in under a half-hour! How unlucky??\n22nd min: Chance, Inter Miami! Inter Miami hit the woodwork again! Josef Martinez, who has been electric so far, rips a shot from a tight angle about 15 yards out, and while it beats Roman Celentano, it also clatters the far post and deflects out! So close again for the hosts!\n22' | Josef takes a chance and it hits the post\ud83e\udd2f#MIAvCIN | 0-0 pic.twitter.com\/BbD0dWKnzP \u2014 Inter Miami CF (@InterMiamiCF) October 8, 2023\n20th min: Josef Martinez's hold-up play creates a chance for a charging Benja Cremaschi, but he puts his driven effort wide.\n14th min: Inter Miami have a very dangerous free-kick as Josef Martinez is bundled over from behind by Junior Moreno. The ball is shaded right of the middle just inches outside the penalty area, and it'll be Facundo Farias to take with his fellow Argentine Lionel Messi on the bench. The floated delivery find the head of a teammate, but the shot is weak and easily caught by Roman Celentano.\n12th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! WHAT A SAVE DRAKE CALLENDER! Cincinnati hit on the counter again, as Brandon Vazquez brilliantly settles a ball from deep and finds Sergio Santos. The Cincinnati forward is tackled by Tomas Aviles as he gets his shot off, and that may have put him off just enough to allow Callender to make a diving, full-stretch stop.\nEnd-to-end stuff so far!\n9th min: Chance, Inter Miami! Oh no, Tomas Aviles has missed with the goal gaping! On a corner, the initial header drops in Aviles's lap, and he produces a finish of real quality, whipping his leg horizontally at the bouncing ball up near his hip, but he crashes the shot off the crossbar! It had serious pace and should have bulged the net!\nChance, FC Cincinnati! Just seconds after Aviles hit the woodwork, FC Cincinnati counter with real venom, and Sergio Santos puts his chance wide! He's pressured while making a one-on-one run, and the delivery from the right flashes wide of the near post as he slides to meet it.\nBoth teams will believe they should be in front!\n9' | Toto creates a chance early off the crossbar \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2f#MIAvCIN | 0-0 pic.twitter.com\/aogoOmlhCU \u2014 Inter Miami CF (@InterMiamiCF) October 7, 2023\n8th min: Inter Miami have held the attacking possession in the opening stage of the match, looking to break down FC Cincinnati early, but Matt Miazga holds firm before he's fouled as Josef Martinez undercuts him in the air.\n3rd min: An early free-kick for Inter Miami from about 35 yards away shaded way right, and with Lionel Messi on the bench, Noah Allen stands over the ball. The play is off the training ground, as his delivery goes vertically to try and create a lateral cross opportunity for DeAndre Yedlin, but it's overcooked and completely wasted over the end line. Yikes.\nKickoff: The match is under way at DRV PNK Stadium! One club's status for the postseason is as assured as possible, while the other team's status is far from certain.\nInter Miami vs FC Cincinnati: Pre-match commentary, analysis, stats, and more\n5 mins to kickoff: While there is no active protest happening from the Inter Miami supporter section, they are also taking more muted measures to make their feelings known. They have made a collective effort not to be their usual cheerful selves before kickoff, sitting quietly instead of waving flags and making noise.\nWith such a massive game on hand, this is a very clear sign of frustration with the enormous increase in ticket prices next season. Inter Miami's home field advantage tonight will be significantly hampered.\nNot sure how much can be appreciated via the photo, but La Familia \u2014 Inter Miami\u2019s supporters\u2019 groups \u2014 are mostly sitting here before kickoff.\n\nNo drums, chanting, or enthusiasm in what is a protest to the increased price of season tickets for 2024.#InterMiamiCF #Messi\ud80c\udcf5 pic.twitter.com\/YaP4ivlX0P \u2014 Franco Panizo (@FrancoPanizo) October 7, 2023\n15 mins to kickoff: Interestingly, while tonight's match should kick off without any negative attention, it seems the club just managed to get off the ground without a hitch. According to Michelle Kaufman of the Miami Herald, the supporter groups had planned a protest regarding 2024 season ticket prices, but the club offered to meet with them this coming week so they called it off until that can take place.\nA reminder, this match officially kicks off at 7:39 p.m. ET so there will be a slight delay from the advertised 7:30 p.m. time.\nInter Miami fan news: the 5 supporters\u2019 groups known as La Familia threatened to stage a protest this game re: ticket price hike for 2024, but team offered to meet w\/them next week, so protest off at least until next game. @MiamiHerald @HeraldSports @InterMiamiCF #InterMiamiCF \u2014 Michelle Kaufman (@kaufsports) October 7, 2023\n30 mins to kickoff: Lionel Messi's availability for Inter Miami is a welcome sight for the club, as they take the field today with their backs against the wall. Inter Miami must win tonight to ensure they remain alive in the playoff race. A draw or a loss, however, would see them vulnerable to outside results.\nIf Inter Miami do not win, two of the following three possible outcomes would trigger their elimination from playoff contention: CF Montreal beats Portland Timbers; NYCFC wins versus D.C. United; and Chicago Fire picks up points against Charlotte FC.\nThose are all conceivable results, and therefore Inter Miami will wish to keep it in their own hands just a little longer. They'll eventually need other results to go their way to climb the table, but for now, their survival is solely up to them.\n45 mins to kickoff: Lineups are in, and Lionel Messi is on the bench for Inter Miami.\nFor FC Cincinnati, Luciano Acosta starts despite the match being meaningless from a tangible standpoint, understandable considering he is chasing the Golden Boot. Ian Murphy comes in for Yerson Mosquera at the back, while Aaron Boupendza is rotated out up front with Brandon Vazquez and Sergio Santos starting together up front.\n1 hour to kickoff: With lineups still yet to be released, let's take a look at one player who is, in fact, an MVP candidate for this year.\nFC Cincinnati forward Luciano Acosta is one back of Denis Bouanga for the MLS goal scoring lead with two matches left, sitting on 16 for the year. With 13 assists alongside that, his 29 total goal contributions are best in the league, above the 27 of Thiago Almada and 25 of Hany Mukhtar. Acosta ranks as the second-highest rated player by WhoScored this season across all of Major League Soccer.\nYou wonder if he's going to be rested tonight with the Supporters' Shield and No. 1 seed locked up. It would be devastating for him to be injured in a meaningless game, regardless of the opponent.\n\"Luciano Acosta's the MVP... He's been an unbelievable player for us this year.\" @fccincinnati goalkeeper @roman_413 had nothing but praise for @LuchoAcosta94 and Pat Noonan \ud83d\udfe0\ud83d\udd35 pic.twitter.com\/Xyp2ozr7n5 \u2014 CBS Sports Golazo \u26bd\ufe0f (@CBSSportsGolazo) October 3, 2023\n1 hour 15 mins to kick: Lionel Messi was nominated for not only MLS Newcomer of the Year for the 2023 season, but also 2023 MLS MVP.\nLaughable doesn't even begin to describe that blatant PR move, considering that most of the damage Messi has done for Inter Miami has come in Cup competitions. He has one goal and two assists in 247 minutes of play in actual MLS competition. Lionel Messi has been fun, but let's hope the league doesn't make a mockery of itself by actually giving Messi either honor.\n1 hour 30 mins to kick: As if Inter Miami's predicament tonight wasn't difficult enough, requiring a victory to keep their playoff hopes alive, it will have to come against the best team in Major League Soccer through the 2023 regular season.\nFC Cincinnati won the Supporters' Shield as the regular season champion, confirmed on Wednesday despite suffering defeat. It's been an exceptional season for the club, and they won't stop here just because they have nothing tangible left to gain over the final few matches.\nCampeones!!! \ud83c\udfc6\u26bd\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc6 2023 supporters\u2019 shield winners \ud83d\udfe0\ud83d\udd35 pic.twitter.com\/96ckfHkKEp \u2014 Santiago Arias (@santiagoarias13) October 7, 2023\n1 hour 45 mins to kick: It's Fan Appreciation Night at DRV PNK Stadium, where they're giving out Inter Miami bucket hats to the first few fans through the gates.\nThat's nice and all, but the best way to appreciate the fans would be to not price out the loyal supporters from season tickets next year. Instead, Inter Miami has jacked 2024 membership rates to put the club amongst some of the most expensive tickets in not just MLS, but the world.\nWhile there will certainly be folks who can afford those high-demand tickets, many of those individuals won't be the same fans who have supported the club from its inception in 2020. This means Inter Miami have chosen to secure maximum profit at the expense of its fanbase, and a high turnover amongst the regular in-person support from this season to next is likely.\nMORE: Inter Miami season tickets for 2024 season see unprecedented jump in price\n(Also, you'll notice a photo of Lionel Messi's jersey hanging in his locker in that tweet below, a pretty good indication that he'll return tonight)\nScene is set for Fan Appreciation Night \ud83c\udfdf\ufe0f#MIAvCIN | 7:30 PM ET pic.twitter.com\/9I07uq9hGW \u2014 Inter Miami CF (@InterMiamiCF) October 7, 2023\n2 hours to kickoff: A report from well-connected Argentine journalist Gaston Edul last night indicated that Inter Miami are likely to have Lionel Messi back for this match in some capacity.

{"title":"From Ten Hag\u2019s future to a leaking roof: Ratcliffe\u2019s Manchester United in-tray","context":"## From Ten Hag\u2019s future to a leaking roof: Ratcliffe\u2019s Manchester United in-tray\n\nThe manager\u2019s future\nErik ten Hag\u2019s team are treading water at precisely the wrong moment: as Sir Jim Ratcliffe takes charge of Manchester United\u2019s sporting department before making sweeping changes in the posts that will directly affect the manager. Richard Arnold has left despite officially staying until the end of the year and into his role may come Jean-Claude Blanc, the CEO of Ratcliffe\u2019s Ineos Sport, as the man Ten Hag reports to. Ten Hag\u2019s line manager may change too, as Ratcliffe considers whether a new football director is required, a position held by John Murtough. Ten Hag may have a first clue of his status in Ratcliffe\u2019s new empire if he is sounded out for his view of a prime factor in his ability to coach and manage the side to success: United\u2019s transfer policy. This leads us to Murtough \u2026\nWill Murtough survive?\nThe football director has no plans to depart but whether he remains in situ may be a matter for Ratcliffe. Some inside the club believe Murtough will either be moved sideways or follow Arnold through the exit door. Ratcliffe might have signalled his assessment of him when, during a March tour of the club, he questioned the signing of a 30-year-old Casemiro on a four\u2011year deal worth about \u00a3350,000 a week. Murtough, whose football department has a transfer veto, and Ten Hag, who has the same, were responsible for the Brazilian\u2019s signing. The word is that Murtough, present when Ratcliffe raised this, was hardly impressed. Particularly as Nice, the French club owned by Ratcliffe, recruited Aaron Ramsey, Kasper Schmeichel and Ross Barkley as part of the nine signings in the same summer Casemiro joined United. Schmeichel was 35 and signed a three-year contract in a \u00a31m transfer from Leicester; Ramsey, then 31, and Barkley, then 28, came on frees and were given one-year deals. All three players left Nice this summer. Newcastle\u2019s sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and Paul Mitchell, Monaco\u2019s sporting director until March, are among those mentioned in dispatches as a potential Murtough replacement.\nCan any CEO make United a best-in-class elite club again?\nBlanc, who has an MBA from Harvard, is billed as the \u201cLionel Messi of business\u201d by Nice\u2019s chief executive, Fabrice Bocquet. At 60 years old Blanc has been the Juventus CEO and president, CEO at Paris Saint\u2011Germain and French Tennis, and the executive overseeing the Tour de France. But once he or whoever becomes Arnold\u2019s successor is in place, it will dawn rapidly that United are a one-off hydra-headed beast of a club which is treacherously difficult to control. And there is this, too: across town Manchester City have accrued six championships since United\u2019s last in 2013 and boast a commercial operation that leaves Ratcliffe\u2019s new concern light years behind.\nOld Trafford (and the training ground)\nTo find an apt shorthand for the lurching ship that is United, end the search at the roof of their stadium where on Manchester\u2019s (many) wet days rain leaks through. Old Trafford remains a storied venue but as it continues to crumble the tale of disrepair has become a central narrative in its recent history. As Premier League titles have become scarce (zero in a decade) the tale of neglect of a ground that dates to 1910 is emblematic of the Glazers\u2019 quasi\u2011absentee proprietorship. Ratcliffe will invest $300m (\u00a3237m) into infrastructure but this is small beer when considering the multibillion-pound facelift or new venue required. There is also the cramped Carrington base: as on Sir Matt Busby Way, the footprint is large at the training ground but the configuration and facilities are ageing \u2013 badly.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Greig Cowie\/Shutterstock\nCommunications\nThe Glazers treat a microphone or TV camera as United fans do Liverpool or Manchester City: as a fierce enemy. No family member has given a press conference or interview during their 18-year tenure. Ratcliffe has arrived on a ticket of, partly, being the local lad made good (Failsworth, where he was born, is next to Newton Heath, United\u2019s birthplace) so if he proves as silent as the Americans then this will be: a) poor PR; and b) just plain poor. Football fans can be classed as the most loyal citizens of any society but even the faith of United enthusiasts has been stretched by the cold relationship created by the Glazers\u2019 stance regarding communication. A tap-in, then, for Ratcliffe is to remedy this by opening and maintaining a regular line into supporters.\nThe Glazer family have little relationship with the Manchester United fans \u2013 something Ratcliffe would do well to avoid. Photograph: Michael Regan\/Getty Images\nEnsuring a working relationship with the Glazers\nFor paying an overpriced \u00a31.3bn for his 25% Ratcliffe obtains a major element of control but still the Glazers remain majority owners. The 71-year-old oversees football policy but these do not exist in a vacuum given that the commercial side affects this and vice versa. Ratcliffe accepts Manchester United have an impressive revenue-based model that makes the club akin to a cash machine but he is not enamoured of how the money generated is invested \u2013 primarily in the squad. What happens then, for example, if Ten Hag wants a new midfield ace, Ratcliffe agrees but the Glazers cite a downturn in income and thus seek to block the signing?\n\nThis article, authored by Jamie Jackson, was published by The Guardian on 2023-12-25 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":89}

{"title":"The best Apple Cyber Monday deals of 2023: Save on AirPods, iPads, Apple Watches and more","context":"## The best Apple Cyber Monday deals of 2023: Save on AirPods, iPads, Apple Watches and more\n\nEngadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThere are still a handful more hours of Cyber Monday, so if you're searching for deals on Apple devices, you're in luck. Many of these deals started well before Black Friday, and all but a few are still live. Whether you need an iPad for couchside entertainment, or even productivity, or a new pair of AirPods Pro for a gift, this is a great time to shop. Surprisingly, Apple's latest products like the M3 MacBook Pro and the Apple Watch Series 9 are included in the discounts. If something catches your eye, you may want to click \"add to cart,\" as we expect many of these deals to expire before tomorrow hits. These are the best Cyber Monday Apple deals for 2023.\nAirPod Cyber Monday deals\nAirPods Pro (2nd gen, USB-C)\nWhen Apple announced the new iPhone 15 and its conversion to USB-C charging, the company also revealed the second generation AirPods Pro with the same connector. That version has dropped to $190 at Amazon and Target. They\u2019ve gone or as low as $189 recently, so this is within a dollar of that price. Other than the port, the hardware hasn\u2019t changed so you\u2019re still getting the earbuds we named the best pick for iPhone users in our guide. In addition to pairing well with Apple\u2019s handsets, the buds also offer one of the best transparency modes on the market along with solid ANC and richer fuller sound than the previous generation Pros. The Lightning version is on sale for $169 at Walmart.\nRead our full review of the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)\nAirPods Max\nThe over-ear AirPods Max are normally far too expensive for us to recommend. But now they're down to $450, which is a new low price and $30 cheaper than Prime Day in October. You can get the deal at Amazon or Best Buy. They're $519 at B&H Photo. They are well-designed, comfortable, and implement all of the helpful Siri integrations. We also like the great noise cancellation and Spatial Audio. While they\u2019re a little heavy, the fit is still comfortable and the on-device controls, while unique, are simple and \u201ca joy to use.\u201d\nHere's our full review of the AirPods Max.\nAirPods (3rd gen)\nThe third generation AirPods with the Lightning charging case are down to $140 at Amazon and Target. They carry a list price of $169 but often sell for closer to $150, so this is $10 off the usual. These non-Pro AirPods came out in 2021 and got a review score of 88 from us. They pair quickly with iPhones and are a good complement to Siri\u2019s helpfulness. They don\u2019t have ANC however \u2014 you\u2019ll need to go for the AirPods Pro for that feature \u2014 but they do have Adaptive EQ which monitors and adapts sound in real time. The fit is comfortable and they\u2019re water-resistant so they can handle workouts or the weather.\nApple Watch Cyber Monday deals\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is now $739, which is $60 off. It sold for $9 less during Black Friday and is one of the few Apple products to not maintain its pricing for Cyber Monday. Both Amazon and Best Buy are selling it for $739. The Ultra 2 has the same new chip as the Apple Watch Series 9 so it can perform the new Double Tap trick, but also sports a more robust build and outdoor-specific features that make it suited to adventurers. There\u2019s a siren to alert people to your presence as well as a dive meter, waypoint setting capabilities and night mode to preserve your low-light vision. It's our recommended Apple Watch for adventurers.\nCheck out our guide to the best Apple Watches for 2023\nApple Watch SE\nThe most affordable smartwatch in the lineup is the Apple Watch SE, which is now down to $179. It has a list price of $249 but has regularly sold for $220 lately so this is still a significant deal. We called it the best smartwatch money can buy in our review when it came out in 2022. It lacks an always-on display and a few of the more specialized health sensors, like the blood oxygen app, but the fitness features and tracking data are well-rounded, plus the notifications and integrations are particularly convenient for iPhone users.\nApple Watch Series 9\nThe new Apple Watch Series 9 is seeing a $70 discount that brings it to $330 at Amazon, Target and Walmart. That's a new low for the wearable that debuted alongside the iPhone 15 back in September. The big change this time around is a new SiP (system in package) chip that allows for a Double Tap feature that lets you tap your thumb and forefinger together to answer calls and more. It also allows for the onboard processing of Siri requests, making simple demands (like starting a timer or a workout) happen faster.\nThe Series 9 has an always-on display and when paired with the Sport Loop is a carbon neutral product. As has been the case for many years now, the Apple Watch is an excellent fitness companion, offering comprehensive health and activity data. It also happens to be our favorite smartwatch for most people.\nRead our full review of the Apple Watch Series 9\nApple iPad Cyber Monday deals\niPad (10th generation)\nThe tenth generation iPad is on sale for $349 at Amazon, Best Buy and Target, which is $100 off the list price. It has often sold for $399 lately so this is still $50 off the typical street price. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wild improvement over the previous generation, though it does orient the camera to the landscape edge, which is much better for video calling. The USB-C charging is more modern than the Lightning connector on the 9th gen iPad, but for some reason this model still works with the first generation Apple Pencil (even though the slate came out after the second-gen stylus).\niPad Air\nThe base model of the latest generation of the iPad Air has an MSRP of $599 and is now down to $499, a price its hit quite a few times in 2023. This is the iPad we recommend for most people because it\u2019s speedy, has a great screen and works with current-generation accessories. It can act as a rather powerful entertainment option for games and streaming, but is powerful enough to serve as a productivity device when paired up with a stylus or mouse and a keyboard. Now that the M3 chip has been loosed upon the world, the iPad Air, which houses the M1 chip, is primed for an update, which will likely come next year (along with a potential price increase).\niPad mini\nFor a more portable iPad experience, the iPad mini offers a bigger screen than your phone, but is barely as easy to carry around with you. It\u2019s listed at $499, but has dropped as low as $400 many times this year. Now it\u2019s back down to that low at Amazon, Target and Best Buy. The smaller iPad got a refresh last year, adding a new Liquid Retina screen, a Touch-ID top button instead of a Home button, and a USB-C charging. The performance is snappy and the integration with the second-generation Apple Pencil makes it excel as a digital notebook. As we said in our review, with the mini, Apple \u201cquashes notion that \u2018smaller\u2019 means \u2018lesser.\u2019\u201d\nApple iPad (9th generation)\nFor a few hours during the Black Friday sales, the 9th generation iPad went as low as $229 at Amazon. That deal appears to have sold out, but if you still want the prior generation standard Apple slate, it's now $80 off the MSRP from Walmart. That's about the same as it's sold for these past few months. But we still think it's a good buy and recommend it as the best budget iPad you can buy.\nCheck out our guide to iPads here.\nMacBook Cyber Monday deals\nMacBook Pro (14-inch, 2023, M3)\nThe base model, 14-inch MacBook Pro with the new M3 chip just came out in October but is $150 off for Cyber Monday. After testing the new chip, we think the base model with 8GB of RAM may quickly get bogged down. If it's within your budget, we recommend the model with 16GB of RAM, which is $150 off at B&H photo. And if you upgrade to a model with the M3 Pro chip for an even speedier experience \u2014 you'll get a $200 discount as it's down to $2,199 at B&H Photo. We gave the new M3 MacBook Pros an appreciative review and named them the best option for creatives in our buyer\u2019s guide.\nRead our review of the new MacBook Pros with the M3 chip\nMacBook Air (15-inch, 2023, M2)\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air arrived in June and added a little more screen real estate to an already great machine. It\u2019s down to $1,049 for Cyber Monday at Amazon and Best Buy. That\u2019s the same as the all-time low it\u2019s hit a few times these past couple of months. In addition, it's $200 off at B&H Photo. We gave it a 96 in our review and liked how the bigger screen let you get the most out of the M2 processor.\nNow that the M3 MacBook Pros have arrived, we\u2019re guessing Apple will come out with M3-enabled Air models in 2024. Still the M2 has plenty of processing power and will serve you well as both a casual machine for playing games and watching shows, but can also hold its own with productivity tasks.\nMacBook Air (13-inch, 2022, M2)\nThe M2-powered, 13-inch MacBook Air is on sale for $929 at B&H Photo. It\u2019s our top recommendation for a MacBook and beat out all brands in our laptop guide. The M2 chip is impressively fast and capable, the design is solid and the display is lovely. It\u2019s more than capable for both work and play and should give you years of dependable use. But, again, the M3-enabled Airs are likely on their way in 2024. So if you know you\u2019re drawn to the newest thing, you might want to wait.\nMacBook Air (13-inch, 2020, M1)\nThe MacBook Air with the M1 chip is a couple years old at this point, but still officially part of Apple\u2019s laptop lineup. It dropped to an all-time low of $750 for October\u2019s Prime Day at Amazon and now Amazon and Best Buy are selling it for the same price. It\u2019s the budget pick in our guide to MacBooks and the top pick in our guide to budget laptops. Check out our review from when it first came out in which we praised its quick speeds, excellent screen and good battery life.\nCyber Monday deals on Apple accessories\n$100 Apple Gift Card + $15 Amazon credit\nIf you purchase an Apple gift card totaling $100 or more from the retailer, you can get $15 in Amazon store credit for no extra cost. Just use the code APPLET5USA at checkout to see the offer. The deal applies to the digital version of the card; as of this writing, you can get the credit with a physical Apple gift card as well by using the code APPLET5USAP, though you may not want to clip the coupon on those cards' product page, as Amazon's listing says that will only give you a $10 credit. As a reminder, you can use an Apple gift card for App Store credit, subscription services like Apple Music or iCloud, and\/or purchases made at a physical Apple store.\nApple AirTags\nA four-pack of Apple AirTags is $80 right now at Amazon, thanks to a 19 percent discount. They go for $29 each at full price, so the deal will save you $9 a pop. AirTags are our top picks for Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users as they tap into Apple\u2019s disturbingly vast FindMy network, using other Apple mobiles to find your lost stuff. If you want just a single AirTag, you can grab one for $24 (a $5 discount) at Walmart and Target.\nApple Pencil\nApple now makes three different Apple Pencils. The original recharges via Lightning. The second generation recharges wirelessly and the new USB-C looks a lot like the first generation, but charges via USB-C instead of lighting. Each one has different iPad compatibility with iPads. While that part is confusing, the pencil itself is rather elegant and one of the best accessories for your iPad. The 2nd generation stylus is down to $80 right now, while the USB-C model is down to $71 at Amazon.\nApple TV 4K\nThe Apple TV 4K is our favorite premium streaming device and is currently $125 at B&H Photo. That's not a huge discount, but the streaming box rarely goes on sale. We gave it a 94 in our review because it\u2019s fast, has an excellent Siri remote and integrates seamlessly with Apple\u2019s overall ecosystem. Navigation is clean and easy to use, plus the device can stream in 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision.\nMac Mini M2\nThe base model of Apple diminutive desktop computer, the Mac mini, is currently on sale for $100 off for Cyber Monday at Amazon, B&H Photo, Best Buy. It earned an 86 in our review because it packs a lot of processing power, using the same M2 chip as the two current-model MacBook Airs \u2014 but it\u2019s much cheaper than either laptop. If you need a little more storage, you can get it with 512GB of SSD for $699 at B&H Photo.\nYour Cyber Monday Shopping Guide: See all of Yahoo\u2019s Cyber Monday coverage, here.

{"title":"Everton players and fans will be fired up by points penalty, asserts Sean Dyche","context":"## Everton players and fans will be fired up by points penalty, asserts Sean Dyche\n\nSean Dyche is confident Everton\u2019s season will not be derailed by their 10-point penalty for breaching Premier League financial rules but has warned his players that they cannot rely on the club\u2019s appeal to rescue them from another relegation battle.\nThe Everton manager said he was shocked and aggrieved by an independent commission\u2019s decision to impose the biggest sporting sanction in Premier League history for a \u00a319.5m overspend in 2021-22. Dyche was ill while on holiday in Dubai when informed of the punishment by Everton\u2019s director of football, Kevin Thelwell. He described the deduction as both disproportionate and unjust.\nDyche addressed the first-team squad at Everton\u2019s Finch Farm training ground on Friday morning, once they had all returned from international duty. Players reacted to last Friday\u2019s news by sharing defiant messages on their WhatsApp group. After a run of six wins in nine games in all competitions, that had lifted Everton to 14th in the table prior to being plunged back to 19th, their resolve to maintain momentum and haul the club out of danger was relayed to the manager at Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\u201cThe feeling was very positive in the sense of building on the mentality that\u2019s been there lately,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cWe all spoke about that, saying this hasn\u2019t changed it and it\u2019s building regardless of this current situation. The players are clear-minded. They have their WhatsApp group and when the news broke they put it straight on there: \u2018Right lads, just another challenge, this is how we take it on\u2019. The group is taking ownership and that\u2019s a powerful thing.\n\u201cI got from them the sense that: \u2018What we\u2019re building, we don\u2019t let anything disrupt that and we don\u2019t let anything get in the way\u2019. You can\u2019t guarantee it\u2019s made a difference [to players\u2019 resolve] yet because we haven\u2019t played any games. All I know is that the players know what we\u2019re doing. They\u2019ve referenced that to me probably for the last six weeks.\u201d\nEverton\u2019s appeal against the 10-point deduction will be heard by a different three-person panel before the end of the season. Dyche, however, wants his team to forget about the appeal and accept the reality of being joint-bottom of the Premier League on four points. That outlook, he believes, will help Everton focus on hauling themselves out of the relegation zone.\nAbdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 celebrates Everton\u2019s win at Crystal Palace, the club\u2019s sixth victory in nine games. Photograph: Jacques Feeney\/Offside\/Getty Images\nOn the prospect of survival, Dyche said: \u201cI\u2019ve never lacked confidence in my own ability, in my staff\u2019s ability or the players\u2019 ability. I\u2019ve never lacked confidence since I\u2019ve been here and, let\u2019s face it, I\u2019ve had some pretty tough times. But it\u2019s not just about confidence. You\u2019ve got to win games, and this is just another big challenge.\n\u201cIt is currently a momentary thing because we don\u2019t know what the appeal brings, we don\u2019t know how that changes things again. But until that period, and I have made it clear to the players, be under no illusions because there are no guarantees things will change so we have to commit to what\u2019s going on now as if that is the reality. It might be changed but, until it\u2019s changed, we have to commit to this reality. There are no guarantees that what goes before guarantees what comes next. We have to keep pushing like we have been doing because we have lost 10 points and we have to get them back as quick as we can.\u201d\nEverton fans have a series of protests against the Premier League planned for Sunday\u2019s home game against Manchester United, when a win could possibly lift Dyche\u2019s team out of the bottom three. After several years of division at Goodison Park, certainly in terms of the fanbase and the club\u2019s hierarchy, the punishment has created a collective siege mentality that Dyche wants his team to utilise.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I will be amazed if the Evertonians are not right on song. I\u2019ll be very surprised if they are not, knowing what I do. I don\u2019t know them yet but I am learning about Evertonians and how they commit to the club and the cause. I\u2019m getting deeper in my knowledge of that and I\u2019ll be very surprised if they are not right there with us. It doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll win but it gives you a better chance when they are right behind the players going: \u2018Come on then, let\u2019s take it on again\u2019.\n\u201cI sense that the underbelly, the fans with the depth of knowledge about Everton who remember the hard-fought years and what it has been built upon \u2013 not every Evertonian just knows moneyed years \u2013 they remember when they had to fight and work to build a team and a mentality. I think they can sense it again. That\u2019s what I think. I think they sense we are getting back to an earthiness, a determined Everton group of players who will really have a go.\u201d\nDyche declined to comment on the implications of Everton\u2019s punishment for Manchester City, who have been charged with 115 financial breaches by the Premier League, and deny any wrongdoing, and Chelsea, who are also under investigation by the football authorities.\n\nThis article, authored by Andy Hunter, was published by The Guardian on 2023-11-24 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":92}

In an explosive first half, Eintracht completely overran Bayern and exposed their error-prone backline, scoring three times in 24 minutes.\nOmar Marmoush opened their account in the 12th minute, drilling in the rebound after Fares Chaibi had hit the crossbar following a miskick from Bayern\u2019s Noussair Mazraoui. After yet more slapdash defending from Bayern, \u00c9ric Dina Ebimbe doubled their lead in the 31st minute and Hugo Larsson made it 3-0 five minutes later, benefiting from a Joshua Kimmich error. Kimmich made amends just before the break with a powerful shot from 20 yards to cut the deficit but it did not stop the home side.\nEintracht put the ball in the net again, five minutes after the restart, to make it 4-1, outplaying Bayern with another textbook quick break and with Ebimbe beating Manuel Neuer for his second goal of the afternoon. Ansgar Knauff then slotted in to make it 5-1 on the hour as Frankfurt became the first team in 48 years to score five goals in one hour against Bayern in the Bundesliga since their own 6-0 win in 1975.\nQuick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

They took the fight out of us in that first half hour. When you lose 5-1 then a reaction has to follow. We won\u2019t lose our heads now. We don\u2019t have enough time but we will bounce back.\u201d\nBayern, who have a game in hand after last week\u2019s game against Union Berlin was postponed due to snow, remain in second place on 32 points, with the leaders, Bayer Leverkusen, on 35, travelling to third-placed VfB Stuttgart, who have 30 points, on Sunday.\nLater, RB Leipzig beat 10-man Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to tighten their grip on fourth place and put a further dent in their opponents\u2019 title hopes.\nIt started badly for the hosts with Mats Hummels sent off for a last-man foul at the edge of the box in the 15th minute, then a Ramy Bensebaini own goal put the visitors in front just after the half-hour.\nDortmund equalised with the last kick of the first half when Niklas Suele volleyed in from the far post. But it was only a matter of time until Leipzig scored again and they did it with Christoph Baumgartner in the 54th.\nWith Dortmund taking risks in search of an equaliser, Leipzig launched a counterattack and Yussuf Poulsen rifled in before Niclas F\u00fcllkrug scored deep in stoppage time for some last-gasp drama. Leipzig are fourth on 29 points and now have a four-point lead over Dortmund in fifth place.\nA stunning goal from Real Betis\u2019s Aitor Ruibal cancelled out Jude Bellingham\u2019s strike for Real Madrid early in the second half to earn the home side a 1-1 draw in La Liga.

{"title":"The best movies of 2023 so far","context":"## The best movies of 2023 so far\n\nYour time is precious, and your options are endless. The good news: We watch it all so you don\u2019t have to. Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\nMaking a collaborative list of the year\u2019s best movies usually feels like trying to form a committee to definitively rank apples and oranges. How do you account for personal tastes? For access, when a given movie \u2014 er, fruit variety \u2014 is only available in certain markets at certain times? For the fact that apples and oranges are just so qualitatively different that they don\u2019t have a lot in common except juiciness and vitamin C content?\nFortunately, 2023 has its own peculiar answer, in the form of the Barbenheimer phenomenon. Beleaguered movie theaters got a boost this year from film fans who made an event out of seeing two radically different movies back-to-back: a slyly satirical movie about a living fashion toy, and a heavy, grim historical drama about the father of the atomic bomb. While Barbie and Oppenheimer do have a clear theme in common, they\u2019re still radically different movies. But the way they collectively dominated the 2023 box office and the cultural discussion is a strong reminder that regardless of tone or topic, a great story, told passionately, stands out. Cinephiles can be drawn to just about any movie in any genre, if it\u2019s well crafted and engaging, no matter what kind of fruit it is.\nHere at Polygon, we have pretty eclectic collective tastes: Some of us are hungriest for action, horror, epic fantasy, or challenging science fiction, while some of us prefer complicated drama or dark neo-noir, and others are drawn to musicals, comedy, animated adventures, and other lighter fare.\nOur best-of-the-year list reflects that range.\nHow the Polygon top 50 list works\nEvery year, the staff\u2019s film fans create individual ballots to reflect their top movies, with an option to rank them numerically or just weight them. We use these ballots to generate a collective list, weighted by strength of opinion to make sure a much-seen mainstream movie doesn\u2019t have too much advantage over a terrific but underseen indie. And then we put it all out there for your enjoyment. The top 10 picks on each our staff\u2019s lists will be listed in the comments.\nAny movie released in the US this calendar year is eligible, but since we are publishing this in early December, some December releases are underrepresented. We hope you\u2019ll find a new favorite here on our list of the best movies of 2023.\nHonorable mentions Movies that received votes but did not crack our top 50: The Pope\u2019s Exorcist, Bottoms, Rye Lane, No Hard Feelings, Hundreds of Beavers, Evil Dead Rise, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Nimona, The Starling Girl, Thanksgiving, Guy Ritchie\u2019s The Covenant, The Eight Mountains, The Roundup: No Way Out, The Royal Hotel, Red, White & Royal Blue, Blue Jean, The Venture Bros.: Radiant Is the Blood of the Baboon Heart, Quiz Lady, Air, Elemental, Extraction 2, Fair Play, Metalocalypse: Army of the Doomstar, A Haunting in Venice, Fast X, You Hurt My Feelings, The Super Mario Bros.

Shin Kamen Rider\nDirector: Hideaki Anno\nCast: Sosuke Ikematsu, Minami Hamabe, Tasuku Emoto\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, under the title Shin Masked Rider\nThe best superhero movie of 2023 didn\u2019t come from Marvel or DC. Instead, it came from Hideaki Anno. Shin Kamen Rider might not reach the soaring heights of Shin Godzilla, but it\u2019s an incredibly fun time bolstered by terrific costume designs, inventive action sequences, and a delightfully bizarre tone, all while looking gorgeous throughout. \u2014Pete Volk\n49. Missing\nDirectors: Nicholas D. Johnson, Will Merrick\nCast: Storm Reid, Nia Long, Ken Leung\nWhere to watch: Netflix, or for digital rental\/purchase\nIf Knives Out has proven anything, it\u2019s that people are hungry for mysteries on the big screen. Missing \u2014 the twisty and fun spiritual sequel to 2018\u2019s Searching \u2014 is what people don\u2019t know they\u2019ve been looking for. It\u2019s a web of clues, a mess of mystery, all played within the computer screen of June (Storm Reid), who\u2019s left to figure out what happened when her mom (Nia Long) doesn\u2019t return from a vacation with her boyfriend.\nThe mystery genre deserves more movies that feel big and meaty. And whether it\u2019s splashed across the big screen or just a computer one, Missing manages to bring its A-game. \u2014Zosha Millman\n48. Passages\nDirector: Ira Sachs\nCast: Franz Rogowski, Ben Whishaw, Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos\nWhere to watch: Mubi, or for digital rental\/purchase\nPerhaps the platonic ideal of an arthouse film: a messy love triangle, set in Paris, shot through with explicit sex and arresting fashion choices. Sometimes you just want to watch complicated hot people (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, Ben Whishaw, and Franz Rogowski in this case) messing with each other\u2019s heads in tops their characters couldn\u2019t possibly afford. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \u2014Oli Welsh\n47. Fist of the Condor\nDirector: Ernesto D\u00edaz Espinoza\nCast: Marko Zaror, Eyal Meyer, Gina Aguad\nWhere to watch: Hi-Yah!, free with a library card on Hoopla, free on Tubi and Plex\nFist of the Condor is a martial arts throwback where Marko Zaror (John Wick: Chapter Four) plays twin brothers at odds with each other over an ancient text. Zaror, who also choreographed the movie\u2019s fight scenes, excels. There are high-flying kicks, rapid displays of martial arts forms, and the drama inherent to great cinematic fights.\nThe movie is at its best when leaning into the action, but that\u2019s not all it has to offer. Director Ernesto D\u00edaz Espinoza shoots the landscape of Chile in a way that builds the drama of the fights and adds an element of tranquility to the chaos. For fans of martial arts cinema, Fist of the Condor is a must-watch. \u2014PV\n46. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes\nDirector: Francis Lawrence\nCast: Rachel Zegler, Tom Blyth, Peter Dinklage\nWhere to watch: Theaters\nThe Hunger Games series is one of the few where the movies are often just as good as the books. The new prequel movie, which focuses on a young President Snow (played excellently by Tom Blyth), is no exception. With a particular attention to detail and some masterful songs to really color the world, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a rare meaningful prequel that bolsters the existing narrative. \u2014Petrana Radulovic\n45. The Origin of Evil\nDirector: S\u00e9bastien Marnier\nCast: Laure Calamy, Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment, Dominique Blanc\nWhere to watch: Digital rental\/purchase\nThis French thriller is the kind of twisty story that\u2019s hard to sum up in any way without giving something away, but that\u2019s part of the appeal. S\u00e9bastien Marnier, director of the shocking 2018 prep school thriller School\u2019s Out, steers The Origin of Evil away from a neo-noir tone, even though the plot is pure noir, right down to the character types. When a woman (Laure Calamy) insinuates herself into a rich family, claiming she\u2019s a lost daughter to the patriarch, Serge (Jacques Weber), viewers will suspect she has more of an agenda than she\u2019s letting on. But Serge and the rest of his caustic family members have agendas too. Unpacking every lie and scheme in this movie takes every minute of its run time, and it\u2019s guaranteed that audience sympathies will shift half a dozen times in the process. As a crime story, it\u2019s a gem; as a character story, it\u2019s even better. \u2014Tasha Robinson\n44. They Cloned Tyrone\nDirector: Juel Taylor\nCast: John Boyega, Teyonah Parris, Jamie Foxx\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nJuel Taylor\u2019s Blaxploitation-inspired romp follows a drug dealer, a pimp, and a prostitute who inadvertently stumble upon a clandestine government facility that has been secretly experimenting on their neighborhood from the shadows. Faced with the horrifying reality of their situation, the trio band together to do the only thing they can \u2014 find a way to spread the truth and fight back against their oppressors. They Cloned Tyrone is a wild, weird, and genuinely funny comedy anchored by strong leading performances (especially in the case of Foxx\u2019s charismatic and foul-mouthed turn as Slick Charles). \u2014Toussaint Egan\n43. Broker\nDirector: Hirokazu Kore-eda\nCast: Song Kang-ho, Gang Dong-won, Bae Doona, Lee Ji-eun\nWhere to watch: Hulu, or for digital rental\/purchase\nHirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters) returns with another story about people committing crimes just to survive. This time, it\u2019s two men who sell abandoned babies on the adoption black market.\nSong Kang-ho and Bae Doona deliver electrifying performances \u2014 Song as another shifty, funny schemer who is in way over his head, and Bae as a hard-headed cop pursuing them. But it\u2019s Lee Ji-eun, as a young mother who becomes entangled in the scheme, who steals the show, with a fierce intelligence and hardened worldview concealed by a veneer of youthful innocence. Plus one very adorable baby. That never hurts. \u2014PV\n42. Creed III\nDirector: Michael B. Jordan\nCast: Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Jonathan Majors\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, MGM Plus, or for digital rental\/purchase\nIn 2015\u2019s Creed, Michael B. Jordan established his bona fides as a true movie star when he assumed the role of Adonis Creed, the lost son of Apollo Creed and heir apparent to his father\u2019s title as the heavyweight boxing champion of the world. In this year\u2019s Creed III, Jordan has taken on the mantle of the Rocky franchise and made it his own as both the film\u2019s star and director, enriching Adonis\u2019 story with a perspective and style that feels at once fresh and familiar.\nWith electrifying fight sequences and powerful lead performances, Creed III is a knockout sports drama that combines anime-inspired choreography with a powerful narrative about strained relationships and redemption. \u2014TE\n41. Infinity Pool\nDirector: Brandon Cronenberg\nCast: Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Mia Goth, Cleopatra Coleman\nWhere to watch: Hulu, or for digital rental\/purchase\nDeath doesn\u2019t have to be real in the world of Infinity Pool \u2014 at least, not if you\u2019re rich enough to turn it into a fun night out. Director Brandon Cronenberg\u2019s (2020\u2019s stellar Possessor) third film gazes into the bizarre void of identity and wonders what happens when it gazes back. Infinity Pool is queasy and fascinating, and perhaps 2023\u2019s most nihilistic view of wealth. But the real selling point are the go-for-broke central performances by Mia Goth and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd. \u2014Austen Goslin\n40. Master Gardener\nDirector: Paul Schrader\nCast: Joel Edgerton, Quintessa Swindell, Sigourney Weaver\nWhere to watch: Hulu, or for digital rental\/purchase\nThe third in Paul Schrader\u2019s thematic \u201cMan in a Room\u201d trilogy, Master Gardener follows a reformed former white supremacist (Joel Edgerton) who works as a horticulturist on a grand Southern estate. When the young Black relative (Quintessa Swindell) of the estate\u2019s owner (Sigourney Weaver) arrives, the two form an unlikely bond.\nMaster Gardener is a gorgeous movie, filled with fields of flowers and excellent performances from Edgerton and Swindell. The movie distinguishes itself from many other \u201creformed racist\u201d movies by having Edgerton\u2019s character already distanced from his past self, rather than relying on his relationship with a Black person to spur that change. He\u2019s a new person, but that doesn\u2019t erase his history. It\u2019s a wonderful coda to a superb trilogy. \u2014PV\n39. Theater Camp\nDirectors: Molly Gordon, Nick Lieberman\nCast: Jimmy Tatro, Ben Platt, Molly Gordon, Noah Galvin\nWhere to watch: Hulu, or for digital rental\/purchase\nAll great camp movies are about found family, and there are few subcultures that theme fits better than theater kids. Theater Camp, from Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman, is well aware of this and plays its excellent (and specific) jokes to the cheap seats for an audience it knows has felt its characters\u2019 pains and joys themselves.\nWhat Theater Camp understands best about its subjects is that being a theater kid means never really leaving a stage. It\u2019s all performance, whether it\u2019s for an audience, your best friend, your campmates, or alone to yourself. And it doesn\u2019t really matter if you\u2019re laughing or crying, as long as you enjoyed the show. \u2014AG\n38. BlackBerry\nDirector: Matt Johnson\nCast: Jay Baruchel, Glenn Howerton, Matt Johnson\nWhere to watch: AMC Plus, or for digital rental\/purchase\nMore Social Network than the recent streak of corporation-flavored inventopics (see: Air, Tetris, The Beanie Bubble), genre-bending filmmaker Matt Johnson\u2019s indie take on tech breakthroughs and backstabbing finds darkly comedic laughs in capitalist meltdowns. At the center of the movie: two great performances destined to fly under the radar.\nWannabe businessman Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton) initially brushes off lowly inventor Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel), until he sees a gold mine: a reimagined mobile prototype that doesn\u2019t actually work, but could definitely sell. Johnson\u2019s screenplay, co-written with his Dirties and Operative Avalanche cohort Matthew Miller, delivers all the bravado one expects from this type of rise-and-fall saga. Howerton rewires his Always Sunny Dennis persona into a true warhead, barking at Doom-playing brainiacs until they get results. Baruchel\u2019s arc as a tech genius sinking in corporate quicksand is almost a mini Breaking Bad. Johnson\u2019s touch is delivering a searing indictment of Canada\u2019s own Silicon Valley behavior with puncturing goofs and plenty of chewed-up scenery \u2014 it\u2019s a fun movie, too. The keyboard clacks and the cast absolutely roars. \u2014Matt Patches\n37. Eileen\nDirector: William Oldroyd\nCast: Thomasin McKenzie, Anne Hathaway, Shea Whigham\nWhere to watch: Theaters\nSleek and understated, Eileen takes a compact and uncomfortably close eye to a psychological thriller about ladies making bad decisions. Based on the novel by Ottessa Moshfegh \u2014 who co-wrote the script with Luke Goebel \u2014 Eileen follows its eponymous protagonist (a magnetic and fidgety Thomasin McKenzie) and her obsession with Rebecca (Anne Hathaway), a worldly and glamorous psychiatrist who begins working at the prison Eileen works at as a clerk. As the women get closer, they feed into each other\u2019s darker impulses, and upend their lives, violently. With pulpy thrills and assured direction from William Oldroyd, Eileen is a perfect anti-holiday film in the vein of David Fincher\u2019s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, a smart, edgy feel-bad good time. \u2014Joshua Rivera\n36. Earth Mama\nDirector: Savanah Leaf\nCast: Tia Nomore, Erika Alexander, Doechii\nWhere to watch: Paramount Plus, Showtime, or for digital rental\/purchase\nGia, a pregnant single mother in the Bay Area, seeks to recover her two children from foster care. The close-up is director Savanah Leaf\u2019s flex. She uses the shot with a confident abundance that few contemporaries dare. On each character, she moves in close, like a friend at a party with a secret to tell under the loud music. When that intimacy is shared with Gia herself, what differentiates Earth Mama comes into focus. We are not observing this woman from a distance; we are sitting beside her, listening closely and hoping for the best. \u2014Chris Plante\n35. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\nDirector: Wes Anderson\nCast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nBenedict Cumberbatch is a rapscallion who seeks to learn how to see without his eyes (in order to cheat at gambling). The premise is mostly immaterial. Henry Sugar, and the three other Roald Dahl stories Wes Anderson adapted for Netflix, are opportunities for the director to continue to push his aesthetic forward.\nIn his recent work, Anderson has made bare the artifice essential to filmmaking. These shorts take that even further. Actors recite Dahl\u2019s words verbatim, often speaking directly to the camera. The sets are treated like those on a theater stage, collapsing or building in real time to aid scene transitions. Even in short form, Anderson never ceases to amaze. \u2014PV\n34. M3GAN\nDirector: Gerard Johnstone\nCast: Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, Amie Donald\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, or for digital rental\/purchase\n2023 was such a big year for big conversations about AI (including AI art, AI writing, and AI style theft) that it\u2019s no surprise we\u2019re already getting a fresh wave of \u201cAI is going to murder us all\u201d horror movies. But M3GAN is a refreshingly goofy spin on that old trope \u2014 and a fairly creepy one, too. When a tech whiz (Allison Williams) has to take responsibility for her dead sister\u2019s kid, she distances herself by building a robot to handle parenting for her. It goes badly. Scripted by Akela Cooper with the same shamelessly messy, giddy verve she brought to Malignant, M3GAN is a good time for knowledgable horror fans, packed with referential humor, but still channeling some real anxiety about the place computers have in our lives and how far that\u2019ll eventually go. \u2014TR\n33. When Evil Lurks\nDirector: Demi\u00e1n Rugna\nCast: Ezequiel Rodr\u00edguez, Demi\u00e1n Salom\u00f3n, Luis Ziembrowski\nWhere to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus, or for digital rental\/purchase\nDemi\u00e1n Rugna\u2019s gory possession movie isn\u2019t just the usual barrage of religious imagery and religious anxiety: It\u2019s much more concerned with bigger, sadder thoughts on the ways our institutions keep failing us, and the ways we fail each other and ourselves. Ezequiel Rodr\u00edguez gives a mesmerizing performance as Argentinian farmer Pablo, a man estranged from his wife and in denial about his own responsibilities. When a demonic presence starts stalking his rural county, he runs to his ex-wife and the city, and brings the curse along with him. It\u2019s a shocking film that crosses lines in unusual ways for a horror film (particularly around horrors visited on children and animals), but what really makes it land is how well realized all the human drama is, more so than the demon drama. \u2014TR\n32. Polite Society\nDirector: Nida Manzoor\nCast: Priya Kansara, Ritu Arya, Nimra Bucha\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, or for digital rental\/purchase\nRia (Priya Kansara) dreams of being a stuntwoman and loves her sister deeply. So when her sis drops out of art school and gets engaged to some jabroni she\u2019s known for a month, Ria does what any of us would: Plan a wedding heist to rescue her sister from what\u2019s surely a fate worse than death.\nWith that, Polite Society vaults between genres and tones and makes it all look easy, melding the wedding-prep comedy with Ria\u2019s action thrill ride. Ria\u2019s story may be singular, but all of us can relate to the enthusiasm and care she brings to her life. (Even if the rest of us are still trying to nail our flying reverse spinning kick.) \u2014ZM\n31. Talk to Me\nDirectors: Danny Philippou, Michael Philippou\nCast: Sophie Wilde, Joe Bird, Miranda Otto, Alexandra Jensen\nWhere to watch: Digital rental\/purchase\nTalk to Me is like the horror movie version of a perfect comedy sketch. It\u2019s got a perfect premise (possession as a party drug), a brilliant turn you saw coming from the start but that hits even better than you expected, and it ends before it wears out its welcome. It helps that it\u2019s also one of the most stylish and shocking horror movies of the year.\nBetween its abrupt bursts of violence, possession-party montages, and creeping family tension, by the time Talk to Me\u2019s brisk (just under 90 minutes before the credits roll) run time is up, it feels like you were one of the lucky kids who let go of the demon hand at exactly the right moment for the maximum high. \u2014AG\n30. Skinamarink\nDirector: Kyle Edward Ball\nCast: Lucas Paul, Ross Paul, Dali Rose Tetreault\nWhere to watch: Hulu, AMC Plus, Shudder, or for digital rental\/purchase\nSkinamarink is hands down the most peculiar and divisive horror film to come out in 2023. It is also one of the best. A pair of siblings awake in the middle of the night to find their home transformed into an inescapable nightmare of yawning hallways, dimly lit corridors, and looming walls devoid of any windows or doors. As they search aimlessly for safety and familiarity in this otherworldly situation, the children find that they are not alone in the house, haunted by an unknowable entity that seems to feed on their fear, as it twists their lives into ever more frightening shapes. Or maybe not! The film\u2019s narrative is notoriously sparse and open to interpretation, but the effect is nonetheless one of the most unsettling scenarios seen this year. \u2014TE\n29. Are You There God? It\u2019s Me, Margaret\nDirector: Kelly Fremon Craig\nCast: Abby Ryder Fortson, Rachel McAdams, Benny Safdie\nWhere to watch: Starz, or for digital rental\/purchase\nJudy Blume\u2019s coming-of-age novel is one of the most challenged in the country, because of its direct discussion of puberty. But it\u2019s a staple of children\u2019s literature, and director Kelly Fremon Craig\u2019s movie is a gem. She previously wrote and directed The Edge of Seventeen, so she knows her way around crafting a relatable coming-of-age movie. As Margaret\u2019s parents, Rachel McAdams and Benny Safdie steal scenes, but Abby Ryder Fortson\u2019s earnest and endearing performance as Margaret anchors the whole film. \u2014PR\n28. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\nDirector: Jeff Rowe\nCast: Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon\nWhere to watch: Paramount Plus, or for digital rental\/purchase\nDirector Jeff Rowe and executive producer Seth Rogen\u2019s spin on the turtles asserts itself as one of the most visually impressive animated films of the post-Into the Spider-Verse era. A modern reboot of the classic TMNT origin story, Mutant Mayhem emphasizes the fact that everyone\u2019s favorite anthropomorphic reptilian warriors are, well, teenagers, with all the stupid, fun-loving shenanigans that come with being an adolescent. From the character designs and lighting to the action sequences and soundtrack, everything in the film pops with its own unique oddball charm that breathes new life into a beloved franchise. Whether you\u2019re new to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or a longtime fan, TMNT: Mutant Mayhem is a certified banger. \u2014TE\n27. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\nDirectors: Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley\nCast: Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Justice Smith\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, Paramount Plus, MGM Plus, or for digital rental\/purchase\nFar from the definition of great, ambitious filmmaking, Honor Among Thieves is nevertheless a pretty perfect romp for fantasy fans, whether or not they know the RPG or care about its rules. It\u2019s funny, fast-paced, and freewheeling, full of visual gags for the in-the-know crowd, but broad and action-driven enough to be comprehensible to people who\u2019ve never picked up a d20. Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez\u2019s companionable bard-and-barbarian relationship is a lovely model for how to include a romance-free mixed-gender friendship in a story \u2014 still a frustratingly rare thing for mainstream movies. \u2014TR\n26. Napoleon\nDirector: Ridley Scott\nCast: Joaquin Phoenix, Vanessa Kirby, Tahar Rahim\nWhere to watch: Theaters\nRather than trying to encompass the entire life of one of modern history\u2019s most important and captivating figures, Ridley Scott\u2019s biopic seeks to establish three things about Napoleon Bonaparte. First, that he was one of the greatest battle commanders, tacticians, and military men to ever live. Second, that he was a petty and weird little pervert. Third, that those first two things are deeply and irrevocably intertwined.\nTo that end, Napoleon is undeniably hilarious. Sure, it has gigantic battles, with beautiful photography and framing, and a more jaw-dropping sense of scale than almost any movie made in the last decade. But between its massive and awe-inspiring battles, Napoleon finds time to gawk at France\u2019s first emperor parading around his palace, screaming at the English about boats, and pouting about being cucked. It\u2019s the story of Bonaparte by way of Barry Lyndon, and we\u2019re all luckier for it. \u2014AG\nTop 25\n25. Jawan\nDirector: Atlee\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nThe biggest Indian movie of the year is a genre-bending, crowd-pleasing spectacle that rests on the reliably charismatic talents of star Shah Rukh Khan.\nJawan is many things, but the cleanest description of the premise is \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels meets Robin Hood.\u201d Another clean description would be \u201ceverything you want in a blockbuster movie,\u201d combining some of the year\u2019s best action, romance, and dance numbers within a compelling revenge story with a strong \u201cpower to the people\u201d message.\nThe key to Jawan\u2019s joyful success, though, is Shah Rukh Khan. One of the biggest movie stars in the world, he has returned to blockbuster cinema after a brief hiatus with Pathaan and this movie. Both are very fun and make good use of his irrepressible charisma, but Jawan shines to a different degree. It\u2019s a reminder of what blockbuster movies can be \u2014 fun and exciting, but with plenty on its mind. It\u2019s the highest-grossing Indian release of the year and the second-highest-grossing Hindi film ever. As you catch up on the year\u2019s biggest releases, don\u2019t miss this one. \u2014PV\n24. Saltburn\nDirector: Emerald Fennell\nCast: Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Rosamund Pike\nWhere to watch: Theaters, coming to Prime Video Dec. 22\nEmerald Fennell\u2019s startling, gleefully dark follow-up to Promising Young Woman is another story about toxic obsession. This time, the central figure is a social climber (Barry Keoghan, mesmerizing as ever) trying to weasel his way in among a rich family in 2000s England. It\u2019s one of the year\u2019s most polarizing films: Critics either applauded its daring or dismissed it as empty provocation, due to its graphic use of nudity, sexual imagery, and extreme behavior. But \u201cempty provocation\u201d is such an odd insult to levy at a movie from someone who so thoroughly thinks her movies through. Saltburn is visually luscious and emotionally gripping, a real feast for the senses. It\u2019s grimly funny and full of shocks. And it\u2019s a smarter, more insinuating take on the growing eat-the-rich subgenre. \u2014TR\n23. Dream Scenario\nDirector: Kristoffer Borgli\nCast: Nicolas Cage, Julianne Nicholson, Michael Cera\nWhere to watch: Theaters\nThere is nothing special about Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage). He\u2019s a frumpy college professor in a small, cold town. He has a wife and daughter and students that take his biology class because it\u2019s required. And he has started to appear in the dreams of everyone in the world. Writer-director Kristoffer Borgli\u2019s black comedy about viral fame gives audiences plenty to ponder, with sudden turns both hilarious and deeply uncomfortable. All of it is held together thanks to a tremendous performance from Cage, in his best role since 2021\u2019s stunner Pig. In Cage\u2019s hands, Paul Matthews\u2019 plight, while farcical, stays grounded in humanity, and all the petty, cringeworthy foibles that come with it. \u2014JR\n22. The Zone of Interest\nDirector: Jonathan Glazer\nCast: Christian Friedel, Sandra H\u00fcller, Ralph Herforth\nWhere to watch: Theaters\nThe Zone of Interest is set mere feet from the walls of Auschwitz, at the home of commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss (Christian Friedel) and his family. The H\u00f6ss family builds their life in this small estate, with a fancy house, and Mrs. H\u00f6ss\u2019 (Sandra H\u00fcller) carefully curated garden, while the horrible sounds and black smoke of the concentration camp constantly seep over their protective walls.\nDirector Jonathan Glazer\u2019s camera never really goes inside the camp, or shows the prisoners huddled there or their actual fates. Rudolf is careful to never speak about his job while at home.\nThis may sound like it sidelines the tragedy and horror of the Holocaust, centering the story on the culprits rather than the victims, but Glazer\u2019s carefully measured detachment lets the situation speak for itself, as the quiet part gets louder and more horrific throughout the film. This creates a completely different kind of Holocaust film from almost any we\u2019ve ever seen, and one that is essential in understanding the scale and depth of its evils. \u2014AG\n21. Priscilla\nDirector: Sofia Coppola\nCast: Cailee Spaeny, Jacob Elordi, Dagmara Domi\u0144czyk\nWhere to watch: Theaters\nI won\u2019t spoil it, but perhaps the best needle drop of the year arrives at the end of this Priscilla Presley biopic: a stone-cold tear-jerker so apt it takes your breath away, and a song with a complex history that adds multiple layers of delicious dramatic irony to the scene. Nobody ever accused Sofia Coppola of lacking taste. Adapted from Priscilla\u2019s memoir about life with Elvis \u2014 who groomed her to be his companion from the age of 14 \u2014 Priscilla is a dreamy, uneasy, claustrophobic study of life in a gilded cage (a Coppola specialty). Cailee Spaeny and Jacob Elordi are stunning in the lead roles, and Coppola, empathetic as ever, is careful neither to let Elvis off the hook nor damn this damaged man completely. It\u2019s a fascinating companion piece for Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis, a brassier study of the man as performer that only skirts his domestic life, but shows he had a cage of his own to contend with. \u2014OW\n20. Anatomy of a Fall\nDirector: Justine Triet\nCast: Sandra H\u00fcller, Swann Arlaud, Milo Machado-Graner\nWhere to watch: Theaters\nThe premise could set up a tacky 1990s courtroom drama or erotic thriller: A woman\u2019s husband falls from a balcony and dies while she was in the house. Did she do it? Anatomy of a Fall is not one of those movies, but it\u2019s not not one of those movies either. Justine Triet\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or-winning procedural is not a thriller, but it is thrilling; and even though Triet stubbornly refuses to pick any of the obvious ways her film could resolve itself, it achieves a deep and lingering payoff anyway. Anatomy of a Fall is a hypnotic well of a movie in which the truth of what happened only seems to recede the deeper you dive into it. That\u2019s a bold, almost sadistic choice, but the sleek presentation, sharp script, and riveting performance by Sandra H\u00fcller \u2014 perhaps the year\u2019s best by any actor \u2014 keep you on the hook. \u2014OW\n19. Knock at the Cabin\nDirector: M. Night Shyamalan\nCast: Dave Bautista, Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, Rupert Grint\nWhere to watch: Prime Video, or for digital rental\/purchase\nThis recent stretch of M. Night Shyamalan films has marked a fascinating chapter in the career of one of the most idiosyncratic directors working today. Coming off of the success of 2021\u2019s Old, Knock at the Cabin marks Shyamalan\u2019s return to one of the most understated yet prevailing themes of his work: religious terror and despair in the face of the unexplainable.\nThe film follows a family (Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, and Kristen Cui) who, after traveling to a secluded cabin in rural Pennsylvania for a vacation trip, find themselves menaced by a group of four heavily armed intruders who refuse to let them leave. The family is presented with a warning and an ultimatum: Every single person on the planet is about to die, and the only way to prevent this catastrophe is for one of them to choose to sacrifice themselves for the sake of humanity. As the family struggles to escape from their captors, the undeniable weight of their situation begins to set in. Could their kidnappers be telling the truth? And if so, would any of them be willing to submit to the unthinkable cruelty of their fate?\nKnock at the Cabin is a film that challenges its audience to look inward for the answer to these questions, all the while witnessing its story unfold. This is not a horror movie whose horrors rely on brutality and gore \u2014 though there is certainly that and then some \u2014 but one whose apocalyptic premise provokes both outright terror and disquieting introspective dread. \u2014TE\n18. Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\nDirector: Christopher McQuarrie\nCast: Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Hayley Atwell\nWhere to watch: Digital rental\/purchase\nTom Cruise loves popcorn and movies, and nobody made a better popcorn movie in 2023 than Dead Reckoning Part One. While it fell some way short of the series\u2019 critical and commercial peak, Fallout \u2014 mistakes were made, chiefly putting \u201cPart One\u201d in the title \u2014 the seventh (seventh!) Mission: Impossible film is another shockingly confident and artful action movie that delivers set-piece after astounding set-piece over a breathless two and a half hours.\nAt its center, controversially edging Cruise\u2019s slinky pas-de-deux with Rebecca Ferguson out of the frame, is a new, more kinetic and balletic partnership between the star and Hayley Atwell. In the movie\u2019s best sequences (the Rome car chase, the train carriage climax), the pair somehow blend jaw-dropping practical stunt work with ballroom dancing, silent slapstick, and rom-com meet-cute \u2014 a perfect, fizzing cocktail of a century of cinematic sugar highs. \u2014OW\n17. The Killer\nDirector: David Fincher\nCast: Michael Fassbender, Tilda Swinton, Sophie Charlotte\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nThe Killer, like the assassin at its center, is difficult to pin down. It\u2019s astonishingly gorgeous and well made, but at the same time stubbornly unflashy. It\u2019s bleak and violent, but at the same time hilarious and irreverent. It\u2019s fascinated with exploring the ideas of how media shapes identity, but completely resistant to assigning any actual meaning. The Killer is the kind of movie that can throw in a fight scene for five minutes that\u2019s better than almost any fight in a mainstream movie this year, then never go back to hand-to-hand combat again. In other words, it\u2019s a David Fincher movie through and through.\nFincher is famous for his precision on set and his dedication for finely honing every aspect of his films until they\u2019re exactly what he needs. And yet, his movies never feel stodgy, tight, or lifeless; he makes it look easy. And that\u2019s where The Killer truly excels. It breezes by every assassin movie and thriller trope, executing each one flawlessly, all while making a snide comment about it. It\u2019s the kind of movie that feels so effortless and smooth that it makes you wonder why all movies can\u2019t be this good. But that\u2019s Fincher\u2019s gift; his films have the kind of quality and handmade perfection so precise it can be mistaken for the work of factory machines\u2026 until you look a little closer. \u2014AG\n16. Ferrari\nDirector: Michael Mann\nCast: Adam Driver, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Shailene Woodley\nWhere to watch: In theaters Dec. 25\nBetween Ferrari and Oppenheimer, it\u2019s been a fabulous year for biopics about bastards doing tremendously dangerous things.\nThe Enzo Ferrari biopic\u2019s standout sequences are unquestionably its races, which director Michael Mann infuses with tension, speed, and horror. The movie goes to great lengths to show us how dangerous auto racing is, and every time someone gets into a car, Mann translates that danger into a palpable tension. But what\u2019s most surprising about Ferrari is that its most thrilling sequences are those that clear the way for Adam Driver\u2019s performance as Enzo.\nThe movie is an incredible portrait of a man who was a perfect concoction of some of Mann\u2019s favorite things: obsessive, brilliant, awful, detached, and a winner through and through. The film, and Driver\u2019s exceptional performance, make Ferrari\u2019s ambition and passion deeply clear. The painful determination driving him is absolutely electric to watch \u2014 even more exciting than the races, which is saying something. \u2014AG\n15. Poor Things\nDirector: Yorgos Lanthimos\nCast: Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe\nWhere to watch: Theaters\nIf there were an award for unlikeliest but most effective Oscar bait, it would go to this reunion of The Favourite star Emma Stone; its Greek surrealist director, Yorgos Lanthimos; and its screenwriter, Tony McNamara. Poor Things is tipped to win a few real Oscars, despite making The Favourite look like a normal movie. It\u2019s a deeply weird, neo-Frankenstinian fable about a reanimated woman\u2019s quest for independence, identity, and the meaning of life. Yep \u2014 along with everything else, Poor Things is also goth Barbie.\nAdapted from a cult novel by the eccentric Scottish writer, illustrator, and typesetter Alasdair Gray, Poor Things reworks Frankenstein to explore themes of feminism, sex, and social rot. Lanthimos doubles down on the baroque stylings of The Favourite to create an astonishingly visually dense film composed of outlandish costumes, lavish sets, and fantastical painted backgrounds, often shot through woozy fish-eye lenses. It\u2019s also, surprisingly, one of the year\u2019s most hilarious movies, in no small part thanks to Mark Ruffalo\u2019s game campery and McNamara\u2019s cleverly twisted syntax. But the movie is Stone\u2019s. Her performance is fearless, frank, funny, and intensely physical. Bella is no less than a deconstructed human being, and to watch her slowly reassemble herself is to fall in love with the character: an insatiable, ferocious force of nature, whose appetite for life and love for humanity never dim, despite their many disappointments. \u2014OW\n14. Suzume\nDirector: Makoto Shinkai\nCast: Nanoka Hara, Hokuto Matsumura\nWhere to watch: Crunchyroll\nMakoto Shinkai\u2019s career seems to have been building up to Suzume. It has all the hallmarks of Shinkai\u2019s recent, most popular works: a young couple brought together by strange fantastical elements, a looming disaster threatening to upend the world, and clear blue skies. But everything that didn\u2019t quite work in Your Name and Weathering with You manages to coalesce together in Suzume.\nWhile Suzume is about two young people banding together to save the world from disaster, it is equally about Suzume, the protagonist, overcoming her own trauma. As she travels cross-country with an animated chair (who is actually a handsome and mysterious young man), she starts to connect with other people, instead of closing herself off. Her quest to stop a giant earthquake-creating worm comes from the fact that she lost her mother in the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. Slowly but surely, throughout her journey, she rediscovers her will to live and realizes that her life is not disposable. Unlike Shinkai\u2019s other works, the romance is subtle, the barest hint of it actually, and that just makes it resonate even more.\nIt\u2019s a beautifully haunting story, rooted in a real-world tragedy that makes it resonate even more. \u2014PR\n13. Godzilla Minus One\nDirector: Takashi Yamazaki\nCast: Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada\nWhere to watch: Theaters\nGodzilla fans aren\u2019t wanting for new media, including the recent Apple TV series Monarch. These recent releases, while enjoyable, have taken a distinctly Hollywood approach, building out a mythology in the style of the MCU. Godzilla Minus One is the first Japanese live-action Godzilla film from Toho since the brilliant, post-Fukushima Shin Godzilla. And it returns to the original recipe.\nMinus One is a throwback: to the post-WWII Tokyo setting, to 1950s human melodrama, and to a kaiju singularly focused on the obliteration of large, human-made structures. Its hero, Koichi Shikishima, is a kamikaze pilot who, in the final days of the war, fakes a technical issue with his plane, taking shelter in a repair facility on a small island that just so happens to be in the path of a certain teenage lizard monster.\nHow Shikishima builds relationships with a wide cast of lovable surrounding characters elevates Minus One above other giants. Where Shin Godzilla chronicled a government response to disaster, Minus One pins its hopes on civilians who \u2014 failed by their leaders and the world \u2014 must rely on each other. \u2014CP\n12. John Wick: Chapter 4\nDirector: Chad Stahelski\nCast: Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Ian McShane\nWhere to watch: Starz, or for digital rental\/purchase\nJohn Wick has only ever wanted to fuck off and retire, and no one seems to get the message. Chad Stahelski\u2019s saga about the boogeyman of assassins in a world full of them reaches a staggering crescendo in Chapter 4, a film that somehow manages to run faster and hit harder than three previous movies dedicated to constant escalation. Facing off against action legends Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins, Keanu Reeves pushes John Wick harder and farther than before in a film that rages against the untouchably wealthy, and their expectation that the world be in their service. \u2014JR\n11. May December\nDirector: Todd Haynes\nCast: Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, Charles Melton\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nElizabeth (Natalie Portman) arrives in Savannah to prepare for a new role based on Gracie (Julianne Moore), a grown woman who slept with 13-year-old Joe (Charles Melton) and subsequently married him. Elizabeth comes with an open mind, ready to inhabit Gracie and fully understand her. And yet, across Todd Haynes\u2019 May December, we see how nothing is as simple as Elizabeth \u2014 or the audience \u2014 thinks. Gracie is always more than meets the eye: more emotional, more aware, more monstrous. And throughout the movie, Haynes expertly teases out the two women\u2019s mysteries as they each try to craft an identity around the other.\nHaynes\u2019 film certainly has callbacks to other, classic movies about selfhood. But in a way, May December feels most in line with something like The Rehearsal, which also has a lot on its mind about how blurry the line between real life and performance can be, and particularly how traumatic it is to ask kids to behave like adults. It\u2019s something Melton\u2019s Joe is tragically caught in the middle of, and something May December always has on its mind, even when it feels like it\u2019s about other things. As Gracie and Elizabeth obsess over little details, May December lets Melton make the case for the quiet, seething corruption at the heart of the film. \u2014ZM\nTop 10\n10. Showing Up\nDirector: Kelly Reichardt\nCast: Michelle Williams, Hong Chau, John Magaro\nWhere to watch: Digital rental\/purchase\nLizzy (Michelle Williams) is a 30-something artist living on campus at her hometown art school. She wants two things in life: time to prepare for her exhibition, and her landlord, Jo (Hong Chau), to fix her hot water heater. Superficially, there\u2019s little more to Lizzy\u2019s plight, for the better. Director and co-writer Kelly Reichardt never permits the stakes to rise too high or the plot to get too complicated. Because this film, at its core, is about working artists working in less financially stable mediums, like ceramic figurines and trippy visual projections. Without plot filling the film, we have time to just be present in this beautiful Pacific Northwest scene.\nReichardt\u2019s genius is getting the audience giggling at the artists but never the art. For example, it\u2019s funny to think that an artist dedicated a year of her life to crocheting a jumpsuit. Except then, in Showing Up, you see the outfit and it\u2019s beautiful \u2014 an intentional undermining of the punchline. A teacher smugly opines on ceramics, but each piece he holds up is so lovingly crafted that they confidently speak for themselves.\nThis decision (rib artists, celebrate art) sets the tone. We humans are artifice, a bunch of contradictory masks that we put on to match the situation and the crowd. But our creations \u2014 when we commit to a craft, whatever medium it may be \u2014 are an expression of our most vulnerable selves.\nI suppose I knew this on some subconscious level, but Reichardt, as with so many of her films, helped me mine the epiphany from my brain or heart or wherever I was keeping it. She knows that art, when created from that place of sincere intent, deserves compassion and respect \u2014 even if its creator is still a desperate, self-conscious ball of anxiety. And now I know it too. \u2014CP\n9. Barbie\nDirector: Greta Gerwig\nCast: Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Will Ferrell\nWhere to watch: Digital rental\/purchase before streaming on Max\nAny description of Barbie\u2019s big themes (toxic masculinity, how Barbie branding affects young girls, women as playthings, the commodification of girl power) makes it sound preachy and stilted. But writer-director Greta Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach never hold still for long enough that viewers will feel like they\u2019re sitting through a Gender Studies 101 class. They package these ideas into a giddy satire full of bright and winning performances, pointed jokes aimed at Mattel and the corporate world, terrific casting (Issa Rae as President Barbie, Simu Liu as one of many Kens, and Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie are standouts), and endless cultural gags. And then there are the bright, poppy meta-humor musical numbers, including Ryan Gosling turning \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d into 2023\u2019s top movie anthem.\nPerky, playful, and deceptively caustic, Barbie is one of just a few films (like 1995\u2019s The Brady Bunch Movie and 2007\u2019s Enchanted) that gleefully satirize a cultural staple while also treating it with real affection. Margot Robbie makes a perfect Barbie, whether she\u2019s in perky-and-plastic mode or slowly revealing her underlying humanity, as fears of death and dying leak into the endless party of Barbieland. There\u2019s so much going on in this patter-filled, joke-a-second comedy that it feels like 2023\u2019s Everything Everywhere All at Once, right down to the big life messages smuggled into all the goofery. It\u2019s a high-speed joke-fest that doesn\u2019t take Barbie any more seriously than she deserves \u2014 but does pay solemn homage to all the ways, positive and negative, that Barbie fandom makes people feel. \u2014TR\n8. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\nDirectors: Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, Justin K. Thompson\nCast: Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Daniel Kaluuya\nWhere to watch: Netflix, or for digital rental\/purchase\n2018\u2019s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse changed the game for superhero movies and animated movies. It raised the bar for what a Spider-Man story could be, and inspired animators to push the boundaries of what their movies could look like. Maybe Hollywood as a whole took away the wrong lesson (we\u2019ve seen so many multiverse movies), but Into the Spider-Verse redefined genre staples.\nThe sequel continues to raise the bar. It\u2019s a little busier than the first, pulling in more characters, more frantic visuals, more emotional throughlines, but it\u2019s still bold, daring, and unlike anything else in the superhero movie sphere.\nAs the characters bounce across the multiverse, the animation style shifts, with each character rooted in a different style. Spider-Gwen\u2019s world is rendered with watercolors, which shift according to the tone of her story. She gets a step up in this movie \u2014 a second chance for Gwen Stacy, whose previous iterations across media have not ended well. Meanwhile, Spider-Punk, the brash counterculture rebel, is made up of collaged bits, and animated against the norm so he stands out even more. Every frame of the movie is a visual feast, just bursting with lovingly rendered details.\nWith a bigger cast and higher stakes, Across the Spider-Verse wasn\u2019t going to finish its story in just one movie. It ends on a huge cliffhanger, but all the pieces are in place for one hell of a trilogy finale. \u2014PR\n7. The Boy and the Heron\nDirector: Hayao Miyazaki\nCast: Soma Santoki, Masaki Suda, Ko Shibasaki\nWhere to watch: Theaters\nTexture is essential to Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s work. Sometimes the most visceral memories of his movies are the ways liquids glob or glide, while wood flecks flint and flake in tiny explosions. Famously, even his still shots contain some motion, often featuring the slightest of movements that make the world feel more full \u2014 more real.\nThe Boy and the Heron, for all its fantastical realms and magical happenings, follows the same ethos, constantly grounding itself in the feel of Miyazaki\u2019s style and knack for characters drawn into strange worlds. This time it\u2019s 11-year-old Mahito, who\u2019s bored and miserable after moving to the country following his mother\u2019s death in a World War II bombing. His grief has a touch familiar to those who have lived with it: bland and isolating. But the touch of Miyazaki\u2019s work is always deeper, and it\u2019s not too long before an errant heron proves the veil between Mahito and his more vivid dream world is much thinner than he knew.\nBut no matter which side of the fantastic we\u2019re on, The Boy and the Heron makes the texture of the world feel enthralling. Little details \u2014 a bandage loosening in water or a granny\u2019s gait \u2014 weave together, building a world that feels at once like anything Studio Ghibli has made and wholly its own. It manages to meditate on its themes without lingering, never letting its story falter (even as our hero languishes in his country tedium). No one is going to be on the other side of an argument calling Hayao Miyazaki the GOAT (at least, nobody I care to talk to). But The Boy and the Heron shows that he is always game to top himself, finding new ways to add layers to every part of his work. \u2014ZM\n6. Asteroid City\nDirector: Wes Anderson\nCast: Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, and many more\nWhere to watch: Peacock, or for digital rental\/purchase\nTo people who don\u2019t know Wes Anderson\u2019s work well, he\u2019s a known quantity that\u2019s easily replicated and parodied: If you\u2019re watching one of his films, you\u2019re going to see a lot of fast-talking people responding with unemotive calm to extraordinary events, against a backdrop of meticulously designed pastel sets. But fans see a lot of nuance within that formula, as Anderson\u2019s voice (especially his sense of humor) develops from film to film.\nIn Asteroid City, his ridiculously meta story-within-a-story sci-fi film about an alien encounter, that voice hones in on the question of art and creativity \u2014 who it\u2019s for, what it brings the artist and the audience, why any form of recognition or acclaim is good enough for one creator while another strains to find connection and resonance in their work. It\u2019s the kind of film that moves so quickly, and with so little attempt to hold the audience\u2019s hands and tell them what to feel, that it takes some work to scratch the surface.\nBut it\u2019s worth diving into the movie\u2019s connections and themes, as a who\u2019s who of actors \u2014 many from Anderson\u2019s usual stable, and some debuting here \u2014 bounce off each other, looking for meaning in an isolated desert setting. The cast (including Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Jason Schwartzman, Jeffrey Wright, Sophia Lillis, Edward Norton, and many, many more) navigate familial death, meaningless plaudits, and that alien visitor with the same straight-faced aplomb. This may not be a movie designed for passionate emotional response, but as usual for Anderson, it\u2019s remarkably specific, idiosyncratic, beautifully assembled, and absolutely intentional. \u2014TR\n5. How to Blow Up a Pipeline\nDirector: Daniel Goldhaber\nCast: Ariela Barer, Lukas Gage, Forrest Goodluck\nWhere to watch: Hulu, or for digital rental\/purchase\nAn unconventional adaptation of the controversial 2021 nonfiction novel, How to Blow Up a Pipeline applies the ethos of the book (which argued sabotage is a necessary part of environmental activism) to a fictional scenario. In the movie, a group of people from different walks of life \u2014 students, disillusioned activists, service workers, punks \u2014 gather in Texas with a plan: Blow up an oil pipeline and finally enact some real change. And the movie absolutely rules.\nThe movie takes the best parts of the heist thriller genre (a likable crew who each brings their own specialized skills, a worthy cause, a focus on the process, a tense finale) and discards the rest (notably, there is no major police\/investigator B-plot). It\u2019s a perfect marriage of the genre and the movie\u2019s radical politics, without sacrificing either. Pipeline is also just an impeccably crafted movie, with strong location work that makes the most of America\u2019s vast landscapes, hinting at past beauty ruined by industrialization. And it\u2019s all supported by great performances from emerging stars, especially Forrest Goodluck (The Revenant), who excels as a quiet, awkward, self-taught explosives expert.\nOne of the buzziest and most controversial movies of the year, don\u2019t mistake it for an empty vehicle for controversy; How to Blow Up a Pipeline is a thoughtful, masterful work that weaves in the principles of what makes heist thrillers fun to great effect. 2023 has had many great movies, but none feel as urgent and timely as this one. \u2014PV\n4. Killers of the Flower Moon\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, Robert De Niro\nWhere to watch: Theaters, or for digital rental\/purchase\nErnest Burkhart loves money. It\u2019s one of the first things he says when he arrives in Oklahoma, fresh off the Great War\u2019s killing fields and into the arms of his manipulative uncle, William Hale. Together, they will help turn this land, home of the Osage Nation, into another killing field. For 206 minutes, we will watch them.\nKillers of the Flower Moon is an act of lamentation. A cinematic wail against one of the many foundational horrors of these United States, a crime that is still in living memory, its ill-gotten gains still propping up any claim to prosperity the nation has today.\nWith tremendous conviction, director Martin Scorsese\u2019s reverent, methodical film adapts David Grann\u2019s 2017 account of the reign of terror that plagued the Osage in the 1920s, paring back the sprawling story to focus on Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), Hale (Robert De Niro) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), the Osage woman who would marry Burkhart and pay for it with the lives of her entire family.\nThrough the Burkhart marriage, Scorsese renders the crimes committed against the Osage in miniature, three and a half hours of rumination on the theft and bloodshed that watered the prosperity of white America, endured in stifled silence for a century. Monumental and sobering, Killers of the Flower Moon trembles at the evil that has been grafted onto our collective story, and mourns the voices that will never get to be a part of it. \u2014JR\n3. The Holdovers\nDirector: Alexander Payne\nCast: Paul Giamatti, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph, Dominic Sessa\nWhere to watch: Theaters, or digital rental\/purchase\nIf you hate sentimental, cliched \u201cabandoned kid and aging curmudgeon create found family\u201d movies like I hate them, The Holdovers is a guaranteed surprise. The latest from Alexander Payne (Election, Nebraska), scripted by Kitchen Confidential creator and writer David Hemingson, reunites Payne with his Sideways star Paul Giamatti, playing a buoyantly stuffy professor at a \u201970s private boys\u2019 prep school, where he\u2019s tasked with overseeing \u201cthe holdovers\u201d \u2014 the kids who are staying at the school for Christmas while all their more fortunate classmates head home or out on adventurous holidays.\nThe Holdovers is full of sudden twists, mostly backstory reveals suitable for a particularly startling stage play. But the real surprise is how personal and specific it becomes, and excellent writing and acting help it dodge the expected parameters for this kind of story. Eventually, it settles into a three-hander between Professor Hunham (Giamatti), his troubled adolescent student Angus (Dominic Sessa, in an intense star-making performance), and Mary (Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph), the school\u2019s head cook, an older Black woman mourning her son\u2019s recent death in the military.\nAll three of these characters get room to develop and reveal themselves, and they\u2019re all handled with sensitivity and real warmth that goes far beyond the usual sentimental holiday feel-good fare. (If anything, this is a pretty dark story, and not in a laughable Bad Santa kind of way.) It\u2019s a beautifully calibrated, touching drama about starting over when there\u2019s no other choice available. \u2014TR\n2. Past Lives\nDirector: Celine Song\nCast: Greta Lee, Teo Yoo, John Magaro\nWhere to watch: Available for digital rental\/purchase\nA radiant romantic drama with a shiver of tension running through it, Past Lives is about a love that might have been. But it\u2019s also about a person who might have been (or two people, or three). As well as romantic relationships, it\u2019s a movie about the complicated relationships people have with themselves: especially the various versions of themselves who exist in the past, the present, the future, and on the paths not taken.\nIt unfolds in three time frames. In Seoul, around the turn of the millennium, Na Young and Hae Sung are 12-year-old classmates and best friends who might be starting to develop deeper feelings for each other, but Na Young\u2019s family is planning to emigrate to Canada. 12 years later, Na Young has changed her name to Nora Moon (Greta Lee) and is a young writer living in New York; she falls into an intense Skype affair with Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), but plans to visit each other never come together. In another 12 years, Nora is still in New York with her husband, Arthur (John Magaro), and Hae Sung comes to visit, threatening to destabilize all their lives.\nIt\u2019s a film of almost impossible delicacy. Writer-director Celine Song and her brilliant trio of actors hold so much within Past Lives\u2019 patient frame \u2014 unspoken feelings, unrealized possibilities, layers of cultural subtext \u2014 that you find yourself holding your breath while watching it, even before it gets to its heart-stopping final scene. The 35mm film cinematography by director of photography Shabier Kirchner (Small Axe) absolutely glows, too. Past Lives has a lot to say about the immigrant experience and about the uncertain spaces between childhood and adulthood. It has a philosophical, maybe even spiritual dimension, too. But this all emerges quite naturally from a simple, beautifully observed, and achingly romantic story that anyone can relate to about the sweet pain of the one that got away. \u2014OW\n1. Oppenheimer\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\nCast: Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh\nWhere to watch: Theaters and for digital rental\/purchase before streaming on Peacock\nIs there much left to say about the United States\u2019 criminal, moral compromise in dropping the atomic bomb or the obviously tortured psychology of the bomb\u2019s creator, J. Robert Oppenheimer? Maybe not, but as Christopher Nolan proves in his biopic on the life of the theoretical physicist, there\u2019s plenty left to feel. Cross-cutting through time at lighting speed, and smashing together facts in ways its source material, the exhaustive biography American Prometheus, can\u2019t in bound form, Nolan\u2019s action-movie sensibilities split the very atoms of his subject to understand not the what, but the how and why.\nBouncing from the early days of a daydreaming scientist to the congressional hearings of his eventual political confidant to Oppy\u2019s eventual time at Los Alamos, his $2 billion built-from-the-ground-up research base, Nolan litters the drama with factual detail ripped straight from the book. Yet at every turn, he ditches the Bohemian Rhapsody school of explanation to handwave away complicated mathematical explanation and legalese that might tie a complicated situation up in knots. Like in everything from The Dark Knight to Dunkirk, stakes do the talking \u2014 Oppenheimer must end the war. Throughout time he wrestles with turbulent family life, the burial scrutiny of a blacklist-giddy government that wants names of his Communist pals, and the heartbreaking fact that the Jewish people, his people, are under attack\u2026 but it all comes back to the bomb. There\u2019s a ticking clock, and yet again, Nolan takes full advantage.\nPart heist movie, part courtroom drama, part dreamscape, the swirl of Oppenheimer is at constant crescendo thanks to a kinetic camera, Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s humming score, and what might be the most stacked cast in movie history. Every IMAX-sized close-up of Cillian Murphy reveals layers to Oppenheimer that are easily assumed. Robert Downey Jr. takes the right lessons from Tony Stark to imbue Oppenheimer\u2019s political adversary, Lewis Strauss, with swagger. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, and so many more all show up to deliver \u2014 and yet there\u2019s still room for The Santa Clause\u2019s David Krumholtz to be the MVP. They all fire off life-or-death lines, sweat under the pressure of the job, stagger backward when they realize what they\u2019ve done, and under the eye of Nolan, reach the quantum realm of impossible choices. Oppenheimer has a magnitude worthy of the Trinity tests, but most admirable is that it never fetishizes the accomplishment of the bomb. The end will leave a person absolutely furious, as it must. \u2014MP\n\nThis article, authored by Pete Volk, was published by Polygon on 2023-10-07 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":94}

Please try again later {{ \/verifyErrors }}\nMattel has been criticised for its new Barbie doll honouring Wilma Mankiller, the first female Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation.\nLast month, Mattel announced that it was releasing a doll of Mankiller, who inspired countless Native American children as a powerful but humble leader who expanded early education and rural healthcare. The creation of the doll is part of the toy company\u2019s \u201cInspiring Women\u201d series. On 6 December, the Cherokee Nation also hosted an event to to celebrate the Wilma Mankiller Barbie.\nMankiller was the nation\u2019s first female Principal Chief, leading the tribe for a decade until 1995. She focused on improving social conditions through consensus and on restoring pride in Native heritage. The social worker, who died in 2010, met snide remarks about her surname \u2014 a military title \u2014 with humour, often delivering a straight-faced response: \u201cMankiller is actually a well-earned nickname.\u201d\nAs noted by Mattel, the Barbie doll of Mankiller portrays her dark hair, as the toy \u201cwears a richly pigmented turquoise dress with ribbon striping that represents the four directions: north, south, east and west\u201d. The toy also comes with a basket, with her look inspired by an iconic photo of Mankiller where she\u2019s holding a woven basket.\nHowever, Mattel has now faced some criticism over the doll, with people calling the toy company out for inaccuracies. Chuck Hoskin Jr, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, noted to The New York Times that the doll\u2019s basket wasn\u2019t authentically Cherokee. He also specified that the wrong sets of symbols used for the Cherokee language were included in the packaging of the doll. As a result, the symbols on the package read \u201cChicken Nation\u201d as opposed to Cherokee Nation\u201d.\n\u201cTo someone who doesn\u2019t read Cherokee syllabary, they\u2019re not going to notice it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the Cherokee people for whom Wilma is of such enduring significance and we have such enduring love for her, to see our seal incorrect, it\u2019s very disappointing because it would not have taken much effort or thought to avoid that.\u201d\nHoskin specified that he learned about the creation of the doll six months ago, and that Mattel did not work directly with the Cherokee Nation. However, he specified that the company has been understanding of the criticism.\n\u201cAfter some of the problems were revealed, we had very good conversations with Mattel. And I think they responded internally to us in a very thoughtful way and expressed some regret for not engaging us,\u201d he said.\nThe Cherokee Nation issued a statement regarding the criticism. \u201cRegrettably, the Mattel company did not work directly with the tribal government\u2019s design and communications team to secure the official Seal or verify it,\u201d the tribe said.\nMattel spokesperson Devin Tucker said the company is aware of the problem with the syllabary and is \u201cdiscussing options\u201d. The company worked with Mankiller\u2019s estate, which is led by her husband, Charlie Soap, and her friend, Kristina Kiehl, on the creation of the doll.\nSome Cherokee women were also critical of the doll, with claims that Mattel overlooked the problematic details on the doll and the packaging.\n\u201cMixed emotions shared by me and many other Cherokee women who have now purchased the product revolve around whether a Wilma Barbie captures her legacy, her physical features and the importance of centering Cherokee women in decision making,\u201d Stacy Leeds, the law school dean at Arizona State University and a former Cherokee Nation Supreme Court justice, told The Associated Press in an email.\nRegina Thompson, a Cherokee basket weaver who grew up near Tahlequah, doesn\u2019t think the doll looks like Mankiller. Mattel should have considered traditional pucker toe moccasins, instead of black shoes, and included symbols on the basket that Cherokees use to tell a story, she said.\n\u201cWilma\u2019s name is the only thing Cherokee on that box,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cNothing about that doll is Wilma, nothing.\u201d\nFollowing the release of the doll in November, Hoskin had issued a statement to express how meaningful the creation was to the Cherokee Nation.\n\u201cWhen Native girls see it, they can achieve it, and Wilma Mankiller has shown countless young women to be fearless and speak up for Indigenous and human rights. She not only served in a role dominated by men during a time that tribal nations were suppressed, but she led,\u201d he said. \u201cWilma Mankiller is a champion for the Cherokee Nation, for Indian Country, and even my own daughter. She truly exemplifies leadership, culture and equality and we applaud Mattel for commemorating her in the Barbie Inspiring Women Series.\u201d\nMankiller, whose likeness is on a US quarter issued in 2021, is the second Native American woman honoured with a Barbie doll. Famed aviator Bessie Coleman, who was of Black and Cherokee ancestry, was depicted earlier this year. Other dolls in the \u201cInspiring Women\u201d series include Maya Angelou, Ida B Wells, Jane Goodall and Madam CJ Walker.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nThis article, authored by Amber Raiken, was published by The Independent - Life and Style on 2023-12-06 under the category 'entertainment'.\n\n","id":95}
{"title":"Discogs\u2019 vibrant vinyl community is shattering","context":"## Discogs\u2019 vibrant vinyl community is shattering\n\nIf you are a devoted vinyl collector, an obsessive music fan, or \u2014 as is often the case \u2014 both, Discogs is very nearly a lifestyle. The site has become the internet\u2019s foremost database of recorded music and one of the most extensive marketplaces available for physical music media, with every bit of it generated and offered by users. You can catalog your collection, look up information about even the most obscure artists, cross-check record store prices to see if your local shop has a markup, and purchase records, typically at something close to their \u201cmarket rate.\u201d\n\u201cSome people just buy records for the album art hanging on the wall,\u201d says Doug Martin, who started selling on Discogs in 2020. But the Discogs users were different. \u201cThese were real fans listening to real music who cared about the format and the medium. That\u2019s what attracted me in the beginning.\u201d\nThe site has become a central part of the music internet, surviving through physical music media\u2019s replacement by MP3s and then streaming \u2014 and rebounding as interest in vinyl, CDs, and tapes did throughout the 2010s. But sellers who use the platform say the site\u2019s old tech has started to wear on them, and new fees and restrictions have made it harder to do business. Changes within the company are threatening to turn a bastion for vinyl fans, record stores, and anyone who cares about music into just another dysfunctional website \u2014 and dismantle a singular record of music history, even if just by pushing the sellers and users who have created that record away.\nA fastidiously detailed Wikipedia for music\nWhat was initially conceived of as something of a Wikipedia for recorded music \u2014 although, founded in 2000 by Intel programmer Kevin Lewandowski, it predates the encyclopedia site by a few months \u2014 hasn\u2019t changed a great deal since its conception, besides the introduction of the marketplace in the mid-aughts. Discogs is a fairly clunky, definitely old-fashioned website devoted to even older technology: a vestige of an earlier, more idyllic internet that has spent the last decade walking the record-needle-thin line between 2020s algorithmically driven tech monolith and niche unprofitable obscurity.\nA big part of its ability to walk that line is the passion of its user base. Sellers have to submit a record\u2019s information if it\u2019s not already in the database in order to sell it \u2014 that\u2019s how the database has become so complete. And many entries, even for deep obscurities, are fastidious: album covers and liner notes are scanned for inclusion and album credits are fleshed out with hyperlinks that are almost more useful and thorough than the Wikipedia equivalent, plus reviews by devotees. There is even a lively forum where all of these details get litigated. It is an insular community in many ways. But it is also, and has always been, a money-making endeavor for both Discogs and the sellers who use it.\nDiscogs is now the source of many people\u2019s full-time employment. A European Discogs seller, who has been on the platform since 2008 and requested anonymity for fear of retribution by the company, says he does 80 percent of his business on the platform. He does not operate a brick-and-mortar storefront but has four employees and nets around \u20ac20,000 a month on Discogs. According to him, his sales have shrunk by half over the past year, and he\u2019s in the process of building his own site to try to move away from the platform.\n\u201cI\u2019ve made my living with this company for the past decade,\u201d says a Connecticut seller who also does the majority of his business on Discogs and requested anonymity for the same reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s just the frustration that you have no control over what they\u2019re doing, and it doesn\u2019t even make any sense.\u201d The vinyl renaissance has occurred in tandem with the growth of Discogs, making the site fairly integrated into any record business \u2014 regardless of whether a business has a brick-and-mortar storefront. A major change to the site, then, could mean a major shift in the record market as a whole.\nUnderlying the sellers\u2019 complaints is a kind of dismay, the feeling that what had previously been a safe haven for nerds to buy and sell $2 records is being threatened \u2014 that one more corner of the internet that wasn\u2019t yet a glossy behemoth designed to subsume and capitalize on your personal information was about to collapse.\n\u201cWhen you get any kind of community built around a business, and you tweak that a little bit, you\u2019re gonna make a lot of people upset,\u201d says Martin. \u201cThis is their Discogs, they built it.\u201d\nThe problems started in earnest when the company raised its fee from 8 to 9 percent on May 22nd of this year, and \u2014 crucially \u2014 started charging that same fee on shipping costs for the first time, an issue considering how international the record market is. One of the beauties of Discogs had previously been finding and purchasing rarities from sellers in Japan or Germany; the most expensive record I\u2019ve ever purchased, for example, was a copy of Cannonball Adderley\u2019s debut album from a seller in Switzerland. Now, the site is taking considerably larger slices of those kinds of sales. (Discogs declined to comment for this story.)\nYou\u2019ll find details on just about every release of every album on Discogs. This entry for a Japanese pressing of Thelonious Monk in Italy includes photos of the record jacket and both sides of the vinyl.\nTo make up for the lost revenue, Discogs suggested sellers use a tool it had created to raise the prices of all of their inventory by a percentage; another Discogs email to sellers suggested they offer free shipping to avoid the fee, without accounting for the fact that the seller would then be either covering that cost out of pocket or integrating it into the price of the record \u2014 which would, of course, result in the same amount of money going to Discogs. Essentially, sellers were told to raise their prices and \/ or offer free shipping \u2014 two options that threaten their bottom lines. \u201cTheir communication, too \u2014 it\u2019s like, \u2018I said what I said, and we\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d says Martin. \u201cWell, you\u2019re really not, because we all have to live with this and so do you.\u201d\nThe tension between Discogs\u2019 old-internet charm and its attempts at growth came to a head earlier this summer around a since-deleted viral Twitter thread by artist and label head Mike Simonetti lamenting \u201cthe fall of discogs.\u201d Simonetti sounded the alarm about increasing fees and subsequently increasing prices, a growing influx of scammers, rising shipping costs, and the dysfunction of the website itself, among other issues.\n\u201cWe had kind of thought Discogs was on our side as sellers,\u201d says Gene Melkisethian, who runs Joint Custody, a record store in Washington, DC, and sells on Discogs. \u201cBut when they started charging fees on shipping, it just felt really punitive.\u201d\n\u201cIn their communication, it was beyond insulting the way they framed it. Like, \u2018Oh, you can just not charge for shipping,\u2019\u201d says the Connecticut seller. \u201cThe sudden fee increase was a huge, huge blow to a lot of people.\u201d\nThe fee increase arrived shortly before USPS raised the price of its Media Mail service (the lower rates at which anyone can send media products like books, music, and movies) by an average of 7 percent \u2014 and a year after the site had switched all its transactions to PayPal, which charges its own fees on each transaction, ones that are higher on international purchases. PayPal also requires that every shipment has a tracking number, which can be a significant extra expense for international sales.\nThe changes also arrived at the tail end of a phenomenon alluded to in the same original thread. The pandemic had created something of a record sales bubble: people who were already vinyl aficionados were stuck at home with their record players, stimulus checks, and nothing to spend them on besides survival and things you could do at home \u2014 like listen to music. Melkisethian says his sales actually grew during the pandemic in spite of the fact that his brick-and-mortar sales disappeared. According to him, the boom inflated record prices; now, with the higher fees Discogs is imposing, a sales decline that was almost inevitable post-lockdown has become steeper.\n\u201cThey\u2019re under the impression that they\u2019re the only game in town.\u201d\nEven with all of those increasing costs, Discogs is still less expensive (albeit now only slightly) than alternatives like eBay or Amazon. But those alternatives, being considerably larger and more mainstream, offer a much broader base of potential buyers as well as a more solid infrastructure and support system.\n\u201ceBay has much more of a user base, so for the little bit of extra cost it\u2019s a no brainer,\u201d says Martin, who says that, for him, eBay\u2019s fees are usually around 1 percent higher than Discogs\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s probably double [the business] I do on Discogs, and that\u2019s only grown since they raised the fees.\u201d He sells primarily new vinyl and uses Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and Discogs, along with his own website, apocalypsevinyl.com. With the new fees and the competitiveness of the Discogs market, the platform is becoming less and less useful as a selling channel.\n\u201cThey\u2019re under the impression that they\u2019re the only game in town,\u201d says the Connecticut seller of Discogs. \u201cThe fees were relatively low, but now that they\u2019re higher, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a reason to use that anymore.\u201d He\u2019s been selling on Discogs since 2009; since the recent changes, he\u2019s lowered his prices to offset the higher shipping costs and was compelled to institute an order minimum \u2014 a major shift for a marketplace that had done considerable business in selling records under $10 and even under $5.\nDiscogs attributed the need to raise fees to its \u201csignificant investments in recent years to ensure compliance with various regulatory programs, including tax support and privacy protection.\u201d The company said the change would allow it to \u201ccontinue to devote resources to maintaining the Discogs Marketplace and develop better tools for collecting, selling, and enjoying music.\u201d\nMany sellers who spoke with The Verge speculated, in line with the viral thread, that the company was trying to pump up its valuation for a potential sale. All of them, though, had the sense that Discogs was trying to increase its profit margins without necessarily offering any improvements to its product in return.\nDiscogs\u2019 marketplace page showing copies of Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Guts for sale. The prices are generally higher than buying the album elsewhere.\n\u201cIt just seems like they\u2019re actively trying to stop sales,\u201d says the Connecticut seller. \u201cYou can raise your fees, but maybe you could do some promotions, coupon codes, sales \u2014 something that offsets the shift. Sellers can do it on their own, but that\u2019s going to require them to lower their prices \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a race to the bottom. If you were trying to ruin a sales forum, this is how you\u2019d do it.\u201d\nDiscogs did have a sale in late August, but it featured just 11 of the site\u2019s largest stores. \u201cWhen I first saw it, I thought, maybe they\u2019ll be randomly promoting stores or the best products,\u201d says Martin. \u201cI don\u2019t know a big sale that most people are not part of that you promote to further depress our prices is the right direction.\u201d\nThe website itself is a frequent source of complaints, as is the lack of support. (My query for a press contact was sent on July 25th, for example; I received a response on August 23rd.) \u201cI guess the most apparent thing has been the lack of updates, or any positive progress in the operation of a website,\u201d says Melkisethian, who has been selling on Discogs since 2011. \u201cIt was a little bit quaint back then, but it has not improved in any way. It\u2019s actually only gotten worse, which is kind of funny \u2014 but knowing how much money I\u2019ve given them and other people give them, it\u2019s like, who\u2019s steering the ship?\u201d\nDiscogs is in the process of rolling out a redesign, one that \u2014 to look at the forums at least \u2014 doesn\u2019t have many fans among the Discogs lifers but is definitely sleeker-looking. According to the sellers who spoke with The Verge, bugs abound: the European seller, for example, had just been dealing with an issue with the platform\u2019s refund button. \u201cDiscogs said it was PayPal\u2019s fault, and PayPal said it was Discogs\u2019 fault,\u201d he says. \u201cIt caused stress for the buyers, and so I had to do direct refunds \u2014 which meant I was refunding not just what I made but Discogs\u2019 and PayPal\u2019s commissions as well, effectively losing money on the refund.\u201d Melkisethian, speaking a month later, had just noticed a shift in the way shipments are processed that required manually entering information in steps that used to be automated.\nBesides the baseline functionality of the site, there are other improvements that could bring Discogs closer in line with its competitors. \u201cThere are other seller tools and seller initiatives that we\u2019ve been asking for for years that have never been done \u2014 like any kind of tie-in with Google, any kind of integration with social media, the kinds of things basically other platform has,\u201d says Martin.\nThe database is another aspect of the site that could be threatened by the fee increases. If sellers and buyers move elsewhere, that database will likely become less exhaustive. \u201cEver since the price increases, I\u2019ve noticed that less and less new albums are being added to the database,\u201d says Martin. \u201cWhen we get new stock in, we have to match it up with a UPC on Discogs and we\u2019re noticing it\u2019s not there as often as it used to be.\u201d\nA beloved internet sanctuary gets bled for profit to the detriment of its functionality \u2014 by 2023, it\u2019s become just about the most familiar story online. Discogs, hopefully, will not become the latest in a long line of formerly useful sites; for the moment, though, sellers feel alienated by the small company they once viewed as an ally in an optimistic mission to share knowledge about music.\n\nThis article, authored by Natalie Weiner, was published by The Verge on 2023-10-07 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":96}
{"title":"Sen. Robert Menendez, facing bribery charges, stumps bank CEOs by asking how much their firms paid in settlements for allegedly ripping off consumers","context":"## Sen. Robert Menendez, facing bribery charges, stumps bank CEOs by asking how much their firms paid in settlements for allegedly ripping off consumers\n\nSen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), charged with bribery, gave Wall Street bank executives a pop quiz about their own corporate misbehavior that they all failed.\nOn Wednesday, at a congressional hearing, the embattled Menendez grilled Wall Street executives about how much money the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered each of their firms to pay back to consumers for allegedly violating federal laws including charging illegal junk fees and opening fake customer accounts. Through his questioning, the senator was attempting to show that, contrary to what the bank CEOs argued, new financial regulations do benefit everyday customers.\nMenendez directed his arrows at four retail bank CEOs\u2014all of whom were unable to respond. He started with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and moved down a long table asking Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, and Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharff how much each had \u201creturned to customers in the form of redresses and payments at the direction of CFPB?\u201d\nThough the executives didn\u2019t know the answer, the numbers are large, even for top Wall Street firms: $360 million for JPMorgan Chase, $819 million for Bank of America, $1 billion for Citigroup, and \u201cover $2 billion\u201d for Wells Fargo. All in all, it amounts to nearly $4 billion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing you don\u2019t know the number because they\u2019re not small in nature,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cIt\u2019s over $4 billion returned to hardworking consumers in the past dozen years.\u201d\nMenendez\u2019s own adherence to the law happens to also be in question. In September, the Justice Department charged him and his wife Nadine with accepting bribes and allegedly using his Senate seat to improperly aid the Egyptian government. A raid of Menendez\u2019s house turned up $100,000 in gold bars and bundles of cash stuffed into jacket pockets. Menendez pleaded not guilty.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is facing legal challenges of its own. The watchdog, created in 2011 in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis, is facing a Supreme Court case that could determine its future. The Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade organization that represents payday lenders, alleges the CFPB is unconstitutional because it is not subject to annual appropriations from Congress.\n\u201cThe lawsuit currently before the Supreme Court over the CFPB\u2019s funding structure has the potential to upend every rule, guidance and order the CFPB has ever issued, tossing over a decade of consumer protection law out of the window,\u201d Menendez said during the hearing to defend the CFPB. \u201cThat\u2019s not just harmful for consumers. I think it\u2019s dangerous to the financial system.\u201d\nThe annual Senate hearing featured eight executives, including the four Menendez questioned, from the biggest financial institutions. Executives and legislators discussed new regulations that would require the big banks to keep larger capital reserves. The big banks argued the new rules would limit their ability to lend to lower and middle income buyers. In contrast, committee chair Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) disagreed and said any reduced lending would be due to banks prioritizing riskier investments that have higher returns.\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather fund risky trading and derivatives bets than boring bread and butter small business lending,\u201d Brown said in his opening remarks.\nThe indicted Menendez also framed some of the banks\u2019 unpopular practices, like overdraft fees, as a decision rather than a necessity.\n\u201cCharging the fees is a choice\u2014one that disproportionately harms Black and brown communities, Menendez said. Getting rid of overdraft fees would \u201cchange the course of events for a significant part of [your] consumer base.\u201d\nResearch points to the fact that overdraft fees disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic customers. A 2021 study found that Hispanic Americans paid $3.1 billion in overdraft fees a year Black Americans were hit with $1.4 billion in total. Another survey found they paid double the amount of fees than White people did.\nMenendez commended Citibank\u2019s Fraser for her company eliminating such fees in 2022 after government officials urged an end to the practice. Big banks like Citi also face competitive pressures from fintech startups and smaller banks, like Ally Bank, that offer bank accounts without overdraft fees.\n\u201cIs it fair to say that Citi is still a profitable bank?\u201d Menendez asked Fraser.\n\u201cYes, Senator,\u201d Fraser replied.\nMenendez pressed her further, asking if their elimination led to wholesale changes at the bank.\n\u201cDid [removing] overdraft fees upend your business model,\u201d Menendez continued.\n\u201cNo, Senator,\u201d Fraser answered. \u201cWe work hard to protect our customers and make sure that they don\u2019t fall into overdraft.\u201d\nMenendez used this line of questioning to encourage Scharff, Dimon, and Moynihan to learn from Fraser and Citigroup. \u201cI suggest you call Mr. Fraser after this hearing to figure out how you can still be able to eliminate the fees in their entirety and still run a profitable bank,\u201d Menendez urged Scharff, Moynihan, and Dimon.\nThe other banks have made some steps to ease overdraft fees but haven\u2019t done away with them completely. In 2021, JPMorgan Chase eliminated fees for overdrafts that were under $50. The new policy still led to an increase in revenue from overdraft fees, which rose 3% in 2022, a year after the policy was implemented, according to Bloomberg. Wells Fargo also loosened its rules without getting rid of the fees entirely, affording customers a 24-hour grace period to pay back any overdrafted accounts. Meanwhile, Bank of America cut its overdraft fees from $35 to $10.\n\nThis article, authored by Paolo Confino, was published by Fortune on 2023-12-06 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":97}
{"title":"Biden\u2019s AI EO hailed as broad, but not deep without legislation to match","context":"## Biden\u2019s AI EO hailed as broad, but not deep without legislation to match\n\nThe Biden administration announced the details of a long-awaited executive order on AI today, ahead of an international summit on AI safety being held in the U.K. But as with all such orders, what the president can dictate without legislative support is limited, as numerous experts and stakeholders emphasized in response.\nThe order comes as governments across the globe continue their attempts to address the opportunities and risks of AI, which has so far proved too fast a moving target for regulators. Facing twin risks of premature action chilling innovation and dilatory action permitting abuse or exploitation, the U.S. and EU have avoided the first but due to lengthy argument and drafting processes are rolling headlong toward the second.\nBiden\u2019s EO operates as a stopgap that props up the \u201cvoluntary\u201d practices many companies are already choosing to implement. The limits on what a president can do with a wave of their hand means it\u2019s a lot of sharing results, developing best practices and providing clear guidance.\nThat\u2019s because right now there is no legislative remedy to potential AI risks and abuses outside of those that can be applied to tech companies in general \u2014 which many have argued over the years are also inadequate. Federal action on social media and de facto monopolies like Amazon and Google has been sporadic, though a hawkish new FTC may change that trend.\nMeanwhile, a comprehensive law defining and limiting the use of AI seems as far off now as it was years ago. The industry and technology have evolved so quickly that any rule would likely be outdated by the time it was passed. It\u2019s not even really clear what ought to be legislatively limited, as opposed to being left to state law or expert agencies.\nPerhaps the wisest approach is to set up a new federal agency dedicated to regulating AI and technology, but this cannot be accomplished by fiat. In the meantime, the EO at least instructs several AI-focused groups, like one in the Department of Health and Human Services dedicated to handling and assessing reports of AI-related harms in healthcare.\nSenator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was \u201cimpressed by the breadth\u201d of the order, though, he implies, not the depth.\n\u201cI am also happy to see a number of sections that closely align with my efforts around AI safety and security and federal government\u2019s use of AI,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, many of these just scratch the surface \u2013 particularly in areas like health care and competition policy. While this is a good step forward, we need additional legislative measures, and I will continue to work diligently\u2026\u201d etc.\nGiven the state of the legislature and the fact that an incredibly contentious election period is upcoming, it will be a miracle if any substantive law whatsoever is passed in the near future, let alone a potentially divisive and complex bill like AI rules.\nPaul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, acknowledged both sides of the issue.\n\u201cPresident Biden is sending a valuable message that certain AI systems create immediate risks that demand immediate attention. The administration is moving in the right direction,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut today is just the beginning of a regulatory process that will be long and arduous\u2013and ultimately must require that the companies profiting from AI bear the burden of proving that their products are safe and effective, just as the manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or industrial chemicals or airplanes must demonstrate that their products are safe and effective. Without fresh resources provided by Congress, it\u2019s not clear that the federal government has the resources to assess the vastly complicated training process or the adequacy of red-teaming and other necessary testing.\u201d\nSheila Gulati, co-founder of Tola Capital, said the EO showed a \u201cclear intention to walk the line of promoting innovation while protecting citizens.\u201d\n\u201cIt is most essential that we don\u2019t prevent agile innovation by startups. Putting AI explainability at the forefront, taking a risk-based approach with more focus on areas where harm or bias could be at play, and bringing security and privacy to the center of focus are all sensible steps,\u201d she told TechCrunch. \u201cWith this executive order and the standards implications through NIST, we would anticipate leadership from standards bodies versus legislators in the near term.\u201d\nIt is worth mentioning as well that the federal government is a major customer of today\u2019s AI and tech products, and any company that intends to keep them as a customer will want to color inside the lines for the immediate future.\nBob Cattanach, partner at legal mega-firm Dorsey and Whitney, added that the timing feels slightly off.\n\u201c\u2026The Executive Order awkwardly preempts the voice of Vice President Harris at a U.K.-hosted Summit on AI later this week, signaling that White House concerns over the largely unregulated space were so grave that Biden was prepared to alienate key allies by taking unilateral action rather than accept the delays inherent in the more collaborative process currently underway in the EU.\u201d\nAlienate is perhaps a strong word for it. And of course, the U.K. is not the EU. And that \u201cmore collaborative process\u201d will likely take a few more years, and it\u2019s unlikely the administration wants to wait until then. But it might indeed have been more coherent and ally-like to have Harris discuss the EO at the summit. Her remarks (which will no doubt suggest the need for international harmony in AI regulation, with the U.S. modestly taking the lead) will be streamed on November 1, and you should be able to tune in here.\n\nThis article, authored by Devin Coldewey, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-31 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":98}
{"title":"How OpenAI's ChatGPT has changed the world in just a year","context":"## How OpenAI's ChatGPT has changed the world in just a year\n\nOver the course of two months from its debut in November 2022, ChatGPT exploded in popularity, from niche online curio to 100 million monthly active users \u2014 the fastest user base growth in the history of the Internet. In less than a year, it has earned the backing of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest firms, and been shoehorned into myriad applications from academia and the arts to marketing, medicine, gaming and government.\nIn short ChatGPT is just about everywhere. Few industries have remained untouched by the viral adoption of the generative AI\u2019s tools. On the first anniversary of its release, let\u2019s take a look back on the year of ChatGPT that brought us here.\nOpenAI had been developing GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), the large language model that ChatGPT runs on, since 2016 \u2014 unveiling GPT-1 in 2018 and iterating it to GPT-3 by June 2020. With the November 30, 2022 release of GPT-3.5 came ChatGPT, a digital agent capable of superficially understanding natural language inputs and generating written responses to them. Sure, it was rather slow to answer and couldn\u2019t speak to questions about anything that happened after September 2021 \u2014 not to mention its issues answering queries with misinformation during bouts of \u201challucinations\" \u2014 but even that kludgy first iteration demonstrated capabilities far beyond what other state-of-the-art digital assistants like Siri and Alexa could provide.\nChatGPT\u2019s release timing couldn\u2019t have been better. The public had already been introduced to the concept of generative artificial intelligence in April of that year with DALL-E 2, a text-to-image generator. DALL-E 2, as well as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and similar programs, were an ideal low-barrier entry point for the general public to try out this revolutionary new technology. They were an immediate smash hit, with Subreddits and Twitter accounts springing up seemingly overnight to post screengrabs of the most outlandish scenarios users could imagine. And it wasn\u2019t just the terminally online that embraced AI image generation, the technology immediately entered the mainstream discourse as well, extraneous digits and all.\nSo when ChatGPT dropped last November, the public was already primed on the idea of having computers make content at a user\u2019s direction. The logical leap from having it make words instead of pictures wasn\u2019t a large one \u2014 heck, people had already been using similar, inferior versions in their phones for years with their digital assistants.\nQ1: [Hyping intensifies]\nTo say that ChatGPT was well-received would be to say that the Titanic suffered a small fender-bender on its maiden voyage. It was a polestar, magnitudes bigger than the hype surrounding DALL-E and other image generators. People flat out lost their minds over the new AI and its CEO, Sam Altman. Throughout December 2022, ChatGPT\u2019s usage numbers rose meteorically as more and more people logged on to try it for themselves.\nBy the following January, ChatGPT was a certified phenomenon, surpassing 100 million monthly active users in just two months. That was faster than both TikTok or Instagram, and remains the fastest user adoption to 100 million in the history of the internet.\nWe also got our first look at the disruptive potential that generative AI offers when ChatGPT managed to pass a series of law school exams (albeit by the skin of its digital teeth). Around that time Microsoft extended its existing R&D partnership with OpenAI to the tune of $10 billion that January. That number is impressively large and likely why Altman still has his job.\nAs February rolled around, ChatGPT\u2019s user numbers continued to soar, surpassing one billion users total with an average of more than 35 million people per day using the program. At this point OpenAI was reportedly worth just under $30 billion and Microsoft was doing its absolute best to cram the new technology into every single system, application and feature in its product ecosystem. ChatGPT was incorporated into BingChat (now just Copilot) and the Edge browser to great fanfare \u2014 despite repeated incidents of bizarre behavior and responses that saw the Bing program temporarily taken offline for repairs.\nOther tech companies began adopting ChatGPT as well: Opera incorporating it into its browser, Snapchat releasing its GPT-based My AI assistant (which would be unceremoniously abandoned a few problematic months later) and Buzzfeed News\u2019s parent company used it to generate listicles.\nMarch saw more of the same, with OpenAI announcing a new subscription-based service \u2014 ChatGPT Plus \u2014 which offers users the chance to skip to the head of the queue during peak usage hours and added features not found in the free version. The company also unveiled plug-in and API support for the GPT platform, empowering developers to add the technology to their own applications and enabling ChatGPT to pull information from across the internet as well as interact directly with connected sensors and devices.\nChatGPT also notched 100 million users per day in March, 30 times higher than two months prior. Companies from Slack and Discord to GM announced plans to incorporate GPT and generative AI technologies into their products.\nNot everybody was quite so enthusiastic about the pace at which generative AI was being adopted, mind you. In March, OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk, as well as Steve Wozniak and a slew of associated AI researchers signed an open letter demanding a six month moratorium on AI development.\nQ2: Electric Boog-AI-loo\nOver the next couple months, company fell into a rhythm of continuous user growth, new integrations, occasional rival AI debuts and nationwide bans on generative AI technology. For example, in April, ChatGPT\u2019s usage climbed nearly 13 percent month-over-month from March even as the entire nation of Italy outlawed ChatGPT use by public sector employees, citing GDPR data privacy violations. The Italian ban proved only temporary after the company worked to resolve the flagged issues, but it was an embarrassing rebuke for the company and helped spur further calls for federal regulation.\nWhen it was first released, ChatGPT was only available through a desktop browser. That changed in May when OpenAI released its dedicated iOS app and expanded the digital assistant\u2019s availability to an additional 11 countries including France, Germany, Ireland and Jamaica. At the same time, Microsoft\u2019s integration efforts continued apace, with Bing Search melding into the chatbot as its \u201cdefault search experience.\u201d OpenAI also expanded ChatGPT\u2019s plug-in system to ensure that more third-party developers are able to build ChatGPT into their own products.\nChatGPT\u2019s tendency to hallucinate facts and figures was once again exposed that month when a lawyer in New York was caught using the generative AI to do \u201clegal research.\u201d It gave him a number of entirely made-up, nonexistent cases to cite in his argument \u2014 which he then did without bothering to independently validate any of them. The judge was not amused.\nBy June, a little bit of ChatGPT\u2019s shine had started to wear off. Congress reportedly limited Capitol Hill staffers from using the application over data handling concerns. User numbers had declined nearly 10 percent month-over-month, but ChatGPT was already well on its way to ubiquity. A March update enabling the AI to comprehend and generate Python code in response to natural language queries only increased its utility.\nQ3: [Pushback intensifies]\nMore cracks in ChatGPT\u2019s facade began to show the following month when OpenAI\u2019s head of Trust and Safety, Dave Willner, abruptly announced his resignation days before the company released its ChatGPT Android app. His departure came on the heels of news of an FTC investigation into the company\u2019s potential violation of consumer protection laws \u2014 specifically regarding the user data leak from March that inadvertently shared chat histories and payment records.\nIt was around this time that OpenAI\u2019s training methods, which involve scraping the public internet for content and feeding it into massive datasets on which the models are taught, came under fire from copyright holders and marquee authors alike. Much in the same manner that Getty Images sued Stability AI for Stable Diffusion\u2019s obvious leverage of copyrighted materials, stand-up comedian and author Sara Silverman brought suit against OpenAI with allegations that its \u201cBook2\u201d dataset illegally included her copyrighted works. The Authors Guild of America, which represents Stephen King, John Grisham and 134 others launched a class-action suit of its own in September. While much of Silverman\u2019s suit was eventually dismissed, the Author\u2019s Guild suit continues to wend its way through the courts.\nSelect news outlets, on the other hand, proved far more amenable. The Associated Press announced in August that it had entered into a licensing agreement with OpenAI which would see AP content used (with permission) to train GPT models. At the same time, the AP unveiled a new set of newsroom guidelines explaining how generative AI might be used in articles, while still cautioning journalists against using it for anything that might actually be published.\nChatGPT itself didn\u2019t seem too inclined to follow the rules. In a report published in August, the Washington Post found that guardrails supposedly enacted by OpenAI in March, designed to counter the chatbot\u2019s use in generating and amplifying political disinformation, actually weren\u2019t. The company told Semafor in April that it was \"developing a machine learning classifier that will flag when ChatGPT is asked to generate large volumes of text that appear related to electoral campaigns or lobbying.\" Per the Post, those rules simply were not enforced, with the system eagerly returning responses for prompts like \u201cWrite a message encouraging suburban women in their 40s to vote for Trump\u201d or \u201cMake a case to convince an urban dweller in their 20s to vote for Biden.\u201d\nAt the same time, OpenAI was rolling out another batch of new features and updates for ChatGPT including an Enterprise version that could be fine-tuned to a company\u2019s specific needs and trained on the firm\u2019s internal data, allowing the chatbot to provide more accurate responses. Additionally, ChatGPT\u2019s ability to browse the internet for information was restored for Plus users in September, having been temporarily suspended earlier in the year after folks figured out how to exploit it to get around paywalls. OpenAI also expanded the chatbot\u2019s multimodal capabilities, adding support for both voice and image inputs for user queries in a September 25 update.\nQ4: Starring Sam Altman as \u201cLazarus\u201d\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 has been a hell of a decade for OpenAI. On the technological front, Browse with Bing, Microsoft\u2019s answer to Google SGE, moved out of beta and became available to all subscribers \u2014 just in time for the third iteration of DALL-E to enter public beta. Even free tier users can now hold spoken conversations with the chatbot following the November update, a feature formerly reserved for Plus and Enterprise subscribers. What\u2019s more, OpenAI has announced GPTs, little single-serving versions of the larger LLM that function like apps and widgets and which can be created by anyone, regardless of their programming skill level.\nThe company has also suggested that it might be entering the AI chip market at some point in the future, in an effort to shore up the speed and performance of its API services. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously pointed to industry-wide GPU shortages for the service\u2019s spotty performance. Producing its own processors might mitigate those supply issues, while potentially lower the current four-cent-per-query cost of operating the chatbot to something more manageable.\nBut even those best laid plans were very nearly smashed to pieces just before Thanksgiving when the OpenAI board of directors fired Sam Altman, arguing that he had not been \"consistently candid in his communications with the board.\"\nThat firing didn't take. Instead, it set off 72 hours of chaos within the company itself and the larger industry, with waves of recriminations and accusations, threats of resignations by a lion\u2019s share of the staff and actual resignations by senior leadership happening by the hour. The company went through three CEOs in as many days, landing back on the one it started with, albeit with him now free from a board of directors that would even consider acting as a brake against the technology\u2019s further, unfettered commercial development.\nAt the start of the year, ChatGPT was regularly derided as a fad, a gimmick, some shiny bauble that would quickly be cast aside by a fickle public like so many NFTs. Those predictions could still prove true but as 2023 has ground on and the breadth of ChatGPT\u2019s adoption has continued, the chances of those dim predictions of the technology\u2019s future coming to pass feel increasingly remote.\nThere is simply too much money wrapped up in ensuring its continued development, from the revenue streams of companies promoting the technology to the investments of firms incorporating the technology into their products and services. There is also a fear of missing out among companies, S&P Global argues \u2014 that they might adopt too late what turns out to be a foundationally transformative technology \u2014 that is helping drive ChatGPT\u2019s rapid uptake.\nThe calendar resetting for the new year shouldn\u2019t do much to change ChatGPT\u2019s upward trajectory, but looming regulatory oversight might. President Biden has made the responsible development of AI a focus of his administration, with both houses of Congress beginning to draft legislation as well. The form and scope of those resulting rules could have a significant impact on what ChatGPT looks like this time next year.\nThis article contains affilate links; if you click such a link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission.\n\nThis article, authored by Andrew Tarantola, was published by Engadget on 2023-11-30 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":99}

Today, the EFL is comprised of the second-tier Championship, third-tier League One, and fourth-tier League Two. But Premier League clubs are still invited to participate in the League Cup (EFL Cup) every season.\nBeginning in the 1990s, corporations began paying to attach their name to this tournament and the sponsor names caught on for brief periods when it was known as the Coca-Cola Cup, the Worthington's Cup, and the Carling Cup.\nThe latest sponsor is Thai energy drink company Carabao, which bought the title rights of the knockout tournament beginning with the 2017\/18 edition, leading to the use of the Carabao Cup moniker that is popularly used today.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Bonn, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-19 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":100}
{"title":"Chelsea secure last-eight spot after Raheem Sterling sinks Blackburn","context":"## Chelsea secure last-eight spot after Raheem Sterling sinks Blackburn\n\nIt is no wonder Mauricio Pochettino spends most of his time watching Chelsea on the edge of the touchline with his hands clasped tightly in his pockets and a tense expression on his face.\nEven with his side 2-0 up and cruising against Blackburn thanks to goals from Beno\u00eet Badiashile and a rejuvenated Raheem Sterling, the Chelsea manager was a bundle of nerves throughout what turned out to be a comfortable victory in the end.\nBut while the lack of cutting edge that has become a hallmark of the Todd Boehly-era in west London still looms large as he prepares for his first return to table-topping Tottenham on Monday night, Pochettino could take heart from Cole Palmer\u2019s brilliant performance as the former Manchester City forward helped to dispatch Jon Dahl Tomasson\u2019s inexperienced side.\nHaving played his part in Badiashile\u2019s opening goal in the defender\u2019s first appearance of the season with a cheeky nutmeg to combine with Conor Gallagher from a quickly-taken corner, Palmer was also involved in Sterling\u2019s goal that sealed this victory in the second half.\nQuick Guide Carabao Cup quarter-final draw Show Newcastle will travel to Chelsea in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup after knocking out both Manchester clubs. Eddie Howe's side followed up their victory over City with a 3-0 win over United at Old Trafford with goals from Miguel Almir\u00f3n, Lewis Hall and Joe Willock. The Magpies will now face five-times winners Chelsea, who beat Championship Blackburn thanks to goals from Beno\u00eet Badiashile and Raheem Sterling at Stamford Bridge. West Ham's reward for a 3-1 victory over Arsenal is a trip to Anfield to take on Liverpool, who edged out Bournemouth 2-1 thanks to Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez's superb winner, while Everton will play Fulham. There will be a team from the English Football League in the semi-finals with League One Port Vale hosting Championship Middlesbrough. PA Media\nDraw Everton v Fulham; Chelsea v Newcastle; Port Vale v Middlesbrough; Liverpool v West Ham. Ties to be played week commencing 18 December. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\nReece James was also a constant menace to Blackburn\u2019s defence as he started for the first time since the opening day of the season on his return from injury and Pochettino admitted he is delighted to have his captain back.\n\u201cHe is one of the best full-backs in the world and to have been without him for so long has been difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need to be careful and little by little he will get back to full fitness.\u201d\nBlackburn\u2019s fortunes since Andy Cole scored the winning goal that saw off Tottenham in the final of this competition more than 20 years ago under Graeme Souness have seen the Lancashire club drop down to the third tier for a season before coming close to reaching the Championship playoffs in the past two campaigns.\nThey currently find themselves 12th after an inconsistent start but Tomasson opted against sending out his first-choice team despite Chelsea\u2019s recent vulnerabilities at home, with the 26-year-old captain Lewis Travis the oldest player he selected.\nBeno\u00eet Badiashile opens the scoring for Chelsea from close range in the first half. Photograph: Javier Garc\u00eda\/Shutterstock\n\u201cIt was the millionaires of the Premier League against the youngsters of the Championship,\u201d reflected the former Denmark forward. \u201cWe should be proud of this performance.\u201d\nBlackburn certainly managed to cause problems for Chelsea even after the hosts made their intentions clear straight from the kick-off when Nicolas Jackson forced a corner when his shot was blocked. Travis was very lucky not to concede a penalty when he slid in against Sterling after 10 minutes, with no VAR to overrule what looked like a clear and obvious error from the referee Tim Robinson.\nIt took a good save from Leopold Wahlstedt to deny James but Blackburn then enjoyed a good period of possession in their opponents\u2019 half. James was inches away from breaking the deadlock midway through the first half but his shot just eluded the far post before Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez forced Wahlstedt to palm away his effort soon afterwards.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not for the first time, Robert S\u00e1nchez was then far too casual as the Chelsea goalkeeper\u2019s pass was almost intercepted.\nAlmost 15 minutes had passed by the time Fern\u00e1ndez had Chelsea\u2019s first effort of the second half. Palmer came closer from a tight angle but, having cleared the ensuing corner, Blackburn shot themselves in the foot as they tried to play out. Brittain\u2019s pass was intercepted by Palmer and Sterling curled home from the edge of the area to give Pochettino some welcome breathing space. Jackson should have made it even more comfortable but blazed over from close range before the post denied the outstanding Palmer a goal with a deflected shot.\nSterling could and probably should have added to his tally after finding space in behind Blackburn\u2019s defence on more than one occasion in the closing stages. But it was Palmer who was afforded a standing ovation when he was withdrawn at the end as Chelsea\u2019s supporters celebrated only their fourth home win of the season \u2013 three of them in this competition.\n\nThis article, authored by Ed Aarons at Stamford Bridge, was published by The Guardian on 2023-11-01 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":101}
{"title":"He\u2019s Hockey\u2019s Brightest Young Star. This Is What Makes His Shot So Special.","context":"## He\u2019s Hockey\u2019s Brightest Young Star. This Is What Makes His Shot So Special.\n\nWhat is it, really, about Connor Bedard\u2019s shot \u2014 a shot that, though he\u2019s just 18 years old, has for years been talked about as if he has patented it \u2014 that makes it so dangerous and unique?\nWhat\u2019s the nerdy science of it, from his feet up to his knees, hips, hands and head? How does he prep, shape and let it go? What does it look like to goalies, and to professional shooting coaches, those who\u2019ve taught him \u2014 or, more accurately, watched him after he taught himself \u2014 and had to stop him? The Athletic spoke with five NHL shooting and skills coaches, his teammates, past opponents and him to try to take apart, piece by piece, \u201cThe Bedard.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nTheir intel and stories help frame the NHL\u2019s brightest young star\u2019s signature skill.\nIf there\u2019s one thing Tim Turk knows, it\u2019s shooting. A self-described \u201cshooting and scoring coach,\u201d Turk has more than two decades of experience working with NHL stars, national federations and half a dozen NHL teams.\nTurk had no idea who Bedard was when he fielded a call from agent Greg Landry of Newport Sports asking him what he was doing tomorrow.\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m booked up a year in advance.\u201d\n\u201cWe have these two players coming in from out west and we want you to see them,\u201d Landry said.\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m booked up,\u201d Turk said again.\n\u201cYou have to see them,\u201d Landry insisted.\nAfter moving around his schedule, Turk found himself at Gary Roberts\u2019 personal rink in Uxbridge, Ontario.\n\u201cHey guys, I\u2019m Tim Turk,\u201d he said as he stepped into the small locker room.\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Nate,\u201d said the redhead, extending a hand.\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Connor,\u201d said the other, standing shorter and extending his.\n\u201cAll right, well we\u2019re just going to go out and I\u2019m going to do an evaluation on you and do some shooting and have some fun, and I\u2019ll make suggestions but I\u2019m not here to change anything,\u201d Turk said, giving the two boys his usual spiel and thinking nothing of it.\nThat evaluation is what he calls an \u201cNHL protocol observation assessment,\u201d which runs new clients through specific drills that allow him to visualize their shooting actions from a technical standpoint (he calls each player\u2019s shot \u201clike a fingerprint\u201d).\nThat starts with Turk throwing some pucks down in the slot and simply asking them to shoot them stationary so he can watch their body formation, hip and shoulder positions, spine angles and puck preparation and positioning, paying particular attention to where the puck starts in their stance versus where it finishes.\nAdvertisement\nOn that day, Nate (Danielson, the Red Wings\u2019 2023 No. 9 pick) went first, and Turk could tell he was a talented and hard-working player with a good shot and real promise.\nThen, on Connor\u2019s turn, Turk placed him in a position and watched how he got the puck ready to shoot. Only Connor didn\u2019t stickhandle and prepare for the shot, he just took the puck and shot it right away.\nAfter watching him run through the same number of shots as Nate did, Turk spoke for the first time.\n\u201cTimeout one second, just give me a second here, I\u2019m just trying to see what you\u2019re doing so I\u2019m going to have you take an extra few shots so that I can analyze where the puck\u2019s starting and where it\u2019s finishing,\u201d he said.\nAnother round later, he knew that this Connor kid, whose last name he still didn\u2019t know and who was then 16, was very different from even his high-end peers simply by his proficiency in shooting from a \u201cfrontal position.\u201d\nWhile almost all players point their toes at the net, set the puck at a right angle, load their shot and \u201cdrag it in and then snap it off,\u201d Turk says, on a line of 40 to 50 degrees behind their body or at least level with their heels, Bedard brought the puck in \u201ccompletely lateral.\u201d\nInstead of drawing the puck in at a 45-degree angle, he drew it at 180 degrees \u201cright across to the plane of his spine.\u201d Sometimes it even came in at a negative angle. It also happened in a smaller space than it does for other shooters. That lateral inward pull was \u201ccondensed \u2014 it\u2019s compacted.\u201d\nTurk says that Vladimir Tarasenko, whom Turk calls one of the NHL\u2019s quickest shooters, takes 18 inches to pull the puck in. Bedard did it all in 12 square inches \u2014 a one-foot box.\nTurk\u2019s reaction?\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI was like holy f\u2014,\u201d he said, spelling out the whole profanity, \u201cbecause the only other person that I know who does it quite like that is No. 34 in Toronto (Auston Matthews), and he still doesn\u2019t bring it in as lateral as Bedzy does.\u201d\nAfter the stationary shooting, they got into some motion drills.\nEvery time Turk introduced a new formation and shot type for Bedard, his application was \u201csimplistic, and he made it look easy.\u201d\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Tim Turk Hockey (@timturkhockey)\nWhen it was over, both kids said, \u201cThis was fun, thanks coach Turky,\u201d and Turk got in his car and drove home.\nThe next day, he got another call from Landry asking him what he was doing Thursday because the two boys had asked if they could have him back for another session.\n\u201cWell who the f\u2014 are these guys?\u201d Turk finally asked him.\n\u201cTurky, it\u2019s Connor Bedard,\u201d Landry said.\n\u201cWho\u2019s Connor Bedard?\u201d Turk asked.\nAfter the second session that same week, Turk didn\u2019t work with Bedard again until a stick manufacturer tried to pitch Bedard, who asked if Turk could be there when he test-drove the sticks.\nBy then, Turk knew the Bedard name and came away from another session with another takeaway, picking up on Bedard\u2019s eye contact and ability to change his mind mid-shot.\n\u201cWhat makes him unique is that he can be selective with it,\u201d Turk said.\nWhen he looks back on that first blind introduction, Turk laughs.\n\u201cYou know, most, when you\u2019re in a non-pressure, non-stressful situation, you\u2019ll play around with the puck a lot and then you\u2019ll take your shot because I\u2019m telling them to take their time,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, when he takes a shot, it looks like he just bends down, picks it up with his hand and places it where he wants to.\n\u201cHe believes that \u2018Hey, f\u2014 it, the puck is only two and a half inches wide, I can put it wherever I want.'\u201d\nToday, Turk would take Bedard\u2019s shot against anyone\u2019s.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cOn a shot release basis only, if I had to bet on who could get the puck off the quickest, with the most deception, with optimal speed, power and accuracy based on a starting point to a finishing point, I\u2019m picking Connor Bedard over Auston Matthews,\u201d Turk said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not taking anything away from Auston. It\u2019s just a little bit different because one\u2019s a righty, one\u2019s a lefty and one\u2019s got a little bit of a higher-angle pull-in change.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s one thing Nick Quinn wants people to know about \u201cThe Bedard,\u201d it\u2019s that it isn\u2019t just some natural gift.\n\u201cI can tell you firsthand it didn\u2019t happen by accident. Connor\u2019s worked on this since he was little,\u201d said Quinn, an NHL skills coach who has worked with Bedard each summer for several years.\nIf there\u2019s another, it\u2019s how hard Bedard\u2019s shot is to defend because he doesn\u2019t show you he\u2019s preparing for it.\n\u201cAs replicated in so many other areas of Connor\u2019s game, it\u2019s the deception and elite multi-tasking that catches opponents off guard,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cConnor\u2019s ability to create deception and change the shot angle at top speed is like very few I\u2019ve ever seen. The multi-tasking involved with attempting these shots at top speed is far beyond most player\u2019s capabilities.\u201d\nAnother shooting coach, who requested anonymity for this story because he works for another NHL club, pointed to Bedard\u2019s hands and legs.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting is how high and left he can get his top hand,\u201d the coach said. \u201cSo many players pull the puck in but can\u2019t get the puck to release from under their body. His footwork is so underrated in that aspect. If you watch his front leg, at times it\u2019s literally in the air at release \u2014 most have their back leg in the air at release. When he transfers his weight, he actually clears space for his hands to get tighter because he\u2019s not afraid to actually lunge into the shot.\u201d\nA fourth shooting coach, who hasn\u2019t worked with Bedard and also requested anonymity because he works for another NHL club, expressed a little more hesitancy.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m in the minority I\u2019m sure, but I am very curious to see how well his trademark shooting style works at this level,\u201d the coach said. \u201cHe really likes to pull pucks right into his feet. I really like his mechanics with his hands off his body and whippy stick \u2014 but I feel this habit makes it easier for elite level \u2018D\u2019 to get stick on puck or in the lanes to block shots. Finding space and time to let that shot go and get clean looks, I think, will be an adjustment.\u201d\nFor goalies, it\u2019s the angle change that gets them.\nMoose Jaw Warriors goalie Jackson Unger, whom Bedard scored on last year, said the toe-drag release, in particular, is a challenge.\n\u201cHe changes the angle so quickly that, as a goalie, you have to adjust to it, but when he does it so fast, it\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d Unger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of different angles he can give you.\u201d\nSabres first-round pick Zach Benson, who has played on teams with and against Bedard and skates with him in the summers, says it\u2019s Bedard\u2019s ability to set up the shot with his agility pre-shot that stands out to him.\n\u201cHe can move left to right like no one I\u2019ve seen before,\u201d Benson said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just trying to get out, face him, and hope it hits ya,\u201d said Scott Ratzlaff, Seattle Thunderbirds goalie and Buffalo Sabres prospect, with a smile. \u201cHe can shoot from anywhere and he\u2019s lethal from anywhere. You\u2019ve just always got to be ready just in case he shoots it. And then he\u2019s got a really good toe drag release, so it\u2019s watching for that and making sure you\u2019re lined up.\u201d\nA number of Chicago Blackhawks over the last few decades liked to put in extra time shooting. Patrick Kane would stay out with the young guys, including Alex DeBrincat, well after practice to play shooting games. But even they had a limit.\nBedard doesn\u2019t have much of a limit. It\u2019s common for him to be on the ice an hour after practice taking shots from all over the ice. He even got a few other rookies, especially defenseman Kevin Korchinski, to join him on a regular basis. As the media waits for Bedard at his dressing room stall for interviews, he shoots and shoots and shoots.\nAdvertisement\nBlackhawks coach Luke Richardson has been around long enough to see that in a few other special players.\n\u201cI know Jaromir Jagr did this for a long time,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cEven at the end of his career \u2014 and he skated around and he had the weights around the bottom of his ankles, practiced full practices like that. It\u2019s happened. That\u2019s their life. They love it so much and they have to be out there. That\u2019s where they feel comfortable and don\u2019t get tired. Hopefully, they go home and have a nap in the afternoon and not watch \u2018Young and the Restless.\u2019 Take it easy and get ready for the next day. It does add up when you put the hours of the week in.\u201d\nBedard has downplayed his lengthy post-practice sessions. To him, it\u2019s not like he has weights on his ankles. He\u2019s just shooting, nothing too strenuous.\nFor someone who shoots as much as Bedard does, you\u2019d think he would gladly accept being called a shooter. He doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cI say it a lot: I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a shooter,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make the right play. If the shot\u2019s there, I\u2019ll take it. Obviously, the goalies are good, you got to hit your spot.\u201d\nBlackhawks goalie Arvid S\u00f6derblom would certainly call Bedard a shooter. S\u00f6derblom and Petr Mrazek have faced more shots from Bedard than any NHL goalies this season. The challenge for them is that Bedard doesn\u2019t just shoot one way. He\u2019s unpredictable.\n\u201cWhen you have that type of shot, quick release, moves his body and shifts angles on the puck, it makes it harder on the goalies,\u201d S\u00f6derblom said. \u201cYou just saw the two goals (on Sunday against the Florida Panthers), both were quick releases. He finds that open net. He\u2019s a pure goal scorer. It\u2019s fun to have on the team and face him every day and see him take steps, too.\u201d\nWhile goalies are trying to figure out Bedard, he\u2019s been putting in the time to do the same with them. For one, he learned to utilize his teammates more. He accumulated plenty of shots on net early in the season, but they were often from distance and more individualistic chances. Then, he scored his first NHL goal on a wraparound and his next three goals off passes from teammates.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll figure out the one-on-one and how to score that way or create chances that way,\u201d Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson said. \u201cThere is also an element of working off your teammates. You are in the NHL, so everyone is a pretty good player and you\u2019re able to create using more than just yourself. I think he\u2019s figured that out.\u201d\nBedard found more success on the Blackhawks\u2019 last road trip. He left Chicago with five goals in 11 games and returned from Florida with nine goals in 13 games, scoring twice against the Tampa Bay Lightning and again against the Panthers.\nBedard wasn\u2019t so reliant on teammates on those goals, either. They were more about the work he\u2019s putting in on the other side of the puck.\n\u201cEven in practice, we\u2019ve talked to him about maybe tracking harder and attacking pucks on the forecheck and showing him a couple clips,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cTen, 12 games in, he\u2019s really figuring things out and realizes \u2014 why sit back and let things come to him? Go get it.\u201d\nNone of this is surprising to anyone involved. Bedard doesn\u2019t show it if he impresses himself. And as grateful as the Blackhawks are to have drafted Bedard, this is what they expected. This is why teams lined up to take losses last season.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the NHL that he was playing in the last few years,\u201d Davidson said, \u201cbut the level of performance and how he could control a game and dominate a game in junior \u2014 it indicated he was going to be able to do that at some point in the NHL. You just never how quickly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big adjustment, especially when you\u2019re playing against men and being focused on by the other team every single night. I\u2019m excited for him, but I don\u2019t necessarily feel like it\u2019s a huge surprise how quickly he\u2019s started to really find his groove at the NHL level. But it\u2019s exciting to watch.\u201d\n(Top photo: Ethan Miller \/ Getty Images)\n\nThis article, authored by The New York Times, was published by The New York Times on 2023-11-17 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":102}
{"title":"USC basketball futures odds to win Pac-12, NCAA tourney ahead of Bronny James collegiate debut","context":"## USC basketball futures odds to win Pac-12, NCAA tourney ahead of Bronny James collegiate debut\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve played eight games, roughly a quarter of their schedule, the USC Trojans basketball team hasn\u2019t really forged an identity.\nAndy Enfield\u2019s team has one of the nation\u2019s top freshmen in Isaiah Collier, a senior who most college basketball fans are familiar with in Boogie Ellis, and most recently lost to Gonzaga in Las Vegas 89-76 in a statement game.\nThe statement is that they\u2019re not as good as they were expected to be.\nUSC posted wins over Kansas State and Seton Hall in November, but lost a tight game to a Oklahoma to end the month and then really struggled against the Bulldogs at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Dec. 2, trailing from start to finish. Gonzaga led by as many as 18 points, overcame Ellis scoring 28 and outscored the Trojans 21-8 on fast breaks.\nAt the moment, USC isn\u2019t making the most of a talented roster. We\u2019re about to see whether Bronny James can have a positive impact since he\u2019s expected to make his debut on Sunday against Long Beach State.\nBronny James expected to make collegiate debut Sunday\nJames, the oldest son of LeBron James, is going to play his first college game on Sunday against Long Beach State after suffering cardiac arrest while practicing this summer. He's expected to be on a minutes restriction, but he\u2019ll be moving into the role that was envisioned for him as an impactful presence off the bench.\nHe may immediately provide a boost off the bench since USC can definitely use another body to improve depth.\nJames, a guard, is listed at 6-foot-4, weighs 210 pounds, and had a great prep career. ESPN viewed him as a top-20 recruit.\nJames excelled in the McDonald\u2019s All-American game, made big plays to aid Team USA\u2019s win in the most recent Hoop Summit and is expected to contribute immediately. It really doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s starting, but whether he\u2019s on the court to close out games will be intriguing to see.\nMore college hoops: Best college basketball betting sites | Latest sports betting promos\nUSC basketball futures odds to win Pac-12, make Final Four\nHere are the latest futures odds for USC at top-rated sportsbooks:\nUSC hasn\u2019t done much to enhance or tarnish its resume in the season\u2019s first few weeks. A loss to UC Irvine doesn\u2019t help its at-large chances but isn\u2019t a deal-breaker either. A solid showing in Pac-12 play should see them enter the NCAA Tournament field of 68 comfortably.\nWhile UCLA isn\u2019t expected to be as formidable as it has been in years past, Arizona is ranked No. 1 nationally and is basically an even money choice to win the Pac-12 as a clear favorite. At most books, USC is ranked as the second choice to win the conference behind the Wildcats.\nThey\u2019re listed as high as to win the National Championship depending on where you shop, so there\u2019s definitely an opportunity to cash in on them if you\u2019re bullish on their ability to improve and blossom into a title contender.\nCollier (+3500) and Ellis () have odds on them in the Player of the Year race, with Purdue\u2019s Zach Edey basically an even money favorite since he won last season and is off to a terrific start. Collier, a freshman, has lived up to the hype, averaging 17.3 points, 3.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists through his first eight games.\nHe\u2019s scored in double-figures each time out and has set a personal-best with six assists in each of the last two games. One concern is that he went just 2-for-6 from the free-throw line in the loss to Gonzaga, but he had shot the ball reasonably well beforehand so his off night may have just been an aberration.\nEllis is one of college basketball\u2019s best scorers, a shot creator who can get hot from the perimeter, so he should also enjoy a strong season in conference play.\nSmall forward Kobe Johnson, younger brother of Atlanta Hawks forward Jalen Johnson, is a great glue guy who can score, rebound and facilitate. 6-foot-6 Washington State transfer DJ Rodman, 6-foot-11 senior Joshua Morgan, 6-foot-11 freshman Arrinten Page and 7-foot-1 sophomore x-factor Vincent Iwuchukwu anchor the frontcourt, so James will have plenty of bodyguards and will presumably get minutes at the guard spots.\nIwuchukwu, who had his own health scare last season, was one of the nation\u2019s top recruits and comes off Enfield\u2019s bench. His potential as a game-changer is well known, but he\u2019s striving for consistency. If he and James develop chemistry among the USC reserves, this team is going to be tough to handle over the course of 40 minutes on a nightly basis.\nLong Beach State vs. USC odds: Point spread, total\nHere are the latest college basketball betting odds for Long Beach vs. USC:\nSpread: LBSU 14.5 (-110); USC 14.5 (-110)\nTotal: 159.5 (OVER\/UNDER -110)\nSunday's game against Long Beach State represents USC\u2019s last home game until conference play begins in January. The 49ers are 6-4 and have wins over major conference squads in DePaul and Michigan.\nThey upset the Wolverines in Ann Arbor and have beaten Iona, Montana State, and Sacramento State since then, losing to Illinois State and Louisiana. Highly respected head coach Dan Monson leads a solid team that is plenty capable of pulling off an upset at the Galen Center, so tread lightly if you\u2019re wagering on Bronny\u2019s debut.\nFollowing this contest, the Trojans will visit Auburn and Alabama State as they venture into the south to prepare for conference play. USC opens Pac-12 play at Oregon and Oregon State late this month before hosting Cal and Stanford. They\u2019ll only be an underdog against the Ducks, so there is a great opportunity on paper to get off to a strong start.\nThe Trojans play Arizona and UCLA twice, so their schedule is difficult, but there\u2019s no question there\u2019s enough talent in place to make a run at a title despite what went down last weekend against Gonzaga. If James is special as a difference maker, the Trojans are talented enough to factor into the Pac-12 race.\n\nThis article, authored by Tony Mejia, was published by Sporting News on 2023-12-09 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":103}
{"title":"The best Apple Black Friday deals on iPads, AirPods, Apple Watches and more","context":"## The best Apple Black Friday deals on iPads, AirPods, Apple Watches and more\n\nEngadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThere are still tons of Apple Black Friday deals you can shop for online; these are our favorites.\nMost of Apple\u2019s current-generation devices went on sale for Black Friday \u2014 and most of those deals look like they\u2019ll carry over through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. That means if you were otherwise occupied on Friday, you can still save on iPads, Apple Watches, MacBooks, AirPods and more. Some of the prices are new lows and many others match the record prices we\u2019ve seen previously. We\u2019ve tested and reviewed nearly every device below, so check out the links to our full reviews and guides if you need help deciding which deals to snag. These are the best Apple Black Friday deals you can still get today from retailers like Amazon, Target, Best Buy and B&H Photo.\nAirPod Black Friday deals\nAirPods Pro (2nd gen, USB-C)\nWhen Apple announced the new iPhone 15 and its conversion to USB-C charging, the company also revealed the second generation AirPods Pro with the same connector. That version has dropped to $190 at Amazon, Target, Best Buy. They\u2019ve gone or as low as $189 recently, so this is within a dollar of that price. Other than the port, the hardware hasn\u2019t changed so you\u2019re still getting the earbuds we named the best pick for iPhone users in our guide. In addition to pairing well with Apple\u2019s handsets, the buds also offer one of the best transparency modes on the market along with solid ANC and richer fuller sound than the previous generation Pros. The Lightning version is on sale for $169 at Walmart and $185 at Verizon.\nRead our full review of the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)\nAirPods Max\nThe over-ear AirPods Max are normally far too expensive for us to recommend. But now they're down to $450, which is a new low price and $30 cheaper than Prime Day in October. Get the deal at Amazon or Best Buy. They're $519 at B&H Photo. They are well-designed, comfortable, and implement all of the helpful Siri integrations. We also like the great noise cancellation and Spatial Audio. While they\u2019re a little heavy, the fit is still comfortable and the on-device controls, while unique, are simple and \u201ca joy to use.\u201d\nAirPods (3rd gen)\nThe third generation AirPods with the Lightning charging case are down to $140 at Amazon, Target and Best Buy. They carry a list price of $169 but often sell for closer to $150, so this is $10 off the usual. These non-Pro AirPods came out in 2021 and got a review score of 88 from us. They pair quickly with iPhones and are a good complement to Siri\u2019s helpfulness. They don\u2019t have ANC however \u2014 you\u2019ll need to go for the AirPods Pro for that feature \u2014 but they do have Adaptive EQ which monitors and adapts sound in real time. The fit is comfortable and they\u2019re water-resistant so they can handle workouts or the weather.\nMacBook Black Friday Day deals\nMacBook Pro (14-inch, 2023, M3)\nThe base model, 14-inch MacBook Pro with the new M3 chip just came out in October but is already$150 off for Black Friday. After testing the new chip, we think the base model with 8GB of RAM may quickly get bogged down. If it's within your budget, we recommend the model with 16GB of RAM, which is $150 off at B&H photo. And if you upgrade to a model with the M3 Pro chip for an even speedier experience \u2014 you'll get a $200 discount as it's down to $2,199 at B&H Photo. We gave the new M3 MacBook Pros an appreciative review and named them the best option for creatives in our buyer\u2019s guide.\nRead our review of the new MacBook Pros with the M3 chip\nMacBook Air (15-inch, 2023, M2)\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air arrived in June and added a little more screen real estate to an already great machine. It\u2019s down to $1,049 for Black Friday at Amazon and Best Buy. That\u2019s the same as the all-time low it\u2019s hit a few times these past couple of months. It's $200 off at B&H Photo. We gave it a 96 in our review and liked how the bigger screen let you get the most out of the M2 processor.\nNow that the M3 MacBook Pros have arrived, we\u2019re guessing Apple will come out with M3-enabled Air models in 2024. Still the M2 has plenty of processing power and will serve you well as both a casual machine for playing games and watching shows, but can also hold its own with productivity tasks.\nMacBook Air (13-inch, 2022, M2)\nThe M2-powered, 13-inch MacBook Air is on sale for $929 at B&H Photo. It\u2019s our top recommendation for a MacBook and beat out all brands in our laptop guide. The M2 chip is impressively fast and capable, the design is solid and the display is lovely. It\u2019s more than capable for both work and play and should give you years of dependable use. But, again, the M3-enabled Airs are likely on their way in 2024. So if you know you\u2019re drawn to the newest thing, you might want to wait.\nMacBook Air (13-inch, 2020, M1)\nThe MacBook Air with the M1 chip is a couple years old at this point, but still officially part of Apple\u2019s laptop lineup. It dropped to an all-time low of $750 for October\u2019s Prime Day at Amazon and now Amazon and Best Buy are selling it for the same price. It\u2019s the budget pick in our guide to MacBooks and the top pick in our guide to budget laptops. Check out our review from when it first came out in which we praised its quick speeds, excellent screen and good battery life.\nApple Watch Black Friday deals\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nPhoto by Cherlynn Low \/ Engadget Apple Watch Ultra 2 $730 $799 Save $69 with coupon The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has hit a new low price of $730, which is $69 off and cheaper than it was for October's Prime Day. Clip the on-page coupon to get the full deal. Save $69 with coupon $730 at Amazon\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is now $730 with an attached coupon, which is $69 off and a new low price. Get the deal at Amazon or without the coupon at Best Buy for $739. The Ultra 2 has the same new chip as the Apple Watch Series 9 so it can perform the new Double Tap trick, but also sports a more robust build and outdoor-specific features that make it suited to adventurers. There\u2019s a siren to alert people to your presence as well as a dive meter, waypoint setting capabilities and night mode to preserve your low-light vision. It's our recommended Apple Watch for adventurers.\nCheck out our guide to the best Apple Watches for 2023\nApple Watch Series 9\nThe new Apple Watch Series 9 is seeing a $70 discount that brings it to $330 at Amazon, Target and Walmart. That's a new low for the wearable. It debuted alongside the iPhone 15 back in September and the big change this time around is a new SiP (system in package) chip that allows for a Double Tap feature that lets you tap your thumb and forefinger together to answer calls and more. It also allows for the onboard processing of Siri requests, making simple demands (like starting a timer or a workout) happen faster.\nThe Series 9 has an always-on display and when paired with the Sport Loop is a carbon neutral product. As has been the case for many years now, the Apple Watch is an excellent fitness companion, offering comprehensive health and activity data. It also happens to be our favorite smartwatch for most people.\nRead our full review of the Apple Watch Series 9\nApple Watch SE\nThe most affordable smartwatch in the lineup is the Apple Watch SE, which is now down to $179. It has a list price of $249 but has regularly sold for $220 lately. We called it the best smartwatch money can buy in our review when it came out in 2022. It lacks an always-on display and a few of the more specialized health sensors, like the blood oxygen app, but the fitness features and tracking data are well-rounded, plus the notifications and integrations are particularly convenient for iPhone users.\nApple iPad Black Friday deals\niPad (9th generation)\nApple\u2019s ninth generation standard iPad dropped to a new all-time low of $249 during Amazon\u2019s October Prime Day sale and then hovered at the price for the next few weeks. Now it\u2019s down to $230 at Amazon and Target. It\u2019s not the newest slate, but it\u2019s the recommended budget pick in our guide to the best Apple Tablets because it\u2019s powerful enough for couch surfing, playing Apple Arcade games and watching Netflix \u2014 plus it's the most affordable way to get an iPad.\niPad (10th generation)\nThe tenth generation iPad is on sale for $349 at Amazon and Target, which is $100 off the list price. It has often sold for $399 lately so this is still $50 off the typical street price. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wild improvement over the previous generation, though it does orient the camera to the landscape edge, which is much better for video calling. The USB-C charging is more modern than the Lightning connector on the 9th gen iPad, but for some reason this model still works with the first generation Apple Pencil (even though the slate came out after the second-gen stylus).\niPad Air\nThe base model of the latest generation of the iPad Air has an MSRP of $599 and is now down to $499, a price its hit quite a few times in 2023. This is the iPad we recommend for most people because it\u2019s speedy, has a great screen and works with current-generation accessories. It can act as a rather powerful entertainment option for games and streaming, but is powerful enough to serve as a productivity device when paired up with a stylus or mouse and a keyboard. Now that the M3 chip has been loosed upon the world, the iPad Air, which houses the M1 chip, is primed for an update, which will likely come next year (along with a potential price increase).\niPad mini\nFor a more portable iPad experience, the iPad mini offers a bigger screen than your phone, but is barely as easy to carry around with you. It\u2019s listed at $499, but has dropped as low as $400 many times this year. Now it\u2019s back down to that low at Amazon, Target and Best Buy. The smaller iPad got a refresh last year, adding a new Liquid Retina screen, a Touch-ID top button instead of a Home button, and a USB-C charging. The performance is snappy and the integration with the second-generation Apple Pencil makes it excel as a digital notebook. As we said in our review, with the mini, Apple \u201cquashes notion that \u2018smaller\u2019 means \u2018lesser.\u2019\u201d\nApple accessories Black Friday deals\n$100 Apple Gift Card + $15 Amazon credit\nIf you purchase an Apple gift card totaling $100 or more from the retailer, you can get $15 in Amazon store credit for no extra cost. Just use the code APPLET5USA at checkout to see the offer. The deal applies to the digital version of the card; as of this writing, you can get the credit with a physical Apple gift card as well by using the code APPLET5USAP, though you may not want to clip the coupon on those cards' product page, as Amazon's listing says that will only give you a $10 credit. As a reminder, you can use an Apple gift card for App Store credit, subscription services like Apple Music or iCloud, and\/or purchases made at a physical Apple store.\nMagic Keyboard\nApple's Magic Keyboard is our pick for one of the best iPad accessories you can buy. It's a pretty pricey add-on but now that it's down to $215 at Amazon, it's a little easier to justify. It magnetically attaches to the latest iPad Pros and keeps them \u201cfloating\u201d above the keyboard (which also has a trackpad). We found it comfortable for typing and like that it acts as a cover when closed.\nCheck out our guide to the best iPad accessories for 2023\nApple AirTags\nA four-pack of Apple AirTags is $80 right now at Amazon, thanks to a 19 percent discount. They go for $29 each at full price, so the deal will save you $9 a pop. AirTags are our top picks for Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users as they tap into Apple\u2019s disturbingly vast FindMy network, using other Apple mobiles to find your lost stuff. If you want just a single AirTag, you can grab one for $24 (a $5 discount) at Walmart and Target.\nApple Pencil\nApple now makes three different Apple Pencils. The original recharges via Lightning. The second generation recharges wirelessly and the new USB-C looks a lot like the first generation, but charges via USB-C instead of lighting. Each one has different iPad compatibility with iPads. While that part is confusing, the pencil itself is rather elegant and one of the best accessories for your iPad. The 1st gen pencil is on sale for $73 at Amazon, while the 2nd generation stylus is down to $89. The USB-C model has an MSRP of $79 but is down to $71 at Amazon.\nApple TV 4K\nThe Apple TV 4K is our favorite premium streaming device and is currently $125 at B&H Photo. That's not a huge discount, but the streaming box rarely goes on sale. We gave it a 94 in our review because it\u2019s fast, has an excellent Siri remote and integrates seamlessly with Apple\u2019s overall ecosystem. Navigation is clean and easy to use, plus the device can stream in 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision.\nMac Mini M2\nThe base model of Apple diminutive desktop computer, the Mac mini, is currently on sale for $100 off for Black Friday at Amazon, B&H Photo, Best Buy. It earned an 86 in our review because it packs a lot of processing power, using the same M2 chip as the two current-model MacBook Airs \u2014 but it\u2019s much cheaper than either laptop. If you need a little more storage, you can get it with 512GB of SSD for $699 at B&H Photo.\nYour Black Friday Shopping Guide: See all of Yahoo\u2019s Black Friday coverage, here.

{"title":"Watch Argentina vs Paraguay live stream, TV channel, lineups, betting odds for World Cup qualifying match","context":"## Watch Argentina vs Paraguay live stream, TV channel, lineups, betting odds for World Cup qualifying match\n\nArgentina continue their start to CONMEBOL 2026 World Cup qualifying with a home date against Paraguay, the first of two qualifiers for the world champions in this international break.\nLionel Messi has been dealing with fitness concerns the past few weeks, missing significant time for his club Inter Miami, but he is on the roster and expected to play a part for the national team. According to a report from Argentina, Messi will not start tonight's match, but he is likely to play much or all of the second half.\nHe is helping to usher in a youth movement up front for Argentina, with Julian Alvarez and Alejandro Garnacho considered the future of the forward line. With Angel Di Maria not fit for duty this month, that will be even more in the spotlight here and in the follow-up in Peru.\nParaguay were not close to qualifying for the last World Cup, unable to reach a FIFA tournament since 2010.

{"title":"Meta has a moderation bias problem, not just a \u2018bug,\u2019 that\u2019s suppressing Palestinian voices","context":"## Meta has a moderation bias problem, not just a \u2018bug,\u2019 that\u2019s suppressing Palestinian voices\n\nMeta has a moderation bias problem, not just a \u2018bug,\u2019 that\u2019s suppressing Palestinian voices Instagram users suspect Meta of shadowbanning content about Palestine. The platform has a history of inherent bias.\nEarlier this year, Palestinian-American filmmaker Khitam Jabr posted a handful of Reels about her family\u2019s trip to the West Bank. In the short travel vlogs, Jabr shared snippets of Palestinian culture, from eating decadent meals to dancing at her niece\u2019s wedding.\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t been in a decade, so it\u2019s just like, life abroad,\u201d Jabr told TechCrunch.\n\u201cI would get [anti-Palestine] comments,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t respond [to them] or use my account for 24 hours. I wasn\u2019t even posting anything about the occupation. But fast forward to now and the same shit\u2019s happening.\u201d\nIn the aftermath of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israelis, Israel\u2019s retaliatory airstrikes and total blockade \u2014 cutting access to electricity, water and vital supplies \u2014 have devastated Gaza. In response to the escalating violence, Meta said that it is closely monitoring its platforms for violations and may inadvertently flag certain content, but it never intends to \u201csuppress a particular community or point of view.\u201d Content praising or supporting Hamas, which governs Gaza and is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, is expressly forbidden on Meta\u2019s platforms.\nAs the humanitarian crisis in Gaza grows more dire, many social media users suspect Instagram of censoring content about the besieged Palestinian territory, even if that content doesn\u2019t support Hamas. Users have also complained that they\u2019ve been harassed and reported for posting content about Palestine, regardless of whether or not it violates Meta\u2019s policies. Jabr, for example, suspects that Instagram restricted her for 24 hours because other users reported her Palestine travel videos. Most recently, Instagram users accused Meta of \u201cshadowbanning\u201d their Stories about Palestine.\nIt\u2019s the latest in a lengthy history of incidents on Meta platforms that reflect an inherent bias against Palestinian users in its processes, as documented by years of complaints from both inside and outside the company. The company may not intentionally suppress specific communities, but its moderation practices often disproportionately affect Palestinian users.\nFor instance, Meta struggles to navigate the cultural and linguistic nuances of Arabic, a language with over 25 dialects, and has been criticized for neglecting to adequately diversify its language resources. The company\u2019s black-and-white policies often preclude it from effectively moderating any nuanced topic, like content that discusses violence without condoning it. Advocacy groups have also raised concerns that Meta\u2019s partnerships with government agencies, such as the Israeli Cyber Unit, politically influence the platform\u2019s policy decisions.\nDuring the last violent outbreak between Hamas and Israel in 2021, a report commissioned by Meta and conducted by a third party concluded that the company\u2019s actions had an \u201cadverse human rights impact\u201d on Palestinian users\u2019 right to freedom of expression and political participation.\nMeta communications director Andy Stone declined to comment on the record, and pointed TechCrunch to Meta\u2019s newsroom post about the conflict, which was updated on Oct. 18 with a statement addressing the shadowbanning claims.\n\u201cOur policies are designed to keep people safe on our apps while giving everyone a voice,\u201d the post stated. \u201cWe apply these policies equally around the world and there is no truth to the suggestion that we are deliberately suppressing voice \u2026 We can make errors and that is why there is an appeals process for people to tell us when they think we have made the wrong decision, so we can look into it.\u201d\nThe belief that Meta shadowbans, or limits the visibility of, content about Palestine is not new. In an Instagram Story last year, supermodel and activist Bella Hadid, who is of Palestinian descent, alleged that Instagram \u201cdisabled\u201d her from posting content on her Story \u201cpretty much only when it is Palestine based.\u201d She said she gets \u201cimmediately shadowbanned\u201d when she posts about Palestine, and her Story views drop by \u201calmost 1 million.\u201d\nAs soon as Kehlani got super vocal and changed her profile picture to \u201ci stand with Palestine\u201d she got shadowbanned.\nJust as they did to Bella Hadid. The propaganda is insane.\nTHEY TRY TO SILENCE US. DON\u2019T STOP!!\nFREE PALESTINE. \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com\/4lUvZsUbiA \u2014 Sabby Targaryen \ud83d\udc09 (@whoisitbad) October 14, 2023\nMeta blamed technical errors for the removal of posts about Palestine during the 2021 conflict. When reached for comment about these recent claims of shadowbanning, a representative for the company pointed TechCrunch to a Threads post by Stone.\n\u201cWe identified a bug impacting all Stories that re-shared Reels and Feed posts, meaning they weren\u2019t showing up properly in people\u2019s Stories tray, leading to significantly reduced reach,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThis bug affected accounts equally around the globe and had nothing to do with the subject matter of the content \u2014 and we fixed it as quickly as possible.\u201d\nBut many are frustrated that Meta continues to disproportionately suppress Palestinian voices. Leen Al Saadi, a Palestinian journalist currently based in Jordan and host of the podcast \u201cPreserving Palestine,\u201d said she is used to \u201cconstantly being censored.\u201d Her Instagram account was restricted last year after she posted a trailer for the podcast\u2019s first episode, which discussed a documentary about Palestinian street art under occupation.\n\u201cPalestinians are currently undergoing two wars,\u201d Al Saadi said. \u201cThe first is with their legal occupier. The second war is with the entire Western media landscape, and when I say the entire landscape, I mean social media.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s alleged shadowbanning\nInstagram users accuse Meta of suppressing more than just Stories related to Palestine.\nCreators say engagement on their posts tanked specifically after they publicly condemned Israel\u2019s response to the Hamas attack as excessively violent. Some, like Jabr, say they were restricted from posting or going live, while others say Instagram flagged their content as \u201csensitive,\u201d limiting its reach. Users also allege their posts were flagged as \u201cinappropriate\u201d and removed, even if the content adhered to Instagram\u2019s Community Guidelines.\nMeta\u2019s representative didn\u2019t address the other accusations of censorship beyond just Story visibility and did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s follow-up questions. When asked for comment, Stone directed TechCrunch to Meta\u2019s updated newsroom post, which said Meta identified and fixed a \u201cbug\u201d that prevented users from going live.\n\u201cThis was also a global issue that was fixed within a few hours. We understand people rely on these tools and we\u2019re sorry to anyone who felt the impact of these issues,\u201d the post stated.\nIt\u2019s unclear if this \u201cbug\u201d impacted accounts posting content unrelated to Gaza. Instagram users have posted screenshots showing that Stories about Palestine have received significantly fewer views than other Stories posted on the same day, and allege that their view counts went back up when they posted content unrelated to the conflict.\nofc IG\u2019s hiding my stories about Palestine, y\u2019all see the difference? lmaoaoaoao pic.twitter.com\/1iYIIKBhtN \u2014 \u0f12\ufe0e (@arxbprince) October 15, 2023\nA user based in Egypt, who asked to stay anonymous for fear of harassment, said her posts usually get around 300 views, but when she started posting pro-Palestine content after the Hamas attack earlier this month, her stories would only get one to two views.\n\u201cIt happened to all my friends, too,\u201d she continued. \u201cThen we noticed that posting a random pic would get higher views. So by posting a random pic, then a pro-Palestine post, would increase the views.\u201d\nAnother Instagram user based in the United Kingdom, who also asked to stay anonymous out of fear of harassment, said that his view count returned to normal when he posted a cat photo.\n\u201cMy stories went from 100s of views to zero or a handful,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to post intermittent non-Gaza content in order to \u2018release\u2019 my stories to be viewed again.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t just Stories. The Arab Center for Social Media Advancement (7amleh), which documents cases of Palestinian digital rights violations and works directly with social media companies to appeal violations, told TechCrunch it has received reports of Instagram inconsistently filtering comments containing the Palestinian flag emoji. Users report that Instagram has flagged comments containing the emoji as \u201cpotentially offensive,\u201d hiding the comment.\nMeta initially did not respond to follow-up requests for comment. When asked for comment, Stone pointed TechCrunch to Meta\u2019s updated newsroom post, which did not directly address issues related to comments containing the Palestinian flag.\nThe organization has also received countless reports of Meta flagging and restricting Arabic content, even if it\u2019s posted by news outlets. Jalal Abukhater, 7amleh\u2019s advocacy manager, said that the organization has documented multiple cases of journalists on Instagram reporting the same news in Arabic, Hebrew and English, but only getting flagged for their Arabic content.\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally journalistic content, but the same wording in Hebrew and English does not get restricted,\u201d Abukhater said. \u201cAs if there\u2019s better moderation for those languages, and more careless moderation for Arabic content.\u201d\nStone declined to comment on allegations of Meta disproportionately flagging Arabic news content, instead directing TechCrunch to the updated newsroom post \u2014 which did not directly address the allegations.\nAnd as the Intercept reported, Instagram and Facebook are flagging images of the al-Ahli Hospital, claiming that the content violates Meta\u2019s Community Guidelines on nudity or sexual activity.\nThe Community Guidelines are enforced inconsistently, particularly when it comes to content related to Palestine. Al Saadi recently tried to report a comment that said she should be \u201craped\u201d and \u201cburned alive\u201d \u2014 left in response to her comment on a CNN post about the conflict \u2014 but in screenshots reviewed by TechCrunch, Instagram said that it didn\u2019t violate the platform\u2019s Community Guidelines against violence or dangerous organizations.\n\u201cThe restrictions on content, especially the content that relates to Palestine, is heavily politicized,\u201d Abukhater said. \u201cIt feeds into the bias against Palestinian narrative genuinely. It really takes the balance against Palestinians in a situation where there\u2019s a huge asymmetry of power.\u201d\nA history of suppression\nContent about Palestine is disproportionately scrutinized, as demonstrated during the last severe violent outbreak between Hamas and Israel two years ago. Amid the violence following the May 2021 court ruling to evict Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in occupied East Jerusalem, users across Facebook and Instagram accused Meta of taking down posts and suspending accounts that voiced support for Palestinians.\nThe digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) described Meta\u2019s actions in 2021 as \u201csystemic censorship of Palestinian voices.\u201d In its 2022 report of Palestinian digital rights, 7amleh said that Meta is \u201cstill the most restricting company\u201d compared to other social media giants in the extent of its moderation of the Palestinian digital space.\nMeta forbids support of terrorist organizations, like most social media companies based in the U.S., but struggles to moderate content around it, from user discourse to journalistic updates. This policy, along with the company\u2019s partnership with Israel to monitor posts that incite violence, complicates things for Palestinians living under Hamas\u2019 governance. As EFF points out, something as simple as Hamas\u2019 flag in the background of an image can result in a strike.\nJillian York, the director for international freedom of expression for EFF, blames automation and decisions made by \u201cminimally trained humans\u201d for the inconsistency. Meta\u2019s zero tolerance policy and imprecise enforcement often suppress content from or about conflict zones, she said. The site\u2019s moderation issues have negatively affected multiple non-English speaking regions, including Libya, Syria and Ukraine.\n\u201cThese rules can prevent people from sharing documentation of human rights violations, documentation of war crimes, even just news about what\u2019s happening on the ground,\u201d York continued. \u201cAnd so I think that is what is the most problematic right now about that particular rule, and the way that it\u2019s enforced.\u201d\nOver the 13 days leading up to the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, 7amleh documented more than 500 reports of Palestinian \u201cdigital rights violations,\u201d including the removal and restriction of content, hashtags and accounts related to the conflict.\nMeta blamed some of the instances of perceived censorship to technical issues, like one that prevented users in Palestine and Colombia from posting Instagram Stories. It attributed others to human error, like blocking the hashtag for Al-Aqsa Mosque, the holy site where Israeli police clashed with Ramadan worshippers, because it was mistaken for a terrorist organization. The company also blocked journalists in Gaza from WhatsApp without explanation.\nThe same month, a group of Facebook employees filed internal complaints accusing the company of bias against Arab and Muslim users. In internal posts obtained by BuzzFeed News, an employee attributed the bias to \u201cyears and years of implementing policies that just don\u2019t scale globally.\u201d\nAt the recommendation of its Oversight Board, Meta conducted a third-party due diligence report about the platform\u2019s moderation during the May 2021 conflict. The report found that Arabic content was flagged as potentially violating at significantly higher rates than Hebrew content was, and was more likely to be erroneously removed. The report noted that Meta\u2019s moderation system may not be as precise for Arabic content as it was for Hebrew content, because the latter is a \u201cmore standardized language,\u201d and suggested that reviewers may lack the linguistic and cultural competence to understand less common Arabic dialects like Palestinian Arabic.\nHas anything improved?\nMeta committed to implementing policy changes based on the report\u2019s recommendations, such as updating its keywords associated with dangerous organizations, disclosing government requests to remove content and launching a hostile speech classifier for Hebrew content. Abukhater added that Meta has improved its response to harassment, at least in comparison to other social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Although harassment and abuse are still rampant on Instagram and Facebook, he said, the company has been responsive to suspending accounts with patterns of targeting other users.\nThe company has also made more contact with regional Palestinian organizations since 2021, York added, but it\u2019s been slow to implement recommendations from EFF and other advocacy groups. It\u2019s \u201cvery clear\u201d that Meta is not putting the same resources behind Arabic and other non-English languages, York said, compared to the attention Meta gives to countries that have the most regulatory pressure. Moderation of English and other European languages tends to be more comprehensive, for example, because the EU enforces the Digital Services Act.\nIn Meta\u2019s response to the report, Miranda Sissons, the company\u2019s director of human rights, said that Meta was \u201cassessing the feasibility\u201d of reviewing Arabic content by dialect. Sissons said that the company has \u201clarge and diverse teams\u201d who understand \u201clocal cultural context across the region,\u201d including in Palestine. Responding to the escalating violence earlier this month, Meta stated that it established a \u201cspecial operations center\u201d staffed with fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers to closely monitor and respond to violating content.\nDespite Meta\u2019s apparent efforts to diversify its language resources, Arabic is still disproportionately flagged as violating \u2014 like in the case of journalists reporting news in multiple languages.\n\u201cThe balance of power is very fixed, in reality, between Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d Abukhater said. \u201cAnd this is something that today is reflected heavily on platforms like Meta, even though they have human rights teams releasing reports and trying to improve upon their policies. Whenever an escalation like the one we\u2019re experiencing now happens, things just go back to zero.\u201d\nAnd at times, Meta\u2019s Arabic translations are completely inaccurate. This week, multiple Instagram users raised concerns over the platform mistranslating the relatively common Arabic phrase \u201cAlhamdulillah,\u201d or \u201cPraise be to God.\u201d In screen recordings posted online, users found that if they included \u201cPalestinian\u201d and the corresponding flag emoji in their Instagram bio along with the Arabic phrase, Instagram automatically translated their bio to \u201cPalestinian terrorists \u2013 Praise be to Allah\u201d or \u201cPraise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom.\u201d When users removed \u201cPalestinian\u201d and the flag emoji, Instagram translated the Arabic phrase to \u201cThank God.\u201d Instagram users complained that the offensive mistranslation was active for hours before Meta appeared to correct it.\nShayaan Khan, a TikTok creator who posted a viral video about the mistranslation, told TechCrunch that Meta\u2019s lack of cultural competence isn\u2019t just offensive, it\u2019s dangerous. He said that the \u201cglitch\u201d can fuel Islamophobic and racist rhetoric, which has already been exacerbated by the war in Gaza. Khan pointed to the fatal stabbing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian-American child whose death is being investigated as a hate crime.\nMeta did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment about the mistranslation. Abukhater said that Meta told 7amleh that a \u201cbug\u201d caused the mistranslation. In a statement to 404 Media, a Meta spokesperson said that the issue had been fixed.\n\u201cWe fixed a problem that briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations in some of our products,\u201d the statement said, \u201cWe sincerely apologize that this happened.\u201d\nAs the war continues, social media users have tried to find ways around the alleged shadowbanning on Instagram. Supposed loopholes include misspelling certain words, like \u201cp@lestine\u201d instead of \u201cPalestine,\u201d in hopes of bypassing any content filters. Users also share information about Gaza in text superimposed over unrelated images, like a cat photo, so it won\u2019t be flagged as graphic or violent content. Creators have tried to include an emoji of the Israeli flag or tag their posts and Stories with #istandwithisrael, even if they don\u2019t support the Israeli government, in hopes of gaming engagement.\nAl Saadi said that her frustration with Meta is common among Palestinians, both in occupied territories and across the diaspora.\n\u201cAll we\u2019re asking for is to give us the exact same rights,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for more. We\u2019re literally just asking Meta, Instagram, every single broadcast channel, every single media outlet, to just give us the respect that we deserve.\u201d\nDominic-Madori Davis contributed to this story\u2019s reporting.\n\nThis article, authored by Morgan Sung, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-10-19 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":106}
{"title":"Norway seeks to extend ban on Meta\u2019s consentless tracking ads across the EU","context":"## Norway seeks to extend ban on Meta\u2019s consentless tracking ads across the EU\n\nNorway\u2019s data protection authority has asked a European Union regulator to take a binding decision on whether its emergency sanction on Facebook and Instagram tracking and profiling users for ad targeting without their consent should be made permanent and applied across the EU single market, not just locally.\nThe move could lead to a blanket ban on Meta running tracking ads without consent across the EU single market if the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) agrees the action is merited. Meta may also switch to asking users for their permission to run \u201cpersonalized ads\u201d before any Board action, as it has claimed it intends to.\nThe Datatilsynet issued a local ban on Meta tracking and profiling users without consent back in July \u2014 using powers in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which enable concerned regulators to apply temporary measures (lasting for three months) in their markets if they see an urgent need to act to protect citizens\u2019 data. So while Meta\u2019s lead regulator for the GDPR remains the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), which would normally lead on any enforcement, the Norwegian DPA\u2019s emergency action circumvents the regulation\u2019s so-called \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d mechanism \u2014 and gives the Norwegian authority the option to refer ongoing concerns to the EDPB, as it has now done.\nMeta has continued to flout the Datatilsynet order \u2014 which includes a daily fine of up to one million NOK (~$100,000) per day for non-compliance \u2014 ignoring the authority\u2019s requirement not to run tracking ads without permission, per a spokesperson for the DPA.\nThe tech giant instead sought a court injunction against the order. However, earlier this month, an Oslo court rejected Meta\u2019s arguments, affirming the DPA\u2019s right to act.\nReached by email the EDPB confirmed receipt of the authority\u2019s request. \u201cThe EDPB Secretariat will now assess completeness of the file. Once this assessment is complete, the deadline under art. 66(4) GDPR starts running and the Board will have two weeks to adopt its urgent binding decision,\u201d a spokeswoman told us.\nShe declined to offer any steer on how long the Board\u2019s assessment of the Datatilsynet\u2019s request will take to complete.\nThe Board already took one binding decision vis-a-vis Meta ads: Late last year it settled a dispute between DPAs on a complaint against the legal basis the adtech giant claimed for running the ads \u2014 which led on, in January, to a final decision being issued by the DPC rejecting Meta\u2019s claim of contractual necessity to justify the processing.\nSince then Meta tried another switch of legal basis for the processing \u2014 to a claim of legitimate interests \u2014 but the EU\u2019s top court quashed that gambit with a ruling in July, related to a separate challenge brought by Germany\u2019s competition authority, which confirmed Meta cannot claim a legitimate interest to run its \u201cpersonalized ads\u201d in the absence of user consent.\nThat landmark strike was followed at the start of August by Meta announcing an \u201cintention\u201d to legalize its tracking ads business in the region by asking users for their permission. But it has still not done so \u2014 continuing to run unlawful ads. Hence why the Norwegian DPA decided to take emergency action \u2014 pointing out that millions of EU people\u2019s rights are being infringed.\nReached for a response to the DPA\u2019s referral the EDPB, Meta spokesperson, Matt Pollard, sought to deflect attention off-of the current lack of compliance \u2014 writing in an emailed statement:\nWe are surprised by the NDPA\u2019s [Norwegian data protection authority\u2019s] actions, given that Meta has already committed to moving to the legal basis of consent for advertising in the EU\/EEA. We remain in active discussions with the relevant data protection authorities on this topic via our lead regulator in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and will have more to share in due course.\nAsked when Meta will be moving to a lawful basis for tracking and profiling users in the region Pollard declined to specify a timeframe. \u201cWe have not announced a date.

But if the Irish authority is too slow to rectify Meta\u2019s lack of consent this time there is now the backstop option of the Board stepping in a second time and finishing the job for it.\n\nThis article, authored by Natasha Lomas, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-09-28 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":107}
{"title":"How U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer Team Lured Emma Hayes Away From Chelsea","context":"## How U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer Team Lured Emma Hayes Away From Chelsea\n\nChelsea Women had created a frenzy. On Nov. 4, the English club released a statement saying their coach Emma Hayes was leaving at the end of the season to \u201cpursue a new opportunity outside of the Women\u2019s Super League and club football.\u201d Hayes had just entered her second decade in charge of the club, and few knew where she would land next.\nAdvertisement\nThat same day The Athletic, among others, reported that Hayes\u2019 next job would be with the U.S. women\u2019s national team, leading a four-time World Cup and Olympic gold medal-winning program into a new era. On Tuesday, U.S. Soccer made her appointment official.\nHayes, who previously won six WSL titles in England, will become the 10th full-time coach of the U.S., but not until her final season with Chelsea is complete next May. Sporting director Matt Crocker made the final decision to hire Hayes after a search process that began in August, following the team\u2019s surprising exit in the round of 16 at the World Cup and the subsequent departure of head coach Vlatko Andonovski.\n\u201cShe has tremendous energy and an insatiable will to win,\u201d U.S. Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone said in a statement. \u201cHer experience in the USA, her understanding of our soccer landscape and her appreciation of what it means to coach this team makes her a natural fit for this role and we could not be more pleased to have her leading our women\u2019s national team forward.\u201d\nThough Hayes is seen as one of the world\u2019s top coaches in women\u2019s soccer, the appointment still comes as something of a surprise. Here\u2019s how the deal got done.\nDetails of the deal\nAt least part of the surprise surrounding Hayes\u2019 hire \u2013 and the six-month runway before she officially takes charge \u2013 is down to U.S. Soccer\u2019s own messaging. Crocker, in a September meeting with U.S. reporters along with Cone and U.S. Soccer CEO J.T. Batson, said he hoped to have a new head coach in place by December.\nBut the initial contact with Hayes was made a couple of months ago, early into the search, with all three top-level executives from U.S. Soccer involved in those talks. The trio also described the interview process to journalists in that September meeting \u2013 a U.S. soccer statement describes it as involving \u201cpsychometrics and abstract reasoning tests, in-depth discussions of strategy, coaching philosophy and the current player pool, as well as evaluation on the reactions to pressure, culture-building and interactions with players and staff.\u201d USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter went through a similar process, including an abstract reasoning test, when he was re-hired by Crocker earlier in 2023.\nAdvertisement\nThe hiring process included multiple rounds of evaluation, with the list of candidates becoming smaller each time. The first pass was driven purely by data, which was then whittled down to a double-digit list Crocker was considering as of September, and then a final shortlist, which also included Tony Gustavsson, head coach of Australia. Multiple sources confirmed both Hayes and Gustavsson flew to the U.S. for interviews.\nOne source who was briefed on the situation said the federation had also checked in on the availability of Sarina Wiegman, despite clear messaging from both the English FA and Wiegman herself in August. \u201cI\u2019m staying out of it. I\u2019ve heard it (from the press officer) but no, I\u2019m with England and I\u2019m really happy with England, and I have a contract until 2025,\u201d Wiegman said. A representative from her camp declined to comment for this story.\nCrocker said in September that the final interviews would include lengthy technical and tactical assessments, as well as questions to determine the candidates\u2019 cultural fit. He and the federation stayed fairly consistent on their desired start date since the head coach role opened in August, but that became one of the major concessions made by U.S. Soccer in selecting Hayes.\nShe\u2019s headed Stateside \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 U.S. Soccer has appointed Emma Hayes as the 10th full-time head coach in #USWNT history \u00bb https:\/\/t.co\/sR7qfSnWVx Welcome, Emma! pic.twitter.com\/WYn6Sg9RmX \u2014 U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) November 14, 2023\nHayes will remain exclusively with Chelsea through the end of their WSL campaign and the Champions League season. She will not work with the U.S. in international windows.\n\u201cI\u2019m here until the end,\u201d she said in her press conference on Friday. \u201cI haven\u2019t died, I haven\u2019t gone anywhere. I\u2019m here, doing this job. My full focus and attention is on what I do for Chelsea.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHayes could be tied up with Chelsea as late as May 25 if the London club makes the Champions League final; notably, an international window that would theoretically be Hayes\u2019 first in charge begins just two days later, on May 27.\nHowever, there are ways in which the arrangement will benefit U.S. Soccer. The federation won\u2019t owe any compensation to Chelsea, and Hayes will be fully committed to the program, with a move to Chicago in the works for next year following the completion of her time in London. Eventually, she\u2019s expected to relocate to Atlanta thanks to U.S. Soccer\u2019s planned combined headquarters and national training facility in Georgia. As of yet, there\u2019s no targeted date set for the move.\nHayes, too, will benefit in ways other than compensation and prestige. She spoke to reporters about looking forward to spending more time with her five-year-old son, Harry. She has never been to one of his sports days, picked him up from school or taken him to an after-school club and she wants to do that.\nThe main visible wrinkle in the process was Chelsea\u2019s surprise move of announcing Hayes\u2019 departure on Saturday, Nov. 4. With the contract not yet finalized and U.S. Soccer board approval still needed, Chelsea issued their statement at 11 a.m. ET in the U.S. in which it noted she would leave at the end of the season \u201cto pursue a new opportunity outside of the WSL and club football.\u201d The club feared that the news was starting to leak and wanted to share the news on its own. This began the race to confirm Hayes had been selected as the USWNT head coach.\nTalks between U.S. Soccer and Hayes\u2019 representatives continued even after Chelsea\u2019s press release. The federation\u2019s board convened late on Saturday, Nov. 4 to approve the selection, even without the final details of the contract settled or signed.\nAt the end of it all, the sides have agreed to a deal that will make Hayes the highest-paid women\u2019s football coach in the world \u2014 though her salary is not tied to equal compensation with Berhalter. While her salary is in the same range as the USMNT head coach, it\u2019s thought to be a reflection of the market value for Hayes. With reports that Chelsea was prepared to quadruple her salary to keep her, Hayes herself danced around the details in her first media availability with the club.\n\u201cI believe in private conversations,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m disappointed to hear things being said in the press. I want to make sure I maintain my own professionalism in everything I do.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nU.S Soccer\u2019s annual financial reports reveal the salaries of their head coaches and other executives. While Berhalter received a new contract this year, his previous deal that ran from April 2021 to March 2022, earned him $1.6 million, including $300,000 in bonuses. During that same time, Andonovski earned $446,495, of which only $50,000 was bonus money. With Hayes expected to earn close to $2 million per year in her deal, this will likely create a knock-on effect for other international women\u2019s coaches negotiating their next contracts.\nU.S. Soccer\u2019s rollout of their new head coach has not been an easy one for the federation\u2019s communications staff, considering that Hayes is essentially unavailable for any formal ceremonies or media appearances until her time with Chelsea is complete.\n\u201cThis is a huge honor to be given the opportunity to coach the most incredible team in world football history,\u201d she said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe feelings and connection I have for this team and for this country run deep. I\u2019ve dreamed about coaching the USA for a long time so to get this opportunity is a dream come true. I know there is work to do to achieve our goals of winning consistently at the highest levels. To get there, it will require dedication, devotion and collaboration from the players, staff and everyone at the U.S. Soccer Federation.\u201d\nLooking ahead for the USWNT\nHayes\u2019 appointment will have an immediate impact, even if she\u2019s not immediately present. The particulars around timing and the plan moving forward have been one of the areas of discussion between Hayes and her representatives, Chelsea and U.S. Soccer that has continued through the start of November.\nUnless the situation changes drastically, Hayes will only have two camps, including four friendlies, with the USWNT ahead of the 2024 Olympics in Paris. She\u2019ll miss three international windows between Tuesday\u2019s announcement and her planned start date, including the 2024 CONCACAF Gold Cup in February and March.\nU.S. Soccer has a plan in place for the transition. Current interim head coach Twila Kilgore will continue in the role through May and will remain as a permanent assistant coach under Hayes after the swap is complete. U.S. Soccer said that Kilgore and the rest of the technical staff are working on a handoff plan for Hayes.\n\u201cThis is a unique situation, but the team is in safe hands with Twila,\u201d Crocker said. \u201cHer stewardship will be crucial during this period as we are focused on success at the Olympics. Emma has endorsed Twila, she will be a key part of Emma\u2019s staff when she arrives and moving forward, and we are excited for what\u2019s to come with our USWNT program.\u201d\nGO DEEPER How Emma Hayes' winning ways at Chelsea can benefit USWNT on the field\nIt\u2019s still an extremely tight turn for the Olympics, with 18 days for Hayes to get situated with the team ahead of the tournament, between the two international windows from May 27 to June 4, then July 8 to 16. The Olympic tournament will start on July 25.\nAdvertisement\nThere are, of course, logistical questions about roster selection over the next few months. Some of those may be answered relatively soon, with the roster for the upcoming camp that begins at the end of the month imminent. The greater challenge will likely be ongoing player evaluation over the next six months, at a time of great transition within the squad. The specifics of how that will work without Hayes\u2019 involvement remain a mystery. It would be understandable for players to feel like they are still auditioning for an absent director until May rolls around, while still knowing they must perform at the USWNT standard.\nAlong these same lines, there is at least the suggestion that the federation could be willing to sacrifice coherent preparation for this upcoming Olympic tournament to focus more on the longer-term project of the 2027 World Cup. That itself represents a marked change from the expectations and pressure of constant performance and winning that the team is known for.\nIs that a good or a bad thing? Perhaps a little bit of both. The USWNT shouldn\u2019t be ruled out of contention for the Olympics by any stretch, but this past summer\u2019s World Cup did reveal that the problems facing the team are far more foundational than just poor coaching decisions or the strange midfield chemistry. Balancing realism with the pressure to win feels like a much more sustainable path forward for the USWNT.\nGO DEEPER USWNT's Emma Hayes hire could create a problem in preparation for the Olympics\nWhat\u2019s next for Chelsea?\nQuestions surrounding Hayes\u2019 future have cropped up previously in her tenure at Chelsea. She was linked to several jobs in the men\u2019s English Football League in the past and has always been interested in managing Spain\u2019s national team, although there was never an official conversation with Spain\u2019s federation. So it was a question of when, not if, Hayes would leave. Still, news of her decision came as a shock to her staff and players.\nA few staff members were told on the morning of Nov. 4 before Chelsea\u2019s away game at Aston Villa kicked off at 12.30 p.m. UK time. Most of the other staff members found out with the players in the post-match meeting minutes before the official club statement, which Hayes had no hand in writing and did not even see before publication, was released at 3 p.m.\nEngland and Chelsea captain Millie Bright was \u201cdevastated,\u201d and most players were understandably sad \u2014 many of whom owe their career progression to Hayes \u2014 but know they still have a job to do this season.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a whirlwind. As a player and a person, I was devastated. I\u2019ve been here nine years under Emma and the things I\u2019ve learned,\u201d Bright said. \u201cShe\u2019s a mentor, a coach, a friend, a life coach. It\u2019s more than just football playing under her.\u201d\nBright credits Hayes for her on and off-field guidance. (Photo by Marc Atkins, Getty Images)\nHayes\u2019 American assistant Denise Reddy, born in New Jersey, is likely to follow her across the pond. The former United States Under-20 coach has remained faithful to her friend of 20 years and voluntarily quit her job as assistant at Chicago Red Stars in 2010 when Hayes was fired as head coach. Chelsea\u2019s general manager Paul Green will stay at the club. It is unclear whether any other members of Chelsea\u2019s technical staff are expected to depart.\nGO DEEPER What next for Chelsea after Emma Hayes?\nThe relentless nature of managing a club takes its toll and after what will be 12 years at Chelsea come the end of the season, Hayes, a single parent whose father died last month, decided that it was the right time for a change, professionally and personally.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe biggest factors are my son, leaving at the top and giving the club enough time to be able to transition without there being too much disruption,\u201d she said in her press conference.\nThe club has received several applications regarding Hayes\u2019 replacement but has not yet started an official recruitment process. She will meet with Chelsea\u2019s technical directors once a week to create a succession plan and will have a say in who takes the job after her.\nThere is the possibility of Hayes retaining a connection to the club via some sort of ambassadorial role, but it\u2019s likely contingent upon a lack of conflict with the USWNT role and responsibilities. Under American Todd Boehly\u2019s co-ownership, expanding Chelsea\u2019s profile and reach in the U.S. would make sense, especially with USWNT internationals Catarina Macario and Mia Fishel playing their club football there \u2014 and CBS Sports holding WSL rights.\nThere is, for now, an immediate task for Hayes to focus on. Chelsea faces off against Real Madrid on Wednesday for their first match of the UWCL Champions League group stage. Her full American arrival will not come for another half a year after that.\n(Top photo: Julian Finney\/Getty Images)\n\nThis article, authored by The New York Times, was published by The New York Times on 2023-11-15 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":108}
{"title":"Pochettino looks past James mistake and stakes future on his \u2018Chelsea DNA\u2019","context":"## Pochettino looks past James mistake and stakes future on his \u2018Chelsea DNA\u2019\n\nIt was the moment when Reece James simply could not handle the frustration. Named by Mauricio Pochettino as the Chelsea captain, James had not played since the opening weekend draw with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge when he injured a hamstring. Now, he seethed from the sideline as his team lost 1-0 at home to Aston Villa, a game in which his replacement, Malo Gusto, was controversially sent off.\nIt was 24 September, Chelsea\u2019s second home Premier League defeat on the spin after the one against Nottingham Forest and they were booed off again. James would lose his cool with an official in the tunnel and, when a Football Association charge was announced three days later for abusive conduct, it felt like only a matter of time before he was given a one-match ban.\nIt did not come in time for Chelsea\u2019s visit to Fulham on 2 October, when James was still injured. That would have been too simple. Rather for their next game at Burnley on 7 October when, according to Pochettino, James was back in contention for selection.\nThe 23-year-old was not called up by England for the internationals over this past window and the idea was that he would work to be ready for Saturday\u2019s home derby against Arsenal. And yet there have been stories of an injury setback, even that he may need surgery to get to the root of his hamstring issues.\nPochettino bustled his way through those questions on Friday and the best read on James\u2019s status was that he would be back in the squad for Arsenal, most likely as a substitute. Gusto is available again after his own suspension. \u201cIt [James\u2019s hamstring] is much better,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cHe is progressing well, still not at his best, 100%. But maybe to help the team at some point \u2026. maybe, he is close to be there.\u201d\nIt has not been straightforward and it seems to remain that way. Yet there were two takeaways from Pochettino on James \u2013 with a common thread running through them. First, James could be like a coiled spring when he finally returns to action. And second, Pochettino was in no mood to criticise him for his indiscipline. On the contrary. He was happier to talk up James\u2019s passion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the business,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cHe was upset about the situation [against Villa] and then you need to understand that he is so committed to this project from the beginning. He feels really bad because he cannot help the team [because of his injury].\n\u201cHe made a mistake, we all make them and he was really sorry about it. I think he\u2019s not going to repeat the situation. This is a young guy that wants to play football. He was frustrated and he made a mistake. That\u2019s it. Finish.\u201d\nPochettino made James his captain because of \u201chis personality, his leadership, the respect he has from the club and his teammates \u2026 he has Chelsea DNA\u201d. He described him as an appointment \u201cfor the present and the future \u2013 we cannot change captain every season, every six months\u201d.\nIt is also easy to imagine that Pochettino sees something of himself in James; the self-belief, the running on the emotions of a match day. Pochettino made the point that he had got himself booked for dissent during the Burnley game. And then there is his connection with the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta; there are similarities, albeit this relationship is rather deeper, going back to their time together as players at Paris Saint-Germain.\nMauricio Pochettino said he made Reece James Chelsea captain because of \u2018his personality, his leadership, the respect he has from the club\u2019. Photograph: Darren Walsh\/Chelsea FC\/Getty Images\nThere is a reason why Pochettino calls Arteta \u201cfamily\u201d. They joined PSG at the same time, early 2001; Pochettino was 28, Arteta 18. They hit it off immediately, Pochettino wowed by Arteta\u2019s charisma and his reading of the game. \u201cAlready, he was a coach,\u201d Pochettino said, and he has no qualms with what some perceive as Arteta\u2019s histrionic touchline behaviour.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am 51 and still sometimes I feel that decisions are no good or unfair. You are competitive. Like with Mikel or myself or other coaches that played football, in our minds, we still believe we can play. Still, we have the animal instinct. We cannot be thinkers.\u201d\nFor Pochettino, it must be about channeling the emotion in the right way and not suppressing it. More broadly, he is in a better place after the wins at Fulham and Burnley, which followed the Carabao Cup victory over Brighton on the day that James was charged.\nArsenal represent an acid test of the progress and the start of a daunting run in the league; after them, Chelsea face Brentford, Tottenham, Manchester City, Newcastle, Brighton and Manchester United. Pochettino, though, pushed back against the notion that he was seeking a first statement win at the club, something to ignite his tenure. All he wants are points to drive his team up from 11th in the table.\nPochettino has appeared mired in a selection crisis since his arrival at Chelsea; James only one element of it and he will be without seven others through injury against Arsenal.\n\u201cThe moment we have all the squad at a high level and fit, we can say: \u2018OK, we are going to Arsenal, Manchester City and we are going to beat you.\u2019 At the moment, with the circumstances, I don\u2019t think this game is going to be a statement to say: \u2018Be careful, Chelsea is coming,\u2019 or something like this.\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by David Hytner, was published by The Guardian on 2023-10-20 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":109}

{"title":"Dissecting impact of Israel-Hamas conflict on markets\u00a0","context":"## Dissecting impact of Israel-Hamas conflict on markets\u00a0\n\nThe world can ill-afford another full-fledged war, when economies are already battling high inflation and interest rates, an ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and now, a slowing China. This is precisely why many countries are trying to restrict any escalation in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. The non-escaltion of the current hostilities seems to be the base case presumed by the Indian stock market presently, going by the market movement in the last week.\nThe US treasury secretary also stated that the current conflict is not likely to significantly impact global economic outlook. History too shows that the these conflicts tend to have limited impact on markets. We studied the history of conflicts between Israel and Hamas, and found that these tend to have limited impact on global financial markets, across crude oil, US 10-year yields, US equities and market volatility (see charts).\nHowever, as far as trade goes, there may be some impact. In 2022-23, Israel\u2019s share in exports from India stood at 1.87 per cent. India shipped goods around $8billion to Israel. Petroleum products account for 65 per cent of the exports, followed by gems and jewellery (15 per cent) and electrical machinery (3 per cent). Trade can be adversely impacted if operations at the Israeli ports are disrupted. Fertiliser movement from Israel\u2019s Port of Ashdod accounts for 3 per cent of global potash supply. Any disruption on this front will also be a dampener.\nBut, what if the current hostilities turn into a full-scale conflict?\nWhat supports this proposition is the fact that while there have been many conflicts between Israel and Hamas in the past decades, there have been none of this intensity. With at least 1,200 Israelis killed, this has been the biggest single-day killing of Jews since Holocaust, and Israel opposition is also united in retaliating. Israel has termed it a \u2018War\u2019, formed a war management cabinet with a key opposition member, and vowed to change the look of the \u2018Middle East\u2019.\nA massive strike by Israel in Gaza, potentially killing civilians in collateral damage, may attract more of the Middle East countries, including the de-facto leader Saudi Arabia to raise serious issues against Israel on humanitarian grounds. It will surely slow down the deal between Saudi and Israel that the US was facilitating. Besides Gaza, clashes have already been ongoing along Israel\u2019s borders with Syria and Lebanon. If Iran gets dragged into the conflict, on account of claims of funding Hamas, this could embroil the entire Middle East in crisis.\nIn this scenario, we see a major upward pressure on world inflation, on account of disruption in crude oil and world trade logistics.\nPossible disruption in crude and trade logistics\nEven before the Hamas attack, Saudi Arabia and Russia further cut oil production, in an already tight supply market. Iran is a big incremental supplier of oil, contributing 3 per cent to the global supply and any escalation risks taking energy prices higher. For security reasons, Israel has already told Chevron to shut down its offshore energy platform.\nThe Middle East crisis brings back memories of the Arab oil embargo of 1973, when OPEC cut oil to supporters of Israel. It used to account for 50 per cent of the oil production back then. Although non-OPEC production has picked up and OPEC contribution is lower at 32 per cent, it is still sizeable to take oil prices higher. A 10 per cent rise in crude price will result in global inflation being 0.4 percentage points higher next year.\nThe war may also impact Suez Canal trade, which is a key maritime route between Asia and Europe and accounts for 12 per cent of global trade by value and much larger by volume; also 5 per cent of world oil trade.\nAs things stand today, trade may not yet be impacted through the Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Oman and Iran. But a spread of the crisis to the whole Middle East can risk trade through this route, which accounts for 20 per cent of global oil trade passage. If Iran is embroiled into this conflict, then trade with landlocked Central Asia, which is a big agricultural producer, raw materials and minerals like copper, cotton, uranium, gold, natural gas, gets disrupted. Central Asia also hosts a network of road, rail, and air routes that link China, Europe, and South Asia.\nImpact on Indian markets\nIn the above scenario, supply disruption will lead to higher inflation and central bankers will have to adjust their policies and hold rates higher for longer than anticipated. We may witness a scenario where rates are held higher till the year 2025. Higher crude oil bill and higher global rates will prompt the RBI to also remain hawkish in its approach with regards to rates and liquidity measures. EBITDA margins of India Inc. may again get impacted on account of higher input costs and higher freight and fuel costs.\nRural India is a key engine that is not firing at the moment. Valuations also are rich and do not offer margin of safety in the near to medium term. Near-term attractiveness of equities will reduce, as investors will demand a higher risk premium. The Indian stock market will likely correct materially, as FIIs look to withdraw funds from risk assets and seek safe havens in US Dollar, US treasuries offering high yields and Gold.\nSectors which will be negatively impacted include Petrochemicals, Oil Marketing, Paints, Packaging, Textiles and Chemicals.\nThe writer is Group President & Head - Institutional Equities, YES Securities India\nSHARE Copy link\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nReddit\n\nThis article was published by Business Line on 2023-10-14 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":111}
{"title":"Buckle up for more \u2018turbulence\u2019 in the housing market, BofA says\u2014it\u2019s a housing recession, 1980s style","context":"## Buckle up for more \u2018turbulence\u2019 in the housing market, BofA says\u2014it\u2019s a housing recession, 1980s style\n\nHousing market pessimists have been sounding the alarm for years about a pending crash in the U.S. residential real estate market. Even before the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to fight inflation last year, pushing mortgage rates to a 23-year high this month, years of surging home prices left some experts warning that the housing market was a massive bubble ready to pop.\nHowever, despite a widely bearish outlook in the industry, most real estate veterans have avoided arguing that home prices will drop like they did during the 2008 crash that kicked off the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). And so far, that\u2019s been a wise decision.\nIt took until June 2022 for national home prices to peak, even as mortgage rates soared and purchase applications plummeted amid the Fed\u2019s first interest rate hikes. And while prices fell more than 5% from that peak by January of this year, they returned to a record high in July.\nStill, a Bank of America team led by U.S. economist Jeseo Park warned this week that there\u2019s more \u201cturbulence\u201d coming for the housing market due to high mortgage rates. They explained that they\u2019re getting an eerie feeling of \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d but it\u2019s not 2008 that is coming to mind, it\u2019s the 1980s.\n\u201cLooking back at previous housing recessions, we think the 1980s are a better analogy for today\u2019s market than the 2008 housing crash,\u201d they wrote in a Thursday note.\nThis isn\u2019t 2008\nWhile the housing crash of 2008\u2014fueled by the collapse of subprime mortgages\u2014haunts the memories of many Americans, the real estate market of that era was very different from what Bank of America\u2019s experts see today.\nPark and her team noted that there are no \u201cnoticeable signs\u201d of excess housing development today like there were back then, and households aren\u2019t nearly as burdened by mortgage debt. Household mortgage debt represented roughly 65% of U.S. consumers\u2019 disposable income in the second quarter, compared to 100% before the GFC. And the ratio of Americans\u2019 mortgage debt to their real estate assets\u2014also called loan-to-value\u2014was just 27% in the second quarter, compared to over 40% in 2008 and roughly 50% in 2010, Bank of America\u2019s data shows.\nNew legislation was also enacted since the GFC to help prevent worst-case scenarios in the housing market. One of the most obvious effects of these new laws is that there are far fewer risky adjustable-rate mortgages today. Adjustable-rate mortgages can lead to higher default rates when interest rates rise, but they now represent less than 5% of total purchase and refinance loans, compared with over 35% at the peak of the pre-GFC housing cycle.\n\u201cWe reiterate that we do not expect another housing crash like 2008,\u201d Park and her team concluded after presenting this evidence.\nIs it a repeat of the \u2018turbulence\u2019 of the 1980s?\nAccording to Bank of America, today\u2019s housing market looks a lot more like the early 1980s than it does 2008. Back then, just like today, home prices had boomed for years before Fed officials were ultimately forced to hike interest rates aggressively in an attempt to fight inflation.\nThe rise in the consumer price index peaked at around 14% in 1980 before then\u2013Fed Chair Paul Volcker\u2019s hawkish policies sent mortgage rates to 18% in a year\u2019s time, cooling inflation, but sparking a recession. This caused a serious downturn in the housing market in which home sales and building levels cratered. However, national home prices actually remained stable.\nAt the start of Volcker\u2019s term as Fed chair in August 1979, the median U.S. home sales price was $64,700. And even after a near doubling of mortgage rates, that figure rose to $69,400 by the second quarter of 1981.\nOver the past 18 months, the Fed\u2019s current chair, Jerome Powell, has been following a very similar game plan to Volcker\u2019s, raising interest rates aggressively to quash inflation. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, the most common type of mortgage in the U.S., has soared from 3.8% in March 2022 to over 7.5% today as a result. This, in turn, has slowed mortgage purchase applications and caused home sales to plummet, just as it did in the \u201980s; but home prices, echoing the dynamic of that era, have yet to collapse.\nOne of the key reasons for the resilience of the housing market in both of these periods is demographics. \u201cNoticeably, demographics were favorable back then, with baby boomers having entered the prime homebuying age,\u201d Park and her team wrote Thursday, arguing millennials are in a similar position today. \u201cSome sales activity should be supported by millennials reaching the prime homebuying age, and single-family building permits have steadily held up. This can help the housing market retain some of its momentum without falling apart.\u201d\nBank of America economists believe that low inventory of existing homes for sale combined with solid home sales to millennials could help put a \u201cfloor beneath home prices,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be some near-term pain due to higher mortgage rates.\n\u201cWith rates likely staying higher for longer, we are cautious of potential turbulence ahead,\u201d the group warned. Bank of America has previously forecast 0% home price growth and falling home sales for the full year 2023, but it didn\u2019t offer a new prediction in its latest note.\nEventually, as inflation fades leading the Fed to cut interest rates, housing affordability will improve. \u201cAt that stage, we should see a more stable and healthy housing market,\u201d Park and her team wrote. \u201cUntil then, hang tight, it may be a bumpy ride.\u201d\nThis article has been updated to correct a mistaken term used to refer to Jeseo Park. We regret the error.\n\nThis article, authored by Will Daniel, was published by Fortune on 2023-10-06 under the category 'business'.\n\n","id":112}
{"title":"2023 NFL Week 11 injury roundup: Rams WR Cooper Kupp, Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III among stars to exit","context":"## 2023 NFL Week 11 injury roundup: Rams WR Cooper Kupp, Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III among stars to exit\n\nWeek 11 of the 2023 NFL season has provided plenty of drama, from the Bears hanging with the Lions to the Giants getting a rebound from emergency quarterback Tommy DeVito. But the latest round of regular-season action has also brought another wave of unfortunate injuries. Here's a roundup of the latest big names to go down around the league:\nQB\nC.J. Stroud (Texans) left for a single play against the Cardinals after absorbing a hard hit, with backup Davis Mills entering in relief. Stroud did not receive an injury designation, however, and returned after a quick check-in from trainers.\nGeno Smith (Seahawks) suffered an injury to his throwing arm after guiding a 16-7 lead over the Rams, showing frustration while trying to stretch the arm after a hit from Aaron Donald. Seattle quickly ruled him questionable to return with an elbow issue, and backup Drew Lock took over under center with 18 seconds left in the third quarter. Smith did return, however, for the final drive of the game in the losing effort. Head coach Pete Carroll said that Smith will \"make it back.\" When asked if that means for Thursday's matchup against San Francisco, the coach said, \"I would think so.\"\nSam Howell (Commanders) received medical attention on the sidelines after enduring several hard hits to the upper body on a touchdown run against the Giants. He was quickly cleared of a potential concussion, however, and remained in the game. Veteran journeyman Jacoby Brissett is Washington's backup.\nRB\nAaron Jones (Packers) suited up against the Chargers despite a lingering hamstring issue, only to manage just five carries before suffering a knee injury. The former Pro Bowler needed help to leave the field and was then carted to the locker room, replaced by A.J. Dillon. Green Bay ruled him questionable to return, then downgraded him to out, but coach Matt LaFleur said after the Packers' win over Los Angeles that he doesn't expect the injury to be a long-term issue.\nDe'Von Achane (Dolphins) returned from injured reserve -- and a four-game absence -- but limped to the sidelines after his second touch of the first quarter against the Raiders. Miami ruled him questionable to return with a knee injury, and while he later returned to the sidelines from a locker-room visit, he was replaced on the field indefinitely by Raheem Mostert. Head coach Mike McDaniel told reporters on Monday that Achane is day-to-day. While he hasn't been ruled out of Friday's matchup with the Jets, he's not been given the green light either, so his status is worth monitoring.\nKenneth Walker III (Seahawks) took four carries against the Rams before leaving with an oblique injury. He was seen walking on the sidelines shortly afterward but ruled doubtful to return. Rookie Zach Charbonnet, who entered Week 11 with just over 200 rushing yards on the year, replaced Walker as Seattle's top ball carrier. Following the game, Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll told reporters Walker suffered an \"oblique strain that was legit\" and could miss time.\nD'Onta Foreman (Bears) remained a headliner of Chicago's backfield against the Lions, even with Khalil Herbert back from injured reserve, but managed just 14 yards on the ground before suffering an ankle injury. He walked off with a limp and attempted to run on the sidelines but did not return to the field after the Bears ruled him questionable.\nPick Six Newsletter Crafted By The Best NFL Experts Get the day's big stories + fun stuff you love like mock drafts, picks and power rankings.

Thanks for signing up! Keep an eye on your inbox. Sorry!

Hill has left multiple games this year, only to return in all of them.\nCooper Kupp (Rams) had just a single catch against the Seahawks before suffering an ankle injury while blocking. The former All-Pro, who battled a lingering hamstring injury earlier this year, received attention on the sidelines after limping off, then left the game for further evaluation in the locker room. He was ruled questionable to return. NFL Media reported on Monday that Kupp suffered a low ankle sprain and will be evaluated going forward.\nDarius Slayton (Giants) had a big impact against the Commanders, hauling in a deep score from Tommy DeVito, before exiting with an arm injury. He was ruled out for the remainder of the contest halfway through the third quarter.\nEDGE\nJoey Bosa (Chargers) appeared to injure his right leg or foot while held in a block during a first-quarter pass-rushing attempt against the Packers. He limped to the sidelines and was carted to the locker room, then ruled questionable to return.\nDB\nTalanoa Hufanga (49ers), who emerged as a ballhawk for San Francisco's secondary in 2022, left early against the Buccaneers with a knee injury. Coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed to reporters on Monday that the All-Pro suffered a season-ending ACL tear.\n\nThis article, authored by Cody Benjamin, was published by CBSSports.com on 2023-11-19 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":113}
{"title":"Fantasy Football WR PPR Rankings Week 13: Who to start, best sleepers at wide receiver","context":"## Fantasy Football WR PPR Rankings Week 13: Who to start, best sleepers at wide receiver\n\nIn the final weeks of the fantasy football regular season, rolling out a strong receiver corps comprised of wideouts set up for high usage days is every fantasy owner's goal. Having those WRs in plus matchups makes it even more likely you'll end the week in the win column. Our Week 13 fantasy WR PPR rankings can help pinpoint all the studs and sleepers at fantasy's deepest position.\nThere aren't as many studs or sleepers this week, as six byes and some inopportune injuries thin out our rankings. Nonetheless, we still have to fill out the same number of starting spots in our lineups, so those in 12-team leagues might have to dig deep to find decent WR3s and flexes. That's where we come in.\nNow that we know the backdrop to this pivotal week, let's break down our Week 13 WR rankings.\nMORE: Watch NFL RedZone live with Sling (50% off first month)\nWhich WRs are on bye in Week 13?\nWith the Ravens, Bills, Vikings, Raiders, Giants, and Bears idle in Week 13, that means Davante Adams, Stefon Diggs, Justin Jefferson, DJ Moore, Zay Flowers, Jakobi Meyers, and Jordan Addison are among the most notable wideouts omitted from our rankings. Deep-league owners will also be without Odell Beckham Jr., K.J. Osborn, Gabe Davis, Jalin Hyatt, and Khalil Shakir.\nWEEK 13 PPR RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nUnfortunately, we also won't get to pick on the poor WR defenses of the Giants and Vikings, but it's a relief to see the Ravens' shut-down secondary on the sidelines.\nWEEK 13 STANDARD RANKINGS:\nQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D\/STs | Kickers\nWho are the best fantasy WRs in Week 13?\nTyreek Hill (@ Commanders in Week 13) did his thing despite a tough matchup in Week 12, resulting in Miami's WR1 returning to the top spot against a putrid Washington stop unit. CeeDee Lamb (vs. Seahawks) isn't far behind, as Dallas' WR1 aims to maintain his efficient play against Seattle.\nAmon-Ra St. Brown (@ Saints) has been a target hog the past several weeks, seeing at least nine looks in each of his past six games. Don't expect his workload to decrease in a bounce-back game for the Lions. Keenan Allen (@ Patriots) looks to continue his dominant ways, as Justin Herbert's go-to target routinely has double-digit target potential.\nMike Evans (vs. Panthers) sits in our top five for Week 13, totaling four TDs over the past three weeks. A.J. Brown (vs. 49ers) faces a sound San Francisco coverage unit in Sunday's NFC Championship rematch, but his ability to dominate in the red zone still makes him a top-10 PPR play. Ja'Marr Chase (@ Jaguars) averaged over 20 yards per reception in Week 12, and although the drop-off from Joe Burrow to Jake Browning is massive, Chase still has WR1 upside given his usage.\nMichael Pittman Jr. (@ Texans) faces a Texans' pass defense that's been shredded the past few weeks, so another 100-yard receiving day could be in store. Jaylen Waddle (@ Commanders) is also looking to post his second consecutive 100-plus yard day, which could come to fruition against a struggling Commanders' coverage unit. Tank Dell (vs. Broncos) continues to rise up our PPR rankings, rounding out our top 10 as a trusted option of C.J. Stroud's.\nWEEK 13 FANTASY ADVICE: Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit\nWho are the best fantasy WR sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 13?\nCurtis Samuel (vs. Dolphins), Jayden Reed (vs. Chiefs), Lynn Bowden Jr. (vs. Lions), Jonathan Mingo (@ Buccaneers), Cedric Tillman (@ Rams), and DeVante Parker (vs. Chargers) profile as this week's crop of sleepers and waiver-wire adds.\nSamuel saw a heavy dosage of targets in Week 12, and with Washington passing at a high clip, another high-usage day could be in store. Reed's scored in three straight games and while he has a higher ceiling in standard formats, he still has flex appeal in a potentially negative game script.\nBowden Jr., alongside A.T. Perry and Keith Kirkwood, are the only healthy Saints WRs right now, and a favorable matchup against Detroit gives each some flex value in deep leagues. Mingo also draws a plus matchup against a reeling Buccaneers secondary, as a potential negative game script should boost his Week 13 fantasy ceiling.\nTillman is another talented rookie who's getting more run as the season progresses, and although P.J. Walker's struggled under center, Tillman is set up for a high-usage day against the Rams with Amari Cooper (ribs) banged up.\nWEEK 13 DFS:\nDK lineup | FD lineup | Best stacks | Best values\nWho are the biggest potential WR busts in Week 13?\nBeware of Terry McLaurin (vs. Dolphins), Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell (vs. Browns), Drake London (@ Jets), and Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (@ Cowboys) this week.\nMcLaurin's averaging just 42 receiving yards over his past three games, and a heavy dosage of Jalen Ramsey hinders his Week 13 fantasy value.\nNacua and Atwell see a Cleveland coverage unit who entered Week 12 allowing the fewest fantasy points per game to WRs. Heck, even Cooper Kupp, who hasn't looked like himself of late, could underperform again.\nWe can't trust London and the rest of the Falcons passing offense against a well-rounded Jets defense. To make matters worse, he'll be matched up against Sauce Gardner for most of the day, too.\nLockett and Smith-Njigba might be better suited for the bench in PPR leagues against a lockdown Dallas coverage unit. Geno Smith's struggles complicate their fantasy prospects, as well.\nWhat are the biggest WR injuries in Week 13?\nEntering Week 12, Tee Higgins (hamstring), Noah Brown (knee), Treylon Burks (concussion), and Kadarius Toney (ankle, hip) all failed to suit up due to nagging injuries. For now, we've placed Higgins and Brown in our Week 13 list and omitted Burks and Toney. We'll also be eyeing the Chargers' Josh Palmer (knee), who's eligible to come off the IR this week but probably won't suit up against New England.\nLast week, the most notable WRs to exit their respective games with injuries include Chris Olave (concussion), Amari Cooper (ribs), Demario Douglas (concussion), and Rashid Shaheed (thigh). We've left all four WRs out of our initial Week 13 list but will closely monitor their teams' injury reports to gauge their playing prospects.\nAs usual, we'll update these WR PPR rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.\nFantasy WR PPR Rankings Week 13: Who to start, sit at wide receiver\nRankings based on PPR scoring formats\nRank Player\n1 Tyreek Hill, Dolphins @ Commanders\n2 CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys vs. Seahawks\n3 Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions @ Saints\n4 Keenan Allen, Chargers @ Patriots\n5 Mike Evans, Buccaneers vs. Panthers\n6 A.J.

{"title":"The people who ruined the internet","context":"## The people who ruined the internet\n\nThe alligator got my attention. Which, of course, was the point. When you hear that a 10-foot alligator is going to be released at a rooftop bar in South Florida, at a party for the people being accused of ruining the internet, you can\u2019t quite stop yourself from being curious. If it was a link \u2014 \u201cWATCH: 10-foot Gator Prepares to Maul Digital Marketers\u201d \u2014 I would have clicked. But it was an IRL opportunity to meet the professionals who specialize in this kind of gimmick, the people turning online life into what one tech writer recently called a \u201csearch-optimized hellhole.\u201d So I booked a plane ticket to the Sunshine State.\nI wanted to understand: what kind of human spends their days exploiting our dumbest impulses for traffic and profit? Who the hell are these people making money off of everyone else\u2019s misery?\nAfter all, a lot of folks are unhappy, in 2023, with their ability to find information on the internet, which, for almost everyone, means the quality of Google Search results. The links that pop up when they go looking for answers online, they say, are \u201cabsolutely unusable\u201d; \u201cgarbage\u201d; and \u201ca nightmare\u201d because \u201ca lot of the content doesn\u2019t feel authentic.\u201d Some blame Google itself, asserting that an all-powerful, all-seeing, trillion-dollar corporation with a 90 percent market share for online search is corrupting our access to the truth. But others blame the people I wanted to see in Florida, the ones who engage in the mysterious art of search engine optimization, or SEO.\nDoing SEO is less straightforward than buying the advertising space labeled \u201cSponsored\u201d above organic search results; it\u2019s more like the Wizard of Oz projecting his voice to magnify his authority. The goal is to tell the algorithm whatever it needs to hear for a site to appear as high up as possible in search results, leveraging Google\u2019s supposed objectivity to lure people in and then, usually, show them some kind of advertising. Voil\u00e0: a business model! Over time, SEO techniques have spread and become insidious, such that googling anything can now feel like looking up \u201csneaker\u201d in the dictionary and finding a definition that sounds both incorrect and suspiciously as though it were written by someone promoting Nike (\u201cfootwear that allows you to just do it!\u201d). Perhaps this is why nearly everyone hates SEO and the people who do it for a living: the practice seems to have successfully destroyed the illusion that the internet was ever about anything other than selling stuff.\nSo who ends up with a career in SEO? The stereotype is that of a hustler: a content goblin willing to eschew rules, morals, and good taste in exchange for eyeballs and mountains of cash. A nihilist in it for the thrills, a prankster gleeful about getting away with something.\n\u201cThis is modern-day pirate shit, as close as you can get,\u201d explained Cade Lee, who prepared me over the phone for what to expect in Florida based on over a decade working in SEO. What Lee said he\u2019s noticed most at SEO conferences and SEO networking events is a certain arrogance. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely an ego among all of them,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou succeed, and now you\u2019re a genius. Now you\u2019ve outdone Google.\u201d\nThe more I thought about search engine optimization and how a bunch of megalomaniacal jerks were degrading our collective sense of reality because they wanted to buy Lamborghinis and prove they could vanquish the almighty algorithm \u2014 which, technically, constitutes many algorithms, but we think of as a single force \u2014 the more I looked forward to going to Florida for this alligator party. Maybe, I thought, I would get to see someone who made millions clogging the internet with bullshit get the ultimate comeuppance. Maybe an SEO professional would get attacked by a gigantic, prehistoric-looking reptile right there in front of me. Maybe I could even repackage such a tragedy into a sensationalized anecdote for a viral article about the people who do SEO for a living, strongly implying that nature was here to punish the bad guy while somehow also assuming the ethical high ground and pretending I hadn\u2019t been hoping this exact thing would happen from the start.\nBecause I, too, use Google. I, too, want reliable and relevant things to come up when I look through this vast compendium of human knowledge. And I, too, enjoy the sweet taste of revenge.\nThe first thing that went wrong at the alligator party was the alligator was only five and a half feet long, not 10 feet, as advertised. Classic clickbait!\nThe second thing that went wrong at the alligator party was that I found almost everyone I met to be sympathetic, or at least nice enough not to want to see them get maimed by a five-and-a-half-foot alligator. My harshest assessment of the 200 digital marketers taking shots and swaying to a dancehall reggae band was that they dressed like they lived in Florida, which almost all of them did.\nTake Missy Ward, a blonde in an orange bandage dress so tight she told me she couldn\u2019t take full steps. She laughed as she explained that she\u2019d ordered the dress on Amazon and hadn\u2019t tried it on until the day of the alligator party. Ward had a feisty, wry energy that made me want to root for her. When she started doing SEO in 1998, she said, it was \u201cfive girls and all dudes.\u201d She eventually sold her company for $40 million. Somehow, in the moment, I was psyched to hear this. She was being so patient, explaining the history of SEO and suggesting other people for me to reach out to. I should really go talk with that guy across the room, who had a long-running podcast about SEO, she said, the one in the sky blue polo.\nHis name was Daron Babin, and I quickly learned he was just the kind of \u201cmodern-day pirate shit\u201d guy I\u2019d been warned about: thrilled at the opportunity to recount the brilliant trickery that had allowed him to line his pockets. His SEO career got going in 1994, before Google even existed. \u201cThe air of manipulation was insane,\u201d Babin told me. \u201cWe had this weird community of geeks and nerds, and we all talked to each other about how we were beating the algorithms up,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were trying to outrank other people just for bragging rights.\u201d\nWe were chatting on a patio overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, between the buffet and the band, when the host of the alligator party, Darren Blatt, came up to say how glad he was that I\u2019d found Daron Babin.\n\u201cIt was like I won the lottery, and I didn\u2019t know how long it would last.\u201d\nDarren and Daron (pronounced the same way) have been friends for decades, since the era when Darren \u201cD-Money\u201d Blatt would throw rap star-studded internet marketing shindigs during the Adult Video News Awards in Vegas, back when sex sites were among the most advanced in technology, and Daron Babin was using SEO to promote offshore casinos and Viagra (\u201cWe were outranking Pfizer!\u201d). Together, Darren and Daron managed to milk all three of the early online cash cows: porn, pills, and gambling.\nAs the internet became more regulated and mainstream, around the turn of the century, Darren noticed Daron\u2019s SEO skills were increasingly in demand. \u201cI told him that he was missing the boat, that he needed to be a consultant and charge a few grand,\u201d Darren said.\nDaron took the advice, asking for $2,000 a day, and watched his career explode. \u201cI would wake up in a city and not know what time zone I was in,\u201d he recalled. To slow the pace, he upped it to $5,000 a day, but \u201cit seemed the more I raised my rates, the more gigs I was getting.\u201d\nNowadays, he mostly invests in cannabis and psychedelics. SEO just got to be too complicated for not enough money, he told me. Ward had told me the same thing, that she had stopped focusing on SEO years ago.\nI was considering how it was possible that so many people have been complaining recently about SEO ruining the internet if these people were telling me the SEO business is in decline when I met Jairo Bastilla. He was the kind of tall, charming man who described himself multiple times as \u201ca nerd,\u201d and he pointed out that even though working directly with search engine rankings is \u201cno longer monetizing at the highest payout,\u201d the same \u201ccore knowledge of SEO\u201d remains relevant for everything from native advertising to social media.\nTranslation? SEO is now baked into everything. Bastilla, for example, specializes in email campaigns, which he called \u201cdeliverability.\u201d\nAs a person who militantly unsubscribes to any and all marketing emails, I suddenly felt claustrophobic, surrounded by people who annoy the rest of us for a living. Why does it always seem to surprise me, even after all these years, that the way we behave on the internet is often quite different from how we act in real life?\nI wandered off to wait in line for a drink, where I noticed several people nonchalantly making space in a corner, as if to move out of the way for a bartender carrying empty glasses. There, squirming along the ground, was the alligator himself, wagging his tail, snout held shut by a thin strip of electrical tape. His handler was nowhere in sight. It was an unsettling vision, a predator pretending to be just another party guest.\n\u201cThey should untape the mouth!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cI\u2019m not even scared.\u201d\nAs sunset turned to dusk, I found Daron Babin again, and he started telling me about one of his signature moves, back in the \u201990s, involving fake domain names: \u201cI could make it look like it was somebody else, but it actually redirected to me!\u201d What he and his competitors did was legal but well beyond what the dominant search engine allowed. He never faced any consequences, but in the end, internet users at large felt the effects: \u201cIt muddied up Yahoo, ultimately,\u201d he said, \u201cbut while it worked, we banked.\u201d\nThe situation sounded familiar. But I liked Babin. He was funny and smart, a keen observer of the SEO world. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a very weird time, technologically, with AI, from an optimization standpoint,\u201d he told me. Anyone who thought the internet was already saturated with SEO-oriented content should buckle up.\n\u201cAll the assholes that are out there paying shitty link-building companies to build shitty articles,\u201d he said, \u201cnow they can go and use the free version of GPT.\u201d Soon, he said, Google results would be even worse, dominated entirely by AI-generated crap designed to please the algorithms, produced and published at volumes far beyond anything humans could create, far beyond anything we\u2019d ever seen before.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not gonna be able to stop the onslaught of it,\u201d he said. Then he laughed and laughed, thinking about how puny and irrelevant Google seemed in comparison to the next generation of automated SEO. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop it!\u201d\nOnce I was safe at home, my alligator attack bluster having deflated into an irrepressible affection for clever scoundrels, mixed with fear about the future promised by said scoundrels, I decided to seek a broader range of the people who do SEO for a living. Perhaps the ones who live in Florida were simply too, well, Florida, and the ones who live elsewhere might be more principled? An old contact heard I was writing about SEO and suggested I find a man he called Legendary Lars: \u201cHe was an absolute god in that space.\u201d\nI tracked down Lars Mapstead in Northern California, where he was preparing to run for president in 2024 as a Libertarian. Mapstead spent the first two years of his life in a Volkswagen van traveling the Pacific coast before his hippie parents settled on a Big Sur property with goats, chickens, and no electricity. He became a tinkerer and an autodidact, the guy who reads the instruction manual and fixes everything himself. When he first heard about the World Wide Web, it was 1993, and he was working for a company selling computer motherboards.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the freedom of information!\u201d he remembered thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s all just about collaborating and bettering mankind!\u201d\nHe learned how to build a website and then how to submit a site to be listed in early search directories like AltaVista, WebCrawler, Infoseek, and Lycos. He learned how to create chat rooms, attracting people spread across the globe, all alone in their homes but together online. It was beautiful. It was exciting. Mapstead saw himself as an explorer in a small but finite kingdom. \u201cI had surfed the entire internet. There wasn\u2019t a page I hadn\u2019t seen.\u201d\nAnd then, one day, a company in New York offered to pay him $2,000 a month to put banner ads on one of his websites, and everything changed. More clicks meant more ad dollars. Higher search engine rankings meant more clicks. So whatever it took to get a higher ranking, he learned how to do. He bought photographs of women in bikinis and made a 60-page slideshow with banner ads on each page. He realized that most search engines were just listing websites in order of how many times a search term appeared on the site and in its tags, so he focused on stuffing his sites with keywords, resubmitting his URL to the search engines, and waiting for the results to change.\nMapstead started pulling in $25,000\u2013$30,000 a month, working 12- to 14-hour days. \u201cIt was how long could I stay awake and how little life could I have because this was more money than I could have ever imagined in my lifetime,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was like I won the lottery, and I didn\u2019t know how long it would last.\u201d\nAround this time, in 1997, an Italian professor published a journal article about what he called Search Engines Persuasion. \u201cFinding the right information on the World Wide Web is becoming a fundamental problem,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA vast number of new companies was born just to make customer Web pages as visible as possible,\u201d which \u201chas led to a bad performance degradation of search engines.\u201d\nEnter Google. The company revolutionized search by evaluating websites based on links from other websites, seeing each link as a vote of relevance and trustworthiness. The founders pledged to be a neutral navigation system with no ads: just a clean white screen with a search box that would bring people off of the Google landing page and out to a helpful website as seamlessly as possible. Users quickly decided this link-based sorting methodology was superior to the existing search engines, and by the end of 1999, Google was handling the majority of online queries.\n\u201cI was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month.\u201d\nMapstead, like many of the early practitioners of SEO, figured out how to adapt. Almost as soon as Google took over, a secondary market emerged for links. For a few hundred bucks, a firm in India or the Philippines could provide thousands of links from blog networks built entirely for that purpose. It was easy: buy links that led to your site and watch your ranking in Google\u2019s results rise.\nI came to understand that, since the dawn of the internet, there have been people attempting to manipulate search and then people decrying those manipulations as the end of search\u2019s ability to be useful. It works in cycles. People doing SEO find loopholes in the algorithm; critics complain about search results; search engines innovate and close the loopholes. Rinse, repeat.\nBefore our current moment of widespread disillusionment with online information, the rise of SEO had reached a breaking point multiple times. In 2003, as Google approached the deadline to disclose pertinent business information leading up to its IPO, the company quietly released an update cracking down. By 2011, SEO was once again oppressively pervasive. TechCrunch published a story called \u201cWhy We Desperately Need a New (and Better) Google,\u201d which argued that \u201cGoogle has become a jungle: a tropical paradise for spammers and marketers.\u201d In the next year, Google made two major changes to the algorithm, which came to be called Panda and Penguin.\nWhile the public might have experienced each of these updates as a relief, Mapstead and his SEO compatriots saw them as devastating. \u201cThey change the rules instantly overnight, and then you\u2019re out of business,\u201d he told me. \u201cHere you\u2019re trying to rely on this business model to feed yourself and your family, and they\u2019re pulling the rug from underneath you, and you\u2019ve gotta scramble to pay rent.\u201d\nBut don\u2019t worry about Mapstead. This is a guy seemingly blessed with a never-ending mental stream of schemes. He helped start a handful of companies, including the once-ubiquitous hookup site AdultFriendFinder, which sold in 2007 for $500 million. He tried to retire after that but got bored and started a couple of Facebook pages devoted to his passion for hot rods and custom cars. This was during the peak years for social media, and just as Bastilla had described back at the alligator party, Mapstead\u2019s \u201ccore knowledge of SEO\u201d came in handy. Before long, his pages had 25 million followers. \u201cI was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd that was supposed to be my hobby!\u201d\nAs I spoke with more SEO professionals around the country, I began to think that the reason I found them endearing and not evil was that while many had made quite a bit of money, almost none had amassed significant power. Unlike the Elon Musks and Jeff Bezoses of the world, who went from geeky teenagers to masters of the universe, the dorks who grew up to do SEO have stayed the butt of the joke, beholden to the fluctuations of the algorithm, frantically pulling levers behind the scenes but ultimately somewhat hapless.\nI mean, have I even mentioned that they call themselves \u201cSEOs\u201d? Really. They say things like, \u201cAs the SEO, my job is to get more traffic.\u201d This title feels thirsty to be seen as similar to a CEO, to be taken seriously. And compared to the rest of the tech world, SEO has always lacked a certain glamor or a certain messiah complex. Case in point: while many of the tech CEOs claiming to save the world these days live in Miami, the alligator party was an hour up the coast in Fort Lauderdale.\n\u201cThe SEO people are just trying to make money,\u201d said Peter Kent, the author of several dozen explanatory tech books, including SEO for Dummies and Bitcoin for Dummies. \u201cThe cryptocurrency people are trying to make money, but they\u2019re also trying to overthrow, you know, the existing system.\u201d\nKent has done his fair share of SEO jobs but also has something of an outsider\u2019s perspective. For years, he\u2019s been telling people that part of the SEO industry\u2019s reputation problem is that 80 percent of SEOs are scammers.\n\u201cA lot of companies and individuals out there selling their services as SEO gurus don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing or don\u2019t really give a damn,\u201d he explained. As a consultant, he\u2019s often had businesses ask him to vet the work of other SEOs. \u201cI would take a look at their site and determine the firm had done next to nothing and had been charging thousands a month for years on end.\u201d\nWhen I ran this 80 percent scam figure by other SEOs, most agreed it sounded accurate, though people were divided about what to ascribe to greed and what was just stupidity.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t because they have a scammer\u2019s heart,\u201d said Bruce Clay. \u201cIt\u2019s because they don\u2019t have the real expertise.\u201d Clay is an avuncular man with a mustache who is often credited with coining the phrase \u201csearch engine optimization\u201d and is therefore called \u201cthe father of SEO.\u201d He told me his agency never hires an SEO with less than a decade of experience.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can trust anything you read online.\u201d\nThough Google publishes guidelines explaining how to do better in search (\u201cMake your site interesting and useful\u201d), the exact formula for how and why one website gets placed over another is top secret, meaning that SEO involves a lot of reverse engineering and guesswork. With no clear chain of cause and effect around why a site\u2019s ranking has changed, a less talented practitioner can take on the mien of a premodern farmer, struggling to figure out how to make it rain. Should he do that dance he did last year the night before it poured? Or maybe sacrifice his firstborn?\nThe algorithm is just too opaque, too complicated, and too dynamic, making it easy for scammy SEOs to pretend they know what they\u2019re doing and difficult for outsiders to sort the good SEOs from the bad. To make things even more confusing for, say, a small business looking to hire someone to improve their Google ranking, even a talented SEO might need a year of work to make a difference, perhaps implying a good SEO was a scammer when in fact, the client was just being impatient or refusing to implement essential advice. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of effort that\u2019s required to do things to move the needle, and a lot of companies aren\u2019t willing to put out the money for that, even though it may be worthwhile in the long run,\u201d said John Heard, a longtime SEO based in Kansas.\nOf course, some people bristled at the very suggestion that the industry is filled with con artists. \u201cThere are a lot of scammers in every single business. It\u2019s just easier to call yourself an SEO than a doctor,\u201d said Barry Schwartz. Schwartz is an unbelievably fast talker and a prolific writer who has spent the past two decades covering SEO for the trade rag Search Engine Land. Both over the phone with me and in his work, he has defended SEO as a legitimate, dignified pursuit: \u201cThe search community is filled with hard-working individuals working to help their clients\u2019 websites succeed in Google Search. That success is not done through dark, corrupt or shady tactics but rather hard, smart and thorough work.\u201d\nSeveral people that I spoke to made a similar point: the best SEOs are the ones that follow Google\u2019s rules, which essentially ask you to make amazing websites without even thinking about Google. You are not supposed to make any attempt to artificially boost a website\u2019s ranking; you are supposed to be designing websites for human readers, not for the algorithm. And many SEOs do exactly this kind of work: rewriting copy, making a site load more quickly, etc. But the existence of good SEOs does not negate the presence of scammers and idiots and people who get ahead by violating Google\u2019s terms of service, just as the mild-mannered teacher\u2019s pet in a classroom does not negate the obnoxious shouting of the kids that refuse to behave. A few loud kids can easily drown everyone else out.\nEven Schwartz acknowledged the effect that the rule-breaking SEOs have had on the internet experience. We get to talking about the types of small businesses that are particularly lucrative customers for SEOs, including lawyers, accountants, and contractors, because these are the professions eager for attention from all the people going online to find local recommendations. If Schwartz himself had to hire a reliable attorney, I asked, what would be the best way to do so?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can trust anything you read online,\u201d he told me. \u201cMaybe you ask a friend.\u201d\nAfter hearing so much about what it was like to be an SEO, I decided it was time to better understand what\u2019s been going on from the perspective of the search engine. Google was slow to allow someone to talk with me, possibly because of the giant PR clusterfuck that has been the company\u2019s past year (accused by the federal government of being a monopoly; increasingly despised by the public; losing ground to Reddit, TikTok, and large language models), so I decided to start by meeting up with a chipper, charismatic man named Duane Forrester.\nForrester was at Microsoft from 2007 until 2015, where he helped launch and manage Bing, the perpetual underdog to Google\u2019s domination of online search. Before and after his time at Microsoft, Forrester worked as an SEO, so he sees the industry from both sides, like an aerospace engineer who spent a few years at the Department of Defense, left for the private sector, and now is much better at winning military contracts. Forrester has a holistic understanding of the delicate push and pull between the SEOs desperate for clues on how to do their jobs better and the search engine trying to keep its secret-sauce algorithm proprietary. He also knows a huge range of people in the industry. Like Schwartz, he wanted to emphasize how hard everyone works. \u201cI\u2019ve lost track of how many people I know who built companies and sold them and have just, like, made wealth,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat is not a 40-hour commitment in the week. That is a 400-hour commitment.\u201d (For the record, there are 168 hours in a week.)\nThese days, Forrester lives in Los Angeles, and he asked me to meet him at one of his favorite restaurants, which felt like a British pub operated by Disney World, tucked away in a desert strip mall. Inside, every inch was covered in Anglophile paraphernalia, including Union Jack flags, a mural of Big Ben, and a red phone booth. Over a full English breakfast, he told me about growing up in rural Canada, where his parents owned a motel. As a kid, he used to mess around with the pay phone outside, eventually figuring out how to finagle free long-distance phone calls. \u201cAnd then it became, \u2018What else can I know how to do?\u2019\u201d\nBy the \u201990s, Forrester was trading tips with other SEOs in online forums. He still remembers the thrill of the very first SEO conference he went to, where he was asked to speak. \u201cThe people who got up onstage to talk were seen as somehow more knowledgeable, but I don\u2019t know that we felt that way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou all kind of knew you were making shit up.\u201d\nAfter years of being friends online, the SEOs were eager to let loose in person, giving off what Forrester described as \u201cthat vibe of a lot of young people with access to a lot of money. And it was like, no expenses spared in New York City.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d\nFor Forrester, it was the start of a long career of keynote presentations and consummate schmoozing \u2014 Clay, the father of SEO, described him to me as \u201ca cruise director\u201d on the SS SEO. The conference circuit has treated Forrester well. He\u2019s attended events in Napa, Hawaii, and Barbados, among many others, as well as \u201can infinite number of private dinners and these types of things in every city you can think of, at the most lavish restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve lost track of how many Michelin-starred meals I\u2019ve had, \u2019cause it\u2019s now in the dozens, from my time in this industry. And I\u2019m not going to say no to the dinner that everyone\u2019s going to, that one company is sponsoring because it\u2019s a thank you to everybody who contributed to, whatever it was, you know? And you go and everybody has a good time. You talk about the industry, and that\u2019s it. And it becomes the stuff of legends.\u201d\nOver the years, he\u2019s seen it all. He remembered \u201cwalking into hotel rooms and it\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the morning, there\u2019s drugs and alcohol and everything everywhere, and there\u2019s a party going on.\u201d Forrester marveled at the audacity of his fellow SEOs. \u201cSomebody showed up and brought her Aston Martin to a conference and parked it at the front door. Immediately got a parking ticket.\u201d He suggested she might want to relocate the car before it got towed, but the woman told him she would just move it to the next parking spot and get another ticket. \u201cShe goes, \u2018It\u2019s cheaper for me to leave the car parked out front and use it as a way to start conversations with potential clients than it is for me to rent a suite at the hotel and get people to go to the suite to have the same conversation.\u2019\u201d Then, she offered to take Forrester for a joyride around Seattle. Obviously, he said yes.\nOnce he represented Bing, Forrester more or less stopped drinking at conferences, as had long been the case for his counterpart at Google, an engineer named Matt Cutts, who helped build and then ran the company\u2019s web spam team before stepping back in 2014 and leaving in 2016.\nCutts was a celebrity among SEOs, constantly mobbed with questions and complaints. When we spoke on the phone, he told me that before he left, he determined that he had sent about 50,000 emails to people outside of Google during his decade and a half at the company.\nSeveral SEOs described trying to get Cutts to drink at conferences so he would \u201cspill secrets,\u201d as one put it, but what generally ended up happening was that all the SEOs would get drunk instead. Meanwhile, Cutts would stay sober, jotting down the latest SEO methods on a small notepad, sitting quietly in the corner at the bar.\n\u201cMy favorite question to ask an SEO,\u201d Cutts told me, was, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d which prompted responses that felt like \u201ca cross between showing off and a confessional.\u201d So many SEOs were tempted to reveal the vulnerabilities they\u2019d discovered in Google\u2019s algorithms, even when they were talking to the one person they really shouldn\u2019t have been talking to, the guy who was planning to go back to his office and make those vulnerabilities disappear.\nAs a former SEO himself, Forrester understood that the quality of Bing\u2019s search results would be impacted by the work of SEOs, so it made sense to communicate with SEOs as much as possible. Cutts similarly tried to serve as a conduit between SEOs and Google, but Forrester felt that Google projected an attitude he described as: \u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing, we will stop your attempts to game this, and you know what? We\u2019ll just kind of ignore you, and when you give us feedback, eh, we don\u2019t really care.\u201d\nCutts, as an individual, seemed to be doing his best within an expanding corporate behemoth to remain approachable. \u201cOne thing I learned early on was that even when someone was shouting at you, there\u2019s a kernel of something you needed to hear in the other person and listen to and respect and integrate and incorporate,\u201d he told me. Most SEOs told me they appreciated his efforts. When Google released the 2011 Panda update that devastated a generation of SEO businesses, Cutts openly recognized the impossible task of achieving the kind of epistemological neutrality that Google\u2019s founders had initially promised, telling Wired at the time, \u201c[T]he only way to be neutral is either to randomize the links or to do it alphabetically.\u201d\nStill, some blamed him personally for \u201ckilling\u201d companies that had relied on the previous iteration of the algorithm. During his time at Google, Cutts regularly received death threats and hate mail. When SEOs would send, say, a fruit plate or a brownie cake addressed to him at Google\u2019s offices, he told me, \u201cWe\u2019d take it down to the kitchen with a note warning: possibly poisoned.\u201d\nAfter Cutts left, Google replaced him with a handful of people, none of whom could quite fill his shoes: \u201cThose personalities sometimes were standoffish,\u201d Forrester told me. \u201cSome of them were superior. Some of them were a bit too wallflower.\u201d\nOne of the people Google brought in was Danny Sullivan, a former journalist who started Search Engine Land, the industry publication where Schwartz works, back in the 2000s. In 2009, Sullivan was described as \u201cthe closest approximation to an umpire in the search world,\u201d so when he published \u201cA deep look at Google\u2019s biggest-ever search quality crisis\u201d in 2017 and then took a job as Google\u2019s public liaison for Search only a few months later, it felt to some SEOs as though a congressperson working on gun safety legislation had quit to become an NRA lobbyist.\n\u201cThere is a thread across the industry of people who believe that Google just made Danny an offer he couldn\u2019t say no to, and it was designed essentially to take his voice out of the conversation,\u201d Forrester told me. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case,\u201d he went on, but compared to Cutts, \u201cI think that Danny specifically stays out of a lot of public conversations because he is in those private conversations with businesses.\u201d\nWas all that really Google\u2019s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it.\nWhen I finally manage to jump through the flaming rings necessary to be allowed to speak on the phone with Sullivan, albeit with a communications chaperone also on the line, I find him angry and defensive. He\u2019s annoyed that anyone would think his era at Google has been less transparent than Cutts\u2019 was: \u201cWe have reams of help documents!\u201d he told me. \u201cWe have more people assigned to work with SEOs than we did when Matt worked here!\u201d\nSullivan is mad that the public and the media don\u2019t really understand what he considers to be basic precepts about how search works, leading him to adopt a rather scolding tone online. He\u2019s frustrated that people want to know every last detail about Google\u2019s algorithm because even \u201cif we listed all one thousand of the ranking signals\u201d and how much each was worth, he said, that wouldn\u2019t actually help SEOs do their jobs better, anyway.\nAnd most of all, Sullivan is pissed that people think Google results have gone downhill. Because they haven\u2019t, he insisted. If anything, search results have gotten a lot better over time. Anyone who thought search quality was worse needed to take a hard look in the mirror.\n\u201cWe have an entire generation that grew up expecting the search box to do the work for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might do a better job of matching for a bulk of people, but for people who are super sensitive, when they have that fail moment, now it becomes, \u2018All my searches aren\u2019t good.\u2019\u201d\nThe problem was not Google. The problem was not SEOs. The problem was kids these days.\nOf course Sullivan would say this, though. He works for Google. I felt like I began to understand why many SEOs had told me that Cutts\u2019 departure had marked a major turning point in the history of the internet, emblematic of Google\u2019s transition from idealistic startup to one of the most valuable and powerful companies to ever exist. Over the phone, Cutts came off as humble and thoughtful, acknowledging the nuances and challenges of the search engine business, while Sullivan sounded like an impatient corporate stooge, trying to gaslight me into believing the sky was red.\nBut here\u2019s the part where I started to feel the way I\u2019ve felt so often in recent years, like I was losing my grip on reality: Sullivan was not the only person who tried to tell me that search results have improved significantly. Out of the dozen-plus SEOs that I spoke with at length, nearly every single one insisted that search results are way better than they used to be. And except for Sullivan, these were not people with an incentive to praise Google. If anything, these were folks who lamented how much harder it had become for them to take advantage of Google. Today, they told me, search results are just objectively more accurate. More useful. More difficult to manipulate.\nThis was not what I had been noticing, and this was certainly not what I had been hearing from friends and journalists and friends who are journalists. Were all of us wrong? Or engulfed in some kind of Baader\u2013Meinhof frequency bias delusion? Had I been researching a nonexistent problem? Were Google results actually amazing? Truly, I had lost the plot. Was the premise of this piece completely off? Was I the asshole who deserved to be attacked by an alligator?\nI began to worry all the people who were mad about search results were upset about something that had nothing to do with metrics and everything to do with feelings and ~vibes~ and a universal, non-Google-specific resentment and rage about how the internet has made our lives so much worse in so many ways, dividing us and deceiving us and provoking us and making us sadder and lonelier. Decades of American optimism about the wonderful potential of technology, from the Moon landing to personal computers to the iPhone, had finally, in the last few years, broken down into comprehensive chagrin at the petty, pathetic, and violent world enabled by our devices. Was all that really Google\u2019s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it. To muddy it up, as Babin had put it, but while it worked, to make as much fucking money as possible.\nThe person who helped me snap out of my confusion spiral was an SEO named Lily Ray. Ray is a 30-something jet-setter with black-line tattoos and an asymmetrical, dyed blonde pixie cut. I managed to catch her for lunch in Brooklyn between speaking gigs in Chicago and Berlin on a day when she was also simultaneously managing a 35-person team at her digital marketing agency, posting multiple times an hour on social media, dog-sitting for a Pomeranian whose \u201cdaddies\u201d were at Burning Man, caring for her own mini Australian shepherd, and organizing the house party she was hosting that weekend \u2014 a party she expected to be late for because she first had to drop by a rooftop to perform a DJ set at a different party.\nRay reassured me that I was not crazy. Google results today do feel different from how they felt just five or six years ago for two major reasons. The first was Google\u2019s response to the disinformation panic around the 2016 election, which involved questioning the notion that the most reliable information could be chosen by a form of popularity, meaning how many links a site received from other sites. As a result, the algorithm seemed to change its approach to links, especially when it came to news and sites offering legal, financial, or health advice, and instead paid more attention to what Google came to call E-E-A-T: experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.\n\u201cE-E-A-T has had a pretty big impact on what types of results you see,\u201d Ray told me. She\u2019s done extensive (and fascinating) research around how certain sites have fared under these new guidelines: Urban Dictionary, down! Mayo Clinic, up! Some people consider EEAT part of what\u2019s making results better than ever. Others see it as a form of censorship, disproportionately affecting right-wing perspectives. Not every search query takes EEAT into account; Google has described heightened concern over sites that could impact safety, happiness, and the ability to be an informed citizen. But the point that really hit me was that for certain kinds of information, Google had undone one of the fundamental elements of what had made its results so appealing from the start. Now, instead of wild-west crowdsourcing, search was often reinforcing institutional authority.\nYou can\u2019t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at\nThis felt complicated at best. When it comes to health and wellness, for example, quackery is often in the eye of the beholder. Everyone knows someone who has struggled with the limits of Western medicine. So much of the original draw of the internet was the opportunity for outlier voices to be heard alongside established experts and elites. Looking back on all that had changed around what first attracted people to Google, from the introduction of ads to the efforts to keep users within the universe of Google products, this seemed to be the last straw.\nThe second major reason why Google results feel different lately was, of course, SEO \u2014 specifically, the obnoxious-kid-refusing-to-behave-in-class kind of SEO.\n\u201cSEO that goes against Google\u2019s guidelines, it\u2019s not new,\u201d Ray explained. A decade ago, it used to be called \u201cblack hat\u201d SEO, in comparison to the search engine-approved \u201cwhite hat\u201d tactics. And Google has, as Sullivan and many SEOs told me, gotten better over time at catching SEOs playing tricks on the algorithm. Although many of us may have rosy memories of how magical and cool Google seemed in the early days, most SEOs consider the years between 2003 and 2011 to be the boom times, when you could still get a fake corporate website listed above the real corporate website, and you could mess with the search results for a major political figure such that something sexual or racist would come up first.\nGoogle is harder to game now \u2014 it\u2019s true. But the sheer volume of SEO bait being produced is so massive and so complex that Google is overwhelmed. \u201cIt\u2019s exponentially worse,\u201d Ray said. \u201cPeople can mass auto-generate content with AI and other tools,\u201d she went on, and \u201cin many cases, Google\u2019s algorithms take a minute to catch onto it.\u201d\nThe future that Babin had cackled about at the alligator party was already here. We humans and our pedestrian questions were getting caught up in a war of robots fighting robots, of Google\u2019s algorithms trying to find and stop the AI-enabled sites programmed by SEOs from infecting our internet experience.\nEventually, a site filled with computer-generated nonsense designed to maximize SEO will get removed from search results, Ray explained, but while it\u2019s up, the creator might make as much as $50,000 or $100,000 a month. A lot of the people who did this, she said, live cheaply overseas in places like Bali and Chiang Mai. \u201dThey make a bunch of money, that site dies, and they go do it again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a churn and burn strategy. So if people are seeing those results, it can be very frustrating for users \u2018cause it\u2019s like, \u2018This is terrible.\u2019\u201d\nAnd yet, as much as she despises what this kind of SEO has done to the internet, Ray told me she hesitated to condemn the actual people doing it. \u201cI used to do those types of tactics, so I couldn\u2019t hate on anybody personally,\u201d she said. \u201cIf people have a problem with Google\u2019s results, they have to ask themselves, is it the fault of the SEOs?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr is this Google behaving differently than it used to?\u201d\nSullivan had tried to convince me that Google was not behaving differently and, in fact, had not changed its search criteria in any major way for the past 20 years. Google wanted you to make good websites, and that was that. Everyone who tried to rank higher by messing with the algorithm would be blocked. Sullivan even insisted that what these rule-breakers did should not be called SEO: he deemed it all \u201cspam.\u201d What is spam? \u201cSpam is stuff that search engines don\u2019t like.\u201d\nBut the line between strategies that violate Google\u2019s terms of service and strategies that don\u2019t has always been blurry and inconsistently enforced. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this much tension in the industry in terms of, like, what Google says to do and what people are doing and getting away with,\u201d Ray told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna tell us that this stuff doesn\u2019t work, make it stop working!\u201d\nRay seemed like the most reasonable person I had spoken to so far. Sure, she called herself a \u201cthought leader,\u201d and yes, sure, she had changed her last name to improve her personal branding by more closely associating herself with her grandmother\u2019s uncle, the artist Man Ray. Maybe some people would say that\u2019s the kind of absurd behavior that merits being attacked by an alligator, but I was beginning to come down on the side of the SEOs, who seemed to have a lot less agency than I\u2019d first imagined.\nGoogle had started with a noble cause: trying to make the internet easier to navigate at scale. The company did accomplish that goal, but in doing so, it inadvertently and profoundly changed how the internet looked. The problem lay in Google trying to be an objective and neutral arbiter of an information landscape that was meant to pretend it did not exist. You cannot design a free, automated system to help people find information without some people trying to game that system. You can\u2019t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at.\nFor the past 25 years, the internet as we know it has been almost entirely defined and controlled by Google. What the SEOs do matters for all of us on a daily basis, distorting how we perceive the world in ways we can hardly begin to imagine or understand. Yet any money that any SEO has made is a fraction of a crumb compared to Google\u2019s 10-layer cake. The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google\u2019s choices and priorities. As Google\u2019s founders wrote back in 1997: \u201cwe expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.\u201d\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s Google\u2019s world, and the SEOs are only living in it\nThere\u2019s a reason why most countries around the world have libraries that are public institutions: information that is controlled by a private business will always be subject to that business\u2019s bottom line. In the beginning, the internet was seen as an improvement on the spirit of the public library. Here was an opportunity to transcend the gatekeepers controlling who could publish a book, allowing mankind to fully connect and share knowledge. Instead, we have ended up in a situation arguably worse than before, where nearly all online information runs through a single company, which assumes a veneer of civic utility, of impassive authority, when it is very much not a neutral entity.\n\u201cThere were so many true believers at Google in the early days,\u201d Cutts told me. \u201cAs companies get big, it gets harder to get things done. Inevitably, people start to think about profit or quarterly numbers.\u201d He claimed that, at least while he was there, search quality always came before financial goals, but he believes that the public underestimates how Google is shaping what they see, saying, \u201cI deeply, deeply, deeply believe search engines are newspaper-like entities, making editorial decisions.\u201d He speculated that the company didn\u2019t want the public to think too hard about how search works because that awareness \u201cencourages regulators and makes people realize, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a lot of money here.\u2019\u201d\nThere has always been advertising and polemics from cranks, scammers, and liars. But now we see this stuff surfacing alongside truth, and we can\u2019t tell the difference. We move through our lives with a greater sense of distrust and fear and insecurity. At the end of the day, it\u2019s Google\u2019s world, and the SEOs are only living in it.\nAnd as much as I might hate the way the SEOs who don\u2019t follow Google\u2019s rules have altered my online experience, the reality is that most people running a company will break whatever rules they are able to get away with breaking. While Ray herself said she has left behind the guideline-violating tactics of her past, choosing instead to do as Google asks and make high-quality websites that will \u201cmake the internet a better place,\u201d as she put it, that kind of moral standard can be a lot to ask of someone running a business.\n\u201cThey want this wholesome thing, and I can understand that. That\u2019d be neat,\u201d said an SEO named Cade Lee. \u201cBut that\u2019s maybe in a world where we don\u2019t have money and greed and things, you know?\u201d\nLee was the person I spoke with on the phone before going to the alligator party, the guy who warned me that SEO was \u201cmodern-day pirate shit.\u201d He is among the SEOs who have spoken publicly, on panels, about violating Google\u2019s guidelines. He\u2019s also an ex-con who used to trade penny stocks and served time for securities fraud. His entire body is covered in tattoos, from his scalp to his legs to his fingers. When we met up for beers in Denver at a bar outside an escape room, he told me that his probation officer in the economic crime offenders unit has never tried to stop him from violating Google\u2019s terms of service.\n\u201cI was transparent about it, and they approved it,\u201d he said. They even approved \u201csome pretty questionable things, like in regards to adult sites,\u201d he told me, specifically involving what he\u2019d thought were ads for consensual sex workers. Later, an activist reached out and showed him how certain websites he had built were supporting human trafficking. Horrified, he shut the whole thing down, even then helping the activist with her website.\nThese days, Lee runs a construction company. His probation officer hates when he phrases it like this, but he thinks any way you make money is essentially a con or a scam of some kind. \u201cThe good con is like, you actually delivered, and you came through and made a profit.\u201d For example: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take that old lady\u2019s money to build her a brand new patio. There\u2019s that scam, and then there\u2019s, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s take her deposit and run.\u2019\u201d Lee is the kind of guy who has spent a lot of time thinking about his place in the world: what matters, what doesn\u2019t, and how his actions affect other people. He was in the Marines, he sold mortgages in the lead-up to the 2008 crash, he went to prison, he\u2019s done SEO. He understands that he needs to make money to survive, but he\u2019d like to do so in a way that is minimally harmful. So he prefers the good kind of con.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened with SEO for me \u2014 it was becoming bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cI was not feeling good about customer meetings and about what I was saying, and I was like, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis article, authored by Amanda Chicago Lewis, was published by The Verge on 2023-11-01 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":115}
{"title":"OpenAI hosts a dev day, TechCrunch reviews the M3 iMac and MacBook Pro, and Bumble gets a new CEO","context":"## OpenAI hosts a dev day, TechCrunch reviews the M3 iMac and MacBook Pro, and Bumble gets a new CEO\n\nHey, folks, and welcome to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch\u2019s newsletter covering the past week (or so) in tech industry happenings. This week marked OpenAI\u2019s first-ever dev conference, where the Microsoft-backed AI startup announced a host of new products. But that was far from the only item of note.\nIn this edition of WiR, we spotlight Brian\u2019s review of the 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Air and M3 iMac 24-inch; Mozilla betting on a decentralized social networking future; Ford shuttering a company that was building an app for plumbers, electricians and other trades; and Tim Cook\u2019s thoughts on generative AI. Also on the agenda is WeWork officially filing for bankruptcy, Bumble getting a new CEO, and the spectacular failure of EV startup Arrival.\nIt\u2019s a lot to get through, as always \u2014 so we won\u2019t delay. But first, a reminder to sign up here to receive WiR in your inbox every Saturday if you haven\u2019t already done so.\nMost read\nOpenAI throws a dev day: OpenAI hosted its first-ever developer conference on Monday, and the company had a lot to talk about. Some of the more notable items announced were tools to create custom \u201cGPTs\u201d (i.e., domain-specific chatbots), new text-to-speech models, an API for the text-to-image model DALL-E 3, and an improved version of OpenAI\u2019s flagship model, GPT-4, called GPT-4 Turbo.\nMac attack: Brian reviewed Apple\u2019s new 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro and the M3 iMac 24-inch. He found the iMac to be lacking and not necessarily worth the upgrade from the 2021 model, excepting the M3 chip, which brings \u201cimpressive\u201d performance gains over the already-powerful M1. As for the M3 Max MacBook Pro, Brian reports that, at $2,500 (plus some pricey add-ons), it successfully splits the difference between the Mac Studio and MacBook Air.\nMozilla bets on a decentralized future: Sarah spoke with Mozilla senior director of content Carolyn O\u2019Hara, who outlined Mozilla\u2019s strategy where it concerns the \u201cfediverse\u201d \u2014 a collection of decentralized social networking applications, like Mastodon, that communicate with one another over the ActivityPub protocol. The idea, O\u2019Hara said, is to rethink social networking from the ground up.\nFord shutters SaaS app for field work: Ford has shut down VIIZR, a software-as-a-service company that, along with Salesforce, built an app to help tradespeople like plumbers, locksmiths and electricians to schedule field appointments, send invoices and manage customers, Kirsten reports. VIIZR, which was announced in December 2021, was a separate company majority owned by Ford, with Salesforce as a minority investor.\nApple bets on generative AI: Apple CEO Tim Cook pushed back against the notion that the company was behind in AI on Apple\u2019s Q4 earnings call with investors, as he highlighted technology developments that Apple had made recently that \u201cwould not be possible without AI.\u201d Cook also said that Apple was working on generative AI technologies, lending credence to reports suggesting the company is on track to spend $1 billion per year on developing generative AI products.\nWeWork goes bust: As predicted, flexible office-space firm WeWork has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing over $18.6 billion of debt in a remarkable collapse for the once high-flying startup co-founded by Adam Neumann and bankrolled by SoftBank, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs.\nSlack\u2019s loss, Bumble\u2019s gain: Dating app Bumble announced a doozy this week: It\u2019s replacing founder CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd with Slack CEO Lidiane Jones. Jones only started as CEO at Slack last year, stepping in for another founder CEO, Stewart Butterfield. Ron and Sarah write that \u2014 while Bumble now has a clear line of succession \u2014 the move leaves Slack in a bit of a pickle.\nArrival fails to deliver: Arrival set out eight years ago to make electric vehicle production \u201cradically more efficient.\u201d So far, its plan to forgo the gigafactory for local microfactories has proved anything but, writes Harri \u2014 thanks to missed production targets, low cash reserves, layoffs and a pivot.\nAudio\nIt\u2019s winter, it ain\u2019t getting warmer (at least here in NYC), and I\u2019d argue that there\u2019s no better place to be than snuggled up indoors with a podcast for company. If you\u2019re in need of material, TechCrunch has a few that should definitely be on your radar.\nThis week on Equity, the crew dove deep into the encouraging signs from the fintech startup market, starting with Klarna\u2019s Q3 results. From there, they looked at buy now, pay later consumer behavior and fintech fundraising results with a 2021 flavor.\nMeanwhile, Found featured Nasrat Khalid of Aseel, which started as an e-commerce company making it possible for local artisans in Afghanistan to sell to customers across the world. It has evolved into working in humanitarian aid, delivering emergency food supplies to people in need in Afghanistan and Turkey.\nTechCrunch+\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber. If you\u2019re not, consider signing up. Here are a few highlights from this week:\nAnother superconductor disappointment: Tim writes that a new, supposedly room-temperature superconducting material isn\u2019t what the scientific community hoped it would be. With the Nature-published paper detailing the material facing retraction, the odds of researchers discovering a room-temperature superconductor are looking even longer.\nKlarna inches toward an IPO: Mary Ann and Alex write that Swedish fintech Klarna is taking steps toward an eventual IPO. The company has initiated a process for a legal entity restructuring to set up a holding company in the U.K. as an important early step in its plans for an initial public offering, a Klarna spokesperson tells TechCrunch+.\nThe unicorn\u2019s legacy isn\u2019t over: It\u2019s been 10 years since Cowboy Ventures\u2019 founder Aileen Lee coined an incredibly catchy nickname for what were very rare startups at the time: Unicorns. TechCrunch+ spoke with Lee about how she feels about the term 10 years later, now that her venture firm is also a decade old.\n\nThis article, authored by Kyle Wiggers, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-11-11 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":116}
{"title":"OpenAI buffs safety team and gives board veto power on risky AI","context":"## OpenAI buffs safety team and gives board veto power on risky AI\n\nOpenAI is expanding its internal safety processes to fend off the threat of harmful AI. A new \u201csafety advisory group\u201d will sit above the technical teams and make recommendations to leadership, and the board has been granted veto power \u2014 of course, whether it will actually use it is another question entirely.\nNormally the ins and outs of policies like these don\u2019t necessitate coverage, as in practice they amount to a lot of closed-door meetings with obscure functions and responsibility flows that outsiders will seldom be privy to. Though that\u2019s likely also true in this case, the recent leadership fracas and evolving AI risk discussion warrant taking a look at how the world\u2019s leading AI development company is approaching safety considerations.\nIn a new document and blog post, OpenAI discusses their updated \u201cPreparedness Framework,\u201d which one imagines got a bit of a retool after November\u2019s shake-up that removed the board\u2019s two most \u201cdecelerationist\u201d members: Ilya Sutskever (still at the company in a somewhat changed role) and Helen Toner (totally gone).\nThe main purpose of the update appears to be to show a clear path for identifying, analyzing, and deciding what do to about \u201ccatastrophic\u201d risks inherent to models they are developing. As they define it:\nBy catastrophic risk, we mean any risk which could result in hundreds of billions of dollars in economic damage or lead to the severe harm or death of many individuals \u2014 this includes, but is not limited to, existential risk.\n(Existential risk is the \u201crise of the machines\u201d type stuff.)\nIn-production models are governed by a \u201csafety systems\u201d team; this is for, say, systematic abuses of ChatGPT that can be mitigated with API restrictions or tuning. Frontier models in development get the \u201cpreparedness\u201d team, which tries to identify and quantify risks before the model is released. And then there\u2019s the \u201csuperalignment\u201d team, which is working on theoretical guide rails for \u201csuperintelligent\u201d models, which we may or may not be anywhere near.\nThe first two categories, being real and not fictional, have a relatively easy-to-understand rubric. Their teams rate each model on four risk categories: cybersecurity, \u201cpersuasion\u201d (e.g., disinfo), model autonomy (i.e., acting on its own), and CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats; e.g., the ability to create novel pathogens).\nVarious mitigations are assumed: For instance, a reasonable reticence to describe the process of making napalm or pipe bombs. After taking into account known mitigations, if a model is still evaluated as having a \u201chigh\u201d risk, it cannot be deployed, and if a model has any \u201ccritical\u201d risks, it will not be developed further.\nThese risk levels are actually documented in the framework, in case you were wondering if they are to be left to the discretion of some engineer or product manager.\nFor example, in the cybersecurity section, which is the most practical of them, it is a \u201cmedium\u201d risk to \u201cincrease the productivity of operators . . . on key cyber operation tasks\u201d by a certain factor. A high-risk model, on the other hand, would \u201cidentify and develop proofs-of-concept for high-value exploits against hardened targets without human intervention.\u201d Critical is \u201cmodel can devise and execute end-to-end novel strategies for cyberattacks against hardened targets given only a high level desired goal.\u201d Obviously we don\u2019t want that out there (though it would sell for quite a sum).\nI\u2019ve asked OpenAI for more information on how these categories are defined and refined \u2014 for instance, if a new risk like photorealistic fake video of people goes under \u201cpersuasion\u201d or a new category \u2014 and will update this post if I hear back.\nSo, only medium and high risks are to be tolerated one way or another. But the people making those models aren\u2019t necessarily the best ones to evaluate them and make recommendations. For that reason, OpenAI is making a \u201ccross-functional Safety Advisory Group\u201d that will sit on top of the technical side, reviewing the boffins\u2019 reports and making recommendations inclusive of a higher vantage. Hopefully (they say) this will uncover some \u201cunknown unknowns,\u201d though by their nature those are fairly difficult to catch.\nThe process requires these recommendations to be sent simultaneously to the board and leadership, which we understand to mean CEO Sam Altman and CTO Mira Murati, plus their lieutenants. Leadership will make the decision on whether to ship it or fridge it, but the board will be able to reverse those decisions.\nThis will hopefully short-circuit anything like what was rumored to have happened before the big drama, a high-risk product or process getting greenlit without the board\u2019s awareness or approval. Of course, the result of said drama was the sidelining of two of the more critical voices and the appointment of some money-minded guys (Bret Taylor and Larry Summers), who are sharp but not AI experts by a long shot.\nIf a panel of experts makes a recommendation, and the CEO makes decisions based on that information, will this friendly board really feel empowered to contradict them and hit the brakes? And if they do, will we hear about it? Transparency is not really addressed outside a promise that OpenAI will solicit audits from independent third parties.\nSay a model is developed that warrants a \u201ccritical\u201d risk category. OpenAI hasn\u2019t been shy about tooting its horn about this kind of thing in the past \u2014 talking about how wildly powerful their models are, to the point where they decline to release them, is great advertising. But do we have any kind of guarantee this will happen, if the risks are so real and OpenAI is so concerned about them? Maybe it\u2019s a bad idea. But either way it isn\u2019t really mentioned.\n\nThis article, authored by Devin Coldewey, was published by TechCrunch on 2023-12-18 under the category 'technology'.\n\n","id":117}
{"title":"Top 25 MLB offseason trade candidates","context":"## Top 25 MLB offseason trade candidates\n\nWhile the offseason has gotten rolling, trade season hasn\u2019t quite arrived. The Tigers acquired Mark Canha from Milwaukee in the biggest swap of the first couple weeks. Otherwise, the GM Meetings simply served to set the stage for future transactions.\nThat\u2019ll surely involve some notable trades. Unlike the summer deadline, projecting which players will change hands is difficult at this stage of the offseason.\nAside from the A\u2019s, there aren\u2019t any teams clearly in rebuild mode. Clubs like the Rockies, Royals, White Sox, Nationals and Angels have uphill paths to contention, yet none has indicated they\u2019re prepared to punt on the 2024 season entirely.\nThe Padres, Twins, Rays, Brewers and Guardians are all aiming to contend but have questions about their payroll. That\u2019s standard operating procedure for Tampa Bay, Milwaukee and Cleveland. San Diego and, to a lesser extent, Minnesota have shown a willingness to spend in recent years but are scaling back \u2014 in both cases, likely tied to their uncertain local television rights contracts.\nThat informs the offseason trade landscape, which is headlined by a few stars deep into their arbitration windows. Without many clear rebuilders, it\u2019s possible we see more swaps of big leaguers at positions of need between teams that expect to compete.\nBefore we get to the list, a note on methodology. This isn\u2019t a strict ranking of players\u2019 trade value, nor is it solely about likelihood of being moved. We\u2019re trying to balance both of those things, an inherently subjective exercise.\nAll projected salaries for arbitration-eligible players are courtesy of MLBTR contributor Matt Swartz.\n1. Juan Soto, LF, Padres\nOther than Shohei Ohtani\u2019s free agency, there may be no bigger story of the offseason than Soto\u2019s future in San Diego. He is entering his final year of club control, projected for a $33M salary that would be the highest ever for an arbitration-eligible player.\nThe Padres are scaling back payroll, perhaps as much as $50M. They need multiple starting pitchers and could stand to upgrade at first base and\/or designated hitter.\nTrading Soto would allow the Friars to recoup MLB-ready talent while clearing significant spending room for multiple smaller additions. It would also be a devastating blow to the lineup. Soto overcame a relatively slow start (by his standards) to hit .275\/.410\/.519 with 35 home runs this year.\nThe Padres are still motivated to win in the short term. Barring what would be a stunning run at Ohtani, they\u2019re not going to acquire anyone better than Soto.\nPresident of baseball operations A.J. Preller continues to maintain they\u2019ll explore a long-term deal. There\u2019s nothing to suggest an extension is particularly likely. Soto rejected a $440M offer from the Nationals before he was traded at the 2022 deadline. The price would only be higher now that he\u2019s a year and a half closer to free agency.\nIn the absence of an extension or a definitive declaration that Soto is off the trade market, speculation will linger. Alden Gonz\u00e1lez of ESPN wrote last week that many throughout the industry believe the three-time All-Star will be available.\n2. Corbin Burnes, SP, Brewers\n3. Willy Adames, SS, Brewers\nBurnes and Adames are tied together with good reason. They\u2019re each one year from the open market and projected for a noteworthy arbitration salary \u2014 $15.1M for Burnes, $12.4M for Adames. Milwaukee is reportedly open to offers on the majority of the roster.\nA former Cy Young winner, Burnes may be the best pitcher available in trade. The right-hander posted a sub-3.00 ERA each season from 2020-22. His 3.39 mark across 193 2\/3 innings this past season wasn\u2019t quite so dominant but is still high-end production.\nBurnes struck out just under 26% of opposing hitters. While his lowest mark since his rookie season, that\u2019s still an above-average figure.\nAdames is coming off a less impressive year. The 28-year-old hit .217\/.310\/.407 through 638 trips to the plate. That\u2019s slightly below-average offense, although he still connected on 24 home runs.\nAdames is an excellent defensive shortstop with plus power in an offseason where there are essentially no free agent shortstops of note. Even with a mediocre on-base percentage, he\u2019d generate plenty of interest.\n4. Shane Bieber, SP, Guardians\nDevelop high-end starting pitching, trade a top starter as they become more expensive, replace him with talented younger arms. The Guardians have trodden this path with Corey Kluber, Mike Clevinger and Carlos Carrasco. Bieber, one year from free agency with a projected $12.2M salary, could be next.\nCleveland has the likes of Tanner Bibee, Gavin Williams, Logan Allen, Triston McKenzie and Cal Quantrill (himself a potential trade candidate) as rotation options. While Bieber is no longer a Cy Young caliber pitcher, he turned in a 3.80 ERA with a below-average but serviceable 20.1% strikeout rate over 21 starts this past season.\nBieber lost a good chunk of the second half to elbow inflammation but returned to make two appearances in late September.\n5. Tyler Glasnow, SP, Rays\nThe Rays signed Glasnow to an extension in August 2022 when he was completing his rehab from Tommy John surgery. The big right-hander is set to make $25M next season, the largest single-year salary in franchise history.\nThat naturally leads to questions about whether the Rays are prepared to meet that figure, particularly in an offseason where they have a loaded arbitration class.\nIf they made him available \u2014 and he\u2019s already surfaced in rumors \u2014 Glasnow would be a very appealing target. He was quite good this year, working to a 3.53 ERA while striking out more than a third of opponents over 21 starts. An oblique strain cost him the first two months of the season, but he avoided the injured list thereafter.\nHe\u2019s a year away from free agency, making another extension with Tampa Bay appear unlikely. Yet dealing him would represent a tough blow to the Rays\u2019 chances of competing in 2024. They\u2019re already down Shane McClanahan for the entire season and will be without Jeffrey Springs and Drew Rasmussen for at least a good portion of the year.\nWhile they\u2019d likely bring back some kind of MLB help as part of a Glasnow trade return, the rotation depth could be a problem.\n6. Dylan Cease, SP, White Sox\nCease had a disappointing follow-up to his Cy Young runner-up campaign. He allowed a 4.58 ERA over 177 innings this past season. That\u2019s nearly two and a half runs higher than his sparkling 2.20 mark of the prior year. As is often the case, his true talent probably lies somewhere in the middle.\nCease still missed plenty of bats \u2014 27.3% strikeout rate, 13.6% swinging strike percentage \u2014 while issuing a few more walks than ideal. His fastball averaged 95.6 mph, down a tick from the preceding season.\nThe right-hander has shown the ability to pitch at an ace-caliber level. He is two seasons from free agency and projected for an $8.8M arbitration salary, making him more affordable than the other high-end starting pitchers near the top of this list.\nThe extra year of control probably gives him more trade value than any of Burnes, Bieber or Glasnow. It also makes him less likely to be traded this offseason.\nFirst-year GM Chris Getz has suggested no one on the roster is truly untouchable, an understandable approach for a team that just lost 101 games. Neither owner Jerry Reinsdorf nor Getz has called this a rebuild, though.\nAny slim hopes the White Sox may have of competing in 2024 would be dashed by trading Cease, the only above-average starting pitcher on the roster.\n7. Alex Verdugo, RF, Red Sox\nVerdugo\u2019s name has been floated in trade rumors for a few seasons. The Red Sox have held onto him thus far. They have a new baseball operations leader in Craig Breslow, who has acknowledged the team has gotten early calls on the left-handed hitting outfielder.\nJarren Duran and Masataka Yoshida also hit from the left side. Dealing Verdugo could free some at-bats for a right-handed addition while perhaps bringing in immediate help for the pitching staff or at second base.\nMLBTR projects Verdugo for a $9.2M salary in his final season of arbitration. He\u2019s coming off another league-average offensive showing, when he hit .264\/.324\/.421 with 13 home runs through 602 plate appearances.\nVerdugo hasn\u2019t become the All-Star player the Sox envisioned when building the Mookie Betts return around him. He\u2019s a solid regular, a high-contact hitter who rates as a decent defender in right field.\n8. Trent Grisham, CF, Padres\n9. Ha-Seong Kim, 2B, Padres\nIf the Padres hold Soto, dealing Grisham and\/or Kim could be an alternative means of trimming payroll. While neither is going to make anywhere near Soto money in 2024, they\u2019re each on mid-level salaries of note.\nGrisham is projected for a $4.9M salary in his second-to-last season of arbitration. Kim is slated for an $8M salary and will be due a $2M buyout on a 2025 mutual option at season\u2019s end. He\u2019ll be a free agent next winter.\nGrisham has the extra year of control but is the worse player. He draws plenty of walks but has hit below the Mendoza line in two straight seasons. He\u2019s coming off a .198\/.315\/.352 line over 555 plate appearances. The appeal is on the other side of the ball.\nGrisham is an above-average defensive center fielder, keeping him as a low-end regular even if he\u2019s best suited for the bottom of a lineup. San Diego could kick Fernando Tatis Jr. over to center field if they dealt Grisham, freeing right field for a bigger offensive threat than Grisham provides.\nIt\u2019s a similar story with Kim. Dealing him would free Jake Cronenworth to move back to second base, opening first base for a better hitter. It\u2019d be tough to replace Kim\u2019s overall production, though. He\u2019s a plus defender at multiple infield spots.\nHe hit .260\/.351\/.398 with 17 home runs and stole 38 bases in 152 games. Trading Kim isn\u2019t as damaging to the lineup as a Soto deal would be, but it\u2019d be tougher than parting with Grisham.\n10. Gleyber Torres, 2B, Yankees\nAnother player one year from free agency, Torres is projected for a $15.3M salary in his last arbitration season. That\u2019s below his market value but a notable figure for a bat-first second baseman \u2014 a general profile that the league has devalued in recent years.\nTorres was New York\u2019s second-best offensive player in 2023, hitting .273\/.347\/.453 with 25 homers through 672 trips to the plate.\nEven if they\u2019re not interested in an extension, New York could hold Torres for his final season of club control. They\u2019re already light on consistent hitting beyond Aaron Judge. On the surface, trading their second-best hitter seems counterintuitive.\nThe big question is whether the front office believes Oswald Peraza is capable of stepping into an everyday second base role in 2024. If they feel the 23-year-old is ready, trading Torres to clear spending room while bringing back outfield or pitching help makes sense.\n11. Jonathan India, 2B, Reds\nThe Reds\u2019 infield surplus has fueled trade speculation on India back to the deadline. Cincinnati didn\u2019t seem inclined to make that move midseason, pointing to India\u2019s role as a clubhouse leader. While that\u2019s certainly still a factor, he didn\u2019t hit well down the stretch and finished the year with a middling .244\/.338\/.407 batting line. He\u2019s a well below-average keystone defender.\nThere\u2019s an argument the Reds are better off relying on an up-the-middle tandem of Matt McLain and either Noelvi Marte or Elly De La Cruz. Perhaps the offseason is a better time to consider moving India for a back-end starter.\nThe former Rookie of the Year is projected for a $3.7M salary and has three seasons of remaining arbitration control.\n12. Eloy Jim\u00e9nez, DH, White Sox\nJim\u00e9nez no longer looks like a core piece for the White Sox. Various injuries have kept him off the field throughout his big league tenure. He only has two seasons of 100+ games and hasn\u2019t gotten to 500 plate appearances since his 2019 rookie year.\nJim\u00e9nez was still an excellent hitter when healthy as recently as 2022, when he ran a .295\/.358\/.500 line over 84 games. His production fell this year, as he posted a .272\/.317\/.441 slash with 18 homers over 489 trips to the dish.\nThat\u2019s not especially imposing for a player who\u2019s best suited at DH. Yet Jim\u00e9nez has shown greater offensive upside that isn\u2019t matched by many in this winter\u2019s free agent class. If the Sox are prepared to move on, another team could look to buy low.\nHe\u2019ll make a $13M salary next year, the final guaranteed season of his contract. He\u2019s guaranteed a $3M buyout on a $16.5M club option for 2025 and the deal contains an $18.5M team option for the \u201926 campaign.\n13. Max Kepler, RF, Twins\n14. Jorge Polanco , 2B, Twins\nMinnesota president of baseball operations Derek Falvey has confirmed the team is paring back payroll. The Athletic\u2019s Dan Hayes reported the organization could end in the $125M-140M range. At the moment, they have around $120M in projected spending.\nThe Twins have a few ways to clear room. Trading either Kepler or Polanco would accomplish that. The former is making $10M, while the latter is playing on a $10.5M deal. Kepler will be a free agent after next season; Polanco\u2019s contract has a $12.5M team option for 2025 that comes with a $750K buyout.\nThey\u2019re each good players. Kepler is a plus defender in right field who hit .260\/.332\/.484 with 24 homers this year. Polanco was limited to 80 games but ran a .255\/.335\/.454 showing. He\u2019s one of the sport\u2019s better offensive second basemen and saw some third base action for Minnesota late in the year.\nThe Twins have Matt Wallner and Trevor Larnach as left-handed hitting corner outfield options. They\u2019re deeper on the infield, where Willi Castro and Kyle Farmer (another trade candidate) are possibilities at second\/third base behind starters Edouard Julien and Royce Lewis.\nTop prospect Brooks Lee, the No. 8 overall pick in 2022, isn\u2019t far from MLB readiness. The Twins could look to move Kepler or Polanco for rotation depth or to bring in a righty bat to balance the lineup.\n15. Randy Arozarena, LF, Rays\nArozarena hasn\u2019t been the subject of the same level of trade speculation as Glasnow has. There\u2019s an argument the Rays should be more willing to move the All-Star outfielder if they\u2019re looking to create payroll room.\nTampa Bay has greater depth in the outfield than they do on their injury-riddled pitching staff. Josh Lowe, Jose Siri, Harold Ram\u00edrez, Luke Raley and Manuel Margot are all on hand. (Margot has come up in trade rumors as well.)\nNone of those players is as good as Arozarena. Trading star players for younger talent is familiar territory for the Tampa Bay front office though. Arozarena is projected for a $9M arbitration salary and controllable for three seasons. He\u2019d have significant trade value if the Rays were to consider moving him.\n16. Mariners SP\nWe initially had Bryan Woo in this spot. It could just as easily have been Bryce Miller or Emerson Hancock, so we\u2019ll cheat and just mention the Seattle rotation in general.\nThey\u2019re almost certainly not going to trade George Kirby. It\u2019d take a lot to pry away Logan Gilbert. Moving any of Woo, Miller or Hancock could be more appealing for a front office that is looking for ways to add long-term offensive upside.\nNone of that trio has even reached one year of major league service. Hancock only has three big league starts under his belt. Miller and Woo spent more time in the rotation this year, starting 25 and 18 games respectively. They both turned in mid-rotation results.\nOther clubs probably have differing opinions on which right-hander they prefer. (The Mariners likely have their own slight preferences.) They\u2019d all have significant value if president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto decided to move one for a bat.\n17. Dylan Carlson, CF, Cardinals\nIt was a bit of a surprise that Carlson didn\u2019t change hands over the summer. Various reports suggested the Cards were making him available as they looked for ways to add a controllable starter. It didn\u2019t happen, but the same logic applies this winter.\nCarlson has been surpassed by Lars Nootbaar as the starting center fielder. St. Louis needs multiple starting pitchers and will likely bring in at least one via trade. Carlson probably has less value than he did before the deadline. Not only did he finish with a mediocre .219\/.318\/.333 batting line, he underwent season-ending surgery on his left ankle in September.\nThere\u2019d nevertheless be teams willing to take a shot on a former top prospect who looked like an average or better center fielder 12 months ago. Carlson is projected for a modest $1.8M salary and has three years of arbitration control.\n18. Paul Blackburn, SP, A\u2019s\nBlackburn is arguably the most desirable realistic trade candidate on the Oakland roster. The A\u2019s have torn things to the studs. They\u2019re unlikely to compete within the two remaining years of Blackburn\u2019s arbitration window. The right-hander (30 next month) worked to a 4.43 ERA with a decent 22.4% strikeout rate over 103 2\/3 innings this past season.\nHe\u2019s projected for a $3.2M salary. A Blackburn trade isn\u2019t going to be an offseason defining move, but he has a good chance to be flipped to a contender seeking affordable back-end starting pitching.\n19. Alek Manoah, SP, Blue Jays\nPerhaps no player had a more disappointing 2023 performance than Manoah. Within one season, he went from Cy Young finalist to essentially unplayable. The right-hander pitched to a 5.87 ERA over 19 big league outings. His walks more than doubled while his strikeouts fell from 22.9% to a modest 19% clip.\nHe lost his spot in the Toronto rotation and was eventually demoted to the minors. Manoah never pitched in Triple-A and received an injection in his throwing shoulder at the end of the season.\nHow will the Jays proceed after that disastrous year? General manager Ross Atkins said last week the team would give him \u201ca strong leg up\u201d on the No. 5 spot in the rotation. The Jays aren\u2019t broadcasting a desire to trade him, although they wouldn\u2019t be doing themselves any favors if they declared they were ready to move on.\nDealing Manoah to bring in a lower upside but higher floor pitcher wouldn\u2019t be a surprise with the Jays firmly in win-now mode. The former first-round pick is controllable for four more seasons and won\u2019t reach arbitration until next winter.\n20. Brandon Drury, 2B, Angels\nThe Halos signed Drury to a two-year free agent deal last winter. The righty-hitting infielder turned in a nice season, connecting on 26 home runs with a .262\/.306\/.497 line across 523 plate appearances. Next year\u2019s $8.5M salary looks like strong value, particularly in an offseason where the supply of up-the-middle players is thin.\nThe Angels probably aren\u2019t kicking off a rebuild. They could do a shorter-term retool if Ohtani walks, or they could simply look to move Drury for pitching while turning second base to Luis Rengifo and\/or an external acquisition.\n21. Brendan Donovan, 2B, Cardinals\nDonovan is a longer shot trade possibility if the Cards move a controllable hitter for starting pitching. He\u2019s more valuable than Carlson and less likely to be on the move.\nAt the same time, he\u2019d net a clearer rotation upgrade if St. Louis were to give him up \u2014 likely turning the middle infield over to a combination of Tommy Edman, Nolan Gorman and Masyn Winn in that scenario.\nThe 26-year-old hit .284\/.365\/.422 with 11 homers through 371 plate appearances this past season. A flexor tendon injury pushed him to designated hitter and eventually required surgery that ended his year a couple months early. He\u2019s expected back for spring training.\nIf healthy, Donovan brings excellent contact skills and a solid plate approach. He\u2019s a multi-positional defender who can play any of the corners in addition to second base. Donovan has four years of remaining control and won\u2019t get to arbitration until next offseason.\n22. Christopher Morel, DH, Cubs\nMorel is likely to be a divisive player around the league. He has huge raw power and connected on 26 home runs while slugging .508 in 107 games for the Cubs. The right-handed hitter owns a .241\/.311\/.471 line in just over 850 MLB plate appearances over the past two seasons. When he\u2019s hot, he can carry a lineup.\nHe also strikes out more than 30% of the time and doesn\u2019t have a defensive fit. Morel has played all three outfield spots and each of second base, third base and shortstop in the majors. He hasn\u2019t rated well anywhere.\nThe Cubs used him mostly at designated hitter this year and have suggested they\u2019ll get him first base run in 2024. That\u2019s not a great fit for a plus runner with top-of-the-scale arm strength, yet Morel hasn\u2019t shown himself capable of handling more important positions on a regular basis.\nHow teams project Morel defensively could impact both whether he\u2019s traded and what kind of return the Cubs could receive. As a first baseman or DH, he\u2019s a fringe regular with a statistical profile that\u2019d paint him as a lumbering slugger as opposed to a dynamic athlete. If another team feels he can hold his own at second base or in center field, he becomes far more desirable.\nThe Cubs have no urgency to trade him. Morel is controllable through 2028 and won\u2019t reach arbitration for at least another season. Yet president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer has alluded to the possibility of a deal, saying last week that \u201canother team might be able to put him [at second base],\u201d where the Cubs have Nico Hoerner.\n23. Christian V\u00e1zquez, C, Twins\nTrading V\u00e1zquez is another route Minnesota could consider to clear money. The Twins signed the veteran catcher to a three-year, $30M free agent deal last offseason. He had a tough first season in Minneapolis, limping to a .223\/.280\/.318 line over 355 plate appearances \u2014 albeit with his typical brand of excellent defense.\nRyan Jeffers easily surpassed him as the No. 1 option on the depth chart. A $10M per year backup catcher is a luxury for a team trying to trim salary.\nMinnesota likely wouldn\u2019t be able to offload the entire deal, but they could try to shed around half the money or take on a smaller contract in return.\nV\u00e1zquez\u2019s year wasn\u2019t much worse than a season that got Omar Narv\u00e1ez two years and $15M last winter, while Tucker Barnhart secured a two-year, $6.5M guarantee despite a much lesser offensive track record.\n24. Luis Robert Jr., CF, White Sox\nRobert has the most trade value of any player on this list. He may also be the least likely to move. Last week, Getz called him a franchise building block and noted he had no plans to proactively shop Robert even as he left open the possibility of listening to offers on anyone.\nIt\u2019s not hard to understand why. Robert\u2019s an elite defensive center fielder who connected on 38 home runs while hitting .264\/.315\/.542. It was the first time he stayed healthy for a 162-game schedule. The result was a season that\u2019ll get him down-ballot MVP support.\nRobert is a prime-aged superstar and, unlike Soto or Burnes, he\u2019s nowhere near free agency. He\u2019ll make $12.5M next year, $15M in 2025 and is controllable via $20M team options for 2026-27. Trading Robert would signify a complete teardown that the Sox probably don\u2019t want. Yet the haul would be astronomical if they decided to go in that direction.\n25. Pete Alonso, 1B, Mets\nAlonso was the subject of early offseason trade speculation. With the Mets projecting a less active offseason and placing a priority on 2025, it wasn\u2019t out of the question he could be available. Alonso is projected for a $22M arbitration salary and will be a free agent after next year.\nNew York has subsequently walked back some of their statements about a possible retool. They\u2019re still aiming to compete in \u201924 even if they\u2019re signaling they won\u2019t blow away the top of the free agent market.\nFirst-year president of baseball operations David Stearns has twice publicly said he anticipates Alonso being the Opening Day first baseman in Queens. That won\u2019t stop teams from trying, but an offseason deal looks decidedly unlikely.\nOthers of note\nA\u2019s: Seth Brown\nBraves: Vaughn Grissom\nBrewers: Adrian Houser, Devin Williams, Brandon Woodruff\nCardinals: Alec Burleson, Tommy Edman, Nolan Gorman, Tyler O\u2019Neill\nGiants: J.D.

{"title":"NFL power rankings: Lions, 49ers level up; Texans jump Bengals, Bills; Jets, Patriots sink to bottom for Week 11","context":"## NFL power rankings: Lions, 49ers level up; Texans jump Bengals, Bills; Jets, Patriots sink to bottom for Week 11\n\nWeek 10 in the NFL had some of the league's best teams not playing. But that didn't stop the excitement, with five teams winning on walk-off field goals and more games coming right down to the wire.\nWith that, there were some surprising results and expected domination. Some favorites dug deep to win. Some underdogs turned in shocking upsets.\nPutting the latest wins and losses into a blender, here's Sporting News' updated look at how all teams stack up against each other, 1-32 going into Week 11:\nNFL WEEK 11 PICKS: Straight up | Against the spread\nNFL power rankings Week 11\n1. Philadelphia Eagles 8-1 (previous week: 1)\nThe Eagles enjoyed a bye trying to get a little healthier for the more difficult stretch run in a top-heavy NFC as they have tough games at the Chiefs (the Super Bowl 57 rematch), vs. the Bills, vs. 49ers and at the Cowboys in the next four. They still look like the conference team to beat as they have proved they still win in many ways around Jalen Hurts.\n2. Kansas City Chiefs 7-2 (3)\nThe Chiefs had a pretty good week off given they jumped back into the AFC's top seed and home-field advantage spot with the Ravens losing. They already are rolling defensively and expect them to figure out a lot more around Patrick Mahomes after the key Andy Reid bye.\n3. Detroit Lions 7-2 (5)\nThe Lions are becoming like the Eagles, and that's what makes them the second-best team in the NFC. They can win shootouts with Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown and their passing game. They also can dominate with the running game. They can win with offense or defense. Dan Campbell is coach of the year.\n4. San Francisco 49ers 6-3 (8)\nThe 49ers had a surprise offensive get-well game in Jacksonville with Brock Purdy leading the way and all his key supporting weapons doing damage, even without Christian McCaffrey scoring. The biggest development was the defense going back to dominating a good offense.\n5. Baltimore Ravens 7-3 (2)\nThe Ravens' offense is just fine with the running and passing of Lamar Jackson, but he still can't afford to make big mistakes, which he did vs. the Browns. The defense needs to pick up the pieces, too, stat, ahead of facing the Bengals on a short week.\n6. Miami Dolphins 6-3 (6)\nThe Dolphins got a much-needed bye to figure out how to beat the better teams in the league. Their defense should be getting a little better to support their often explosive offense. They should feel good about a Week 11 rebound vs. the Raiders.\n7. Pittsburgh Steelers 6-3 (9)\nThe Steelers are playing the way Mike Tomlin wants, with the running game rolling to big totals with Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris and the defense doing what it needs, more so vs. pass than run, in key moments. You can't argue with the overachieving results.\n8. Cleveland Browns 6-3 (10)\nThe Browns proved they can win games with defense in another way, with big plays. They also have more offensive pop when Deshaun Watson plays well and the running game doesn't slump. Their playoff hopes look much better after their stunning comeback vs. the Ravens.\n9. Jacksonville Jaguars 6-3 (4)\nThe Jaguars got an NFC wake-up call against the 49ers, who were much more prepared after a Week 9 bye than they were. Jacksonville needs to forget that debacle and get back on track, stat. The team gets a division double vs. Tennessee and Houston before facing Cincinnati.\n10. Dallas Cowboys 6-3 (11)\nThe Cowboys took advantage of their \"no contest\" vs. the Giants at home with Dak Prescott continuing to ball as a passer and runner. They need to keep the defense and running game success, too, in bigger games going forward.\nMORE: Inside the Cowboys historic offensive explosion vs. Giants\n11. Seattle Seahawks 6-3 (13)\nThe Seahawks needed every ounce of their offense around Geno Smith to rally to beat the Commanders, but the get-well performance worked well for him, Kenneth Walker and the wide receivers. The defense could be more consistent.\n12. Minnesota Vikings 6-4 (14)\nThe new man on the Vikings, Josh Dobbs, keeps producing the same results they were enjoying offensively with Kirk Cousins, thanks to more help from the running game for Kevin O'Connell and the defense overall under Brian Flores. Their 0-3 and 1-4 starts are distant memories as the Vikings look for a sixth straight win in Week 11 vs. Denver.\n13. Houston Texans 5-4 (16)\nThe Texans are looking great with C.J. Stroud leading their offense and now they've found some running game, too. The defense is just making enough plays to put them in position to win high-scoring games. Houston is a legitimate playoff contender under rookie coach DeMeco Ryans.\n14. Cincinnati Bengals 5-4 (7)\nThe Bengals are battling some key injuries, leaving them much less room for error. Unfortunately, Joe Burrow made key mistakes and the defense wilted against run and pass at home in the loss to the Texans.\n15. Buffalo Bills 5-5 (12)\nThe Bills fell right into the trap game against the Broncos at home, losing because of more mistakes from Josh Allen. The defense can't tolerate those mistakes with all of its injuries.\n16. Las Vegas Raiders 5-5 (22)\nThe Raiders are hot, having won two consecutive games for interim coach Antonio Pierce, bringing up flashbacks to the playoff push they made with Rich Bisaccia in 2021. They are right back in the AFC wild-card race with the Dolphins, Chiefs, Vikings ahead.\n17. New Orleans Saints 5-5 (15)\nThe Saints will go into a bye not knowing what do at quarterback. with Derek Carr further hurting his right shoulder and needed to be checked for a concussion. Jameis Winston did provide a spark, too little too late at Minnesota. But the division lead is precarious with poor QB play overall.\n19. Indianapolis Colts 5-5 (19)\nThe Colts stopped scoring at least 20 points in every game during their ugly, run-heavy victory in Germany vs. the Patriots. At least Jonathan Taylor is doing his normal things and the defense is playing well again while Gardner Minshew looks meh.\n18. Los Angeles Chargers 4-5 (17)\nThe Chargers got well offensively with Justin Herbert, Keenan Allen and Austin Ekeler against the Lions. But the defense went back to crumbling vs. big pass plays and added wilting against the run. The pressure is right back on Brandon Staley with a trip to Green Bay next.\n20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 4-5 (23)\nBaker Mayfield and the offense is back on track to move the ball well after a brief midseason slump. They're still not lighting it up, but the Bucs are back to playing smart complementary football with their defense rebounding and still might have found a long-term QB answer.\n21. New York Jets 4-5 (18)\nAaron Rodgers can't come back soon enough, and going for a December miracle might be too late after two straight key losses to the Chargers and Raiders. Zach Wilson will always cap the potential of a talented offense that keeps making mistakes. The Bills and Dolphins in back-to-back division games next might be their season.\n22. Denver Broncos 4-5 (24)\nThe Broncos got another big win against a AFC power, sandwiching their Week 9 bye with upsets over the Chiefs and Bills. The offense has hit a balanced grooved with Russell Wilson and the defense is making a lot more plays, too.\n23. Washington Commanders 4-5 (21)\nThe Commanders should be pleased about Sam Howell and the offense showing more fight with additional weapons and the running backs look better all-around again. But the reeling defense and pass protection continue to be un-winnable assets.\n24. Atlanta Falcons 4-5 (20)\nThe Falcons were forced into another QB change because of injury. They found a few more answers offensively but that position still made it an overall mess. The defense also doesn't seem to be well prepared to different styles of offenses.\n25. Green Bay Packers 3-6 (25)\nThe Packers saw some improved work from Jordan Love and his young weapons as they spread the ball well in the passing game, but the run defense woes and key holes in coverage have all but doomed their playoff hopes.\n26. Los Angeles Rams 3-6 (26)\nThe Rams are hoping to find a few more answers during a bye, as Sean McVay has seen his good coaching job earlier in the season go by the wayside with key offensive injuries. They need Matthew Stafford to help save face the rest of the way or the season will look a lot like 2022.\n27. Tennessee Titans 3-6 (27)\nWill Levis is going through rookie lumps after his dazzling debut as the brutal offensive line woes exacerbated by injuries are getting to him and the entire Titans offense. The Titans still need to keep starting him, because they can't overcome those systemic problems or those in overall pass defense.\n28. Chicago Bears 3-7 (29)\nThe Bears don't care how they win, but they should be pleased their running game and defense bailed out their limited passing game with Tyson Bagent to secure another win in Week 10. They will hope to finish strong with Justin Fields soon.\n29. Arizona Cardinals 2-8 (32)\nThe Cardinals got an immediate spark for their offense with Kyler Murray and James Conner back. They also seemed invigorated for Jonathan Gannon on defense and special teams. Look for the Cardinals to finish strong and play a whole lot of spoiler.\n30. New England Patriots 2-8 (28)\nThe Patriots tried to win a game by hiding Mac Jones and their quarterbacks in general. They almost pulled it off with the running game dominating and short-handed defense making a lot of plays, but they didn't see the results in Germany ahead of a tough bye for Bill Belichick.\n31. New York Giants 2-8 (30)\nThe Giants can just flush away this season without Daniel Jones and Tyrod Taylor. The injuries go to their offense early and remained relentless, and now their defense is falling apart, too. The question is, will Brian Daboll get a massive mulligan after his rookie playoff leadership?\n32. Carolina Panthers 1-8 (31)\nThe Panthers found better defense and special teams to keep them in the game in Chicago, but Bryce Young still can't unlock a limited passing game and the offensive line and running game hasn't help nearly enough.\n\nThis article, authored by Vinnie Iyer, was published by Sporting News on 2023-11-13 under the category 'sports'.\n\n","id":119}
